first off i want to say that i lean liberal on the political scale and i found the movie offensive i managed to watch the whole of a film this movie brings a low to original ideas yes it was original thus my N stars instead of are our film writers that that they can only come up with this acting was horrible and the characters were for the most part the lead lady in the story had no good 
 i was excited to see a that would hopefully represent indian but i found this show to be not funny at all the producers and cast are probably happy to get both bad and good feed back because as far as they are concerned it 's getting talked about i was ready for some and have no problem with it because exist for a reason they are usually true but there really was n't anything funny about these characters the 
 when you look at the cover and read stuff about it an entirely different type of movie comes to mind than what you get here then again maybe i read the summary for the other movie called instead as there were two movies of this title released about the same time with both featuring that had key elements in common however reading stuff about that movie here i know i saw this one and not that one and that movie 
 like many others i counted on the appearance of dennis to make this not a complete waste of time i was everything negative said about this is more than true what takes the however is the horrible horrible for the main 's why the planet might be destroyed the only way to recover from it for the entire human race to be saved trough it is to get as many smart capable nice competent people into an underground and dennis 
 this movie was on the other day and i did n't enjoy it at all the first george of the was a good comedy but the completely awful the new actor and actress to play the lead roles were n't good at all they should of had the original actor and original actress i her name so this movie gets the N out of ten rating not a film that you can sit down and watch and enjoy this is 
 was a good mystery i i have not read the book despite being an christie fan the is n't without its problems there were times when the and there were attempts to get it right was a little and the events leading up to the final solution were rather rushed i also thought there were some slow moments so some of the mystery felt however i loved how was it had a very similar style to the brilliant abc and 
 one crazy summer is the not necessarily the best movie i have ever when one crazy scene is done another emerges it never lets you rest just one thing after another the is great the are the right ones for the is also a clean movie little that is in course it has the story of the guys you would n't trust with your lunch money taking up a challenge and winning over people with more resources who 'd want 
 gordon lewis reaches a new low even for him with the a ' that all of his technical sound poor lighting and this would be even a bit if the film at least had an interesting plot blood in all its ridiculous glory is a fine example but is a total completely private investigator frank is recruited by a newspaper reporter to find out who 's been you 'll stop who the is long before these two are up the 
 this was absolutely the most pile of to which i have ever born witness not only was the name a complete since the film has next to nothing to do with but the acting is as and as the attempt to actually make some kind of plot when you watch this film you can not help but spend every second questioning when you 've had enough and it 's time to turn it off unfortunately i waited until the end 
 i have never understood the appeal of this show the acting is poor being a notable exception the of most episodes are and the dialogue is weak the jokes and it is painful to try and sit through even half an episode furthermore the link between this show and the ' is extremely beyond the style of dress and the and background used for the show seems to be nothing more than a modern with the same old scripts that 
 mr. goes to town was the last major achievement the studios produced the quality of the series produced at the same time is evident in this extraordinary music and by frank and with assistance by veteran are quite good but not as much as the scoring of the picture by who also scored snow white for disney 's atmospheric music is and a treat for the and staging of the picture was years ahead of it 's time and once 
 this is one of my two or three favorite and undoubtedly 's best performance with the she is good in a number of other but here she is absolutely brilliant her is not funny at all in fact it is downright beautiful but the plot is constructed in such a way that the the humor rather than from it we listen to the of voice of spring no less than three times but it never gets old partly because we 
 this is supposed to be based on collins ' but the only it to that story were the characters ' names the time period and the if they were going to change the story so i do n't understand why they needed to keep up the that it came from collins go read the book it 's much better 
 of all the british movies like four charge of the light for example this movie stands out as the of the crop it reflects a time when the sun never set on the british empire get over it i wo n't go into why because so many others have expressed the many reasons that makes this film great i have visited the alabama hills and have the pass through which the british marched and it remains as it was unchanged 
 james and political ward get to become a deputy commissioner of and visits a boys reform school the catch is that is not in it for the he wants to make a difference in the lives of the kids there because he comes from a background like of the piece is who is a and a to one of the of the plot of the mayor of hell is that these kids are mostly and those that judge them and 
 i loved this film not being a ed wood jr. fan i prefer to appreciate his enthusiasm and acknowledge his his movies are fun but his personal story is one racked with pain i hoped and was to find that this film would be about understanding his life rather than simply him with from beginning to end this film from a into a leaving the cast and the unexpectedly connected to each other and to ed wood we get are 
 having already seen the original jack i never thought that jack N would be as absurd as it is boy was i wrong then again movies have a way of showing bad material even worse than you might expect i believe this is the first and it may be an indication of what to expect in the future more 's hard to watch this without laughing especially during the later parts of the movie in which jack 's which are 
 i had been to this movie for a relationship class in my school as figured it was nothing and nothing new though it tries to be original by focusing on the father instead of the mother showing the problems that the would go through it had an interesting side to it but it just does n't live up to its due to the fact nothing else in this movie was original we have the main character who has the older 
 this movie is full of stock movie murder a mad female scientist with an even father who wears a because of his horrible male and female the victim of some experiment grave mind control up bodies a car crash on a road in the lot all topped off with an awful score and some of the worst foley work ever script is even by badly dubbed spanish movie standards and some of the is just bizarre in one scene where 
 there are times when finishing a film one wishes to have a refund for the time just spent this was one of those times i almost gave up with only N minutes left to endure and i wish i had the pace that a man goes from a controlled life to one of complete and could never be this a celebration to the predictable ending price man of privilege and culture allows himself to be by a woman by violence 
 another film to punish us for the crime of enjoying pulp if you like watching people get killed by machine gun fire for an hour and a half this 'll probably fit the bill fans of the debut episode of the title character literally thousands of seemingly soldiers will really go for it 's not exactly a movie in fact all it is is an excuse for a bunch of young people to act and shoot people sometimes an entire 
 when the come they will not be bearing gifts no they bring with them war war and as any familiar with this episode know it is a of the war film the enemy below from the the obvious difference is that instead of a and a or an american & german engaged in war games it is two in outer space in history about N years before the events here according to this episode earth fought the wars after about 
 this was a movie that i had heard about all my life growing up but had never seen it until a few years ago it 's reputation truly it i knew of michael had seen the saw commercials for all of the that followed but i was growing up during the decade where and had a deadly grip on the game and never thought much of the halloween franchise boy how i was being with cheap knock is a movie 
 let me begin by saying that there is no bigger fan of the original than i. both the book and the adapted from it stand alone in my experience as moving dramatic and works there is no comparison between and any western at least not since the legendary of john ford and john wayne it was with real reservations that i sat down to watch this new what with 's and the missing original cast members after watching the first 
 i was n't really interested in seeing step up but my friend just kept and me to see this film especially since she is so in love with i her constantly about it saying how that 's the only reason why she loved the movie but she somehow convinced me that it was a movie worth seeing that if i loved movies like take the lead and save the last dance that i should love step up what the i 
 i have n't seen i tried to watch it once in the middle of the show but could n't get into it however i saw yesterday i felt a little lost so i decided to watch the pilot today and i must say i was surprised i think this is a promising show and the only side effect it had on me is that now i want to watch as what i really liked is that i did n't have 
 well it turned out as i expected but nothing else added to the original what did surprise me however was that the was fairly drastically changed compared to the N initially this my interest but what eventually surprised was that the new and turns a were apparently invented in order to present us with a typical product and b made the whole the N story was and included no or any of that sort it just stated that when you 
 high was actually a drama with moments of comedy it was a reflection of high school life back in the day i attended high in washington d.c. from N to N and much of what was in high was an every day thing at as a matter of fact after the movie came out everybody started calling high getting high shooting chasing parties and fights that sums up high school life for many in d.c. back in the day i 
 this is a great movie for any fan of hong kong action movies from it 's little plot the weak drama and of comedy the movie is action packed with and arts action kept me from beginning until the end i thought shannon lee was in the an action director like is what keeps hong kong action going strong this modern action film is highly recommended 
 i 'm trying to understand what people liked about i am an film and film maker as i was telling friends during my lunch hour may well be my biggest movie disappointment of the year just like the short the film missed its marks several times during the movie it made attempts at humor it sets you up for the instead of making you it leaves you feeling empty the jokes reminded one of the recent star wars films they 
 loved the film this was my first at both and london both of which are two of my must say that no matter how many times i 've seen this movie i ca n't help but up one of those movies that should become a classic for all

 the mayor of hell has the feel of an early dead end kids film but with a much harder edge and very few light spots preceding the first appearance of the dead by four years james has a full screen opening credit even though technically the ' of the movie 's title is actually portrayed by one of several boys sent to reform school during the opening scenes 's character is smith a young tough who 's by ' and 
 this two-part tv is n't as good as the original from N but it 's solid the original benefited from a huge number of things was all in black and white it had a great jazz score and it was at the real locations including the home of the doomed clutter family that was important because in the book and in the original movie the home is very much a character was in canada which i guess for kansas the 
 the pilot is extremely well done it out how the characters bond in future episodes i do n't think anyone could have created a better pilot for this show it displays remarkable creativity on the writers part although not everything was out because it was the very first episode a lot of events that happen in future seasons were demonstrated in the pilot an example would be ross and future relationship even though the nervousness of a first episode appeared 
 this film is a of a N film they should have let it remain that a bomb douglas displays absolutely no here is to a role as a real and with a what i 'll do to that the ridiculous plot deals with a picture of a woman in a castle in N rome that saved the day by killing a now let 's fast forward to N years later where just married to the count faces a similar situation 
 i have to start off by because i thought the first of this film was it 's mostly because of 's performance spot acting by all involved was quite good but the movie the atmosphere was perfect in all i 'm not a giant fan but this has got to be one of his best roles honest all good words to describe this was reading a previous review and the person said that the behind early 's violence is n't 
 this is burt reynolds ' citizen kane nothing else he was ever involved in came close to approaching 's machine seemed to me that he put everything he had into is a movie that is in love with opening where a of is an exciting piece of everything moves so quickly once it has started to go wrong that it appears to take on a life of its own a achieved effect it looks cold and dangerous on reynolds ' 
 without a doubt one of 's best great special effects and the me baby 
 this must rank as one of 's greatest i was europe at the time and had the to upon the crew making this movie in what was even then one of the world 's i was as an extra and what followed was an exhibition of modern day forget all the accusations you 've ever heard of peter 's on this rare piece of french and his on a level of at the restaurant at that left the 'd in 
 this is a for fans of it 's an earlier work of but his dramatic style is quite in place also those who did n't like might find this release to bit slightly more is rather unique to in that it 's actually based on real science in fact the show has several little science lesson explaining the physics behind some of the events in the movie one of the big dramatic points in the film is the relative passage 
 do n't see this movie bad acting and stupid effects a complete waste of time i was hoping to see a lot of cool and hot instead the director depended on animal to shock you the the are pretty basically one woman he in her mouth one he puts raw on her face and her burger king 's killer new i do n't think this movie relied too much on actual facts i mean he real killer did n't carry 
 i have n't any idea how could regard this as a decent b western or how one said the plot was more than most nothing could be from the truth this movie is one huge it is an to the noble b western films of the 's i have seen many of wayne 's early lone star and republic and this one is easily the bad guy is known as the shadow for out loud initially the shadow 's scheme

 this film was not only one of john ford 's own personal but also numbered directors m. and among its ironically i 've just caught up with it myself via 's recent set after missing out on a couple of original language of it on italian tv many years ago and again a few times on tv while in hollywood the film marked ford 's first of nine with henry and is also a example of ford 's a made 
 this familiar story of an older woman is surprisingly bikers free love and jail mix surprisingly well in this forgotten black-and-white effort lead actress as the candy gives the performance of her career all of N was and in the young graduates N but gives a more serious performance in the the violence and periodic are somewhat surprising but by the director leads and george e. sell the there are enough between the and the young graduates to make one 
 i have to admit that out of the many many movies i have seen this has to be one of the worst i was shocked to discover that this piece of work had a budget when it started i thought that the opening was pretty good fairly standard for this kind of film but pretty good anyway but as the film i began to feel uncomfortable with the lack of pace that i was seeing each seemed to take hours 
 andy and are both in to 's directed crime which puts most western efforts to shame think of it as the hong kong ' only better everything about the film class from the performances to the the to the script the tone remains serious throughout but the film has a nice line in friendship and at it 's heart sure it gets a little later on but it would be a who did n't find something to love about this 
 it could have been a story based on the ancient races of cat people but it work could have been just that and with which kept my fueled the lead characters charles brady played by brian and his mother mary played by alice were done had no of and were hardly or drawing not even who played robertson 's character fit into that however as i 've said many times before when you a stephen king novel for tv you 
 was apparently intended to be a related to serial killer richard there is however not much killing to be found in this movie and none of it is shown the most disturbing scene in the entire movie is perhaps when one of the eight unfortunate nurses to death in her own yet even this is merely implied and not shown save for a few downward of mr. 's leg the most entertaining part of this movie is most likely the 
 funny and spectacular is always you with her and energy it 's obvious that this is a film by the in the script the and the way they touch each other and before there were this is no holds barred fun for everyone i do n't understand the john issue though does it matter whether or not he 's in this film if he is he screen is so short that he 's basically a you need to watch it 
 as an actor i really like independent films but this one is at boys go to vermont for a civil service yet when the plane it flies over a palm tree were the directors aware that palm trees are not in vermont yes no and the same for the service again nice of palm the boys are leaving they apparently could not get a ticket on any major airline since the plane that is is federal express did they ship 
 as much as i love who is really i have to this movie if you ca n't tell who did it and why in the first half hour you obviously have never seen a or have never watched it 's like the and actors did n't care that they way they were shooting it and they way they were playing the characters would be a dead this movie serves to the who like to mix violence and sex not a 
 while william can always make me in anything he appears in and i especially love him as crane in boston legal well this show is all about and and and jumping up and has none of the intelligence of none of the of deal or no show is all about and stupid things to fill in the watched it of course just to check it out i did watch it for over N minutes then i had to turn it 
 there seems to be an overwhelming response to this movie yet no one with the insight to its which is extremely flawed it simply continues to style analysis which is that it plays off of the audiences lack of knowledge and in order to an emotional and of negative N tell the some fact only in order to them into drawing conclusions which are predictable for instance the idea of civil war chaos etc were all supposedly unexpected responses to

 i admit i had some when i first saw the for this film was on ground here i mean harris and do n't really look or even sound like john or paul but i have to admit this film really surprised me it 's far from the film i expected instead it 's a character study a and ultimately look at friendship and the ultimate lesson we all learn it 's hard if not impossible to capture what we once 
 once big action star who fell off the face of the earth ends up in a small town with a problem with drug dealers and a dead body of a federal agent with some former to clean up the key often to the point of action comedy mostly just does n't work part of the problem is the casting chris as a former action hero he 's not bad but he 's really not as some one who was taken 
 this film is just a shame florida seems to becoming a more recognized area like vancouver 's rise to the brothers was shot in central florida and this short film is a bit of a setback for the area which made great with the film walking across africa and the great hbo from earth to the moon will try to be as honest as possible i think was the perfect place to film the brothers it had the potential to

 anyone who complains about peter jackson making movies too long should sit through this cbs event there 's about N minutes of story by N hours of unnecessary featuring tv drama bad science is a for weather disaster movies so i 'm not going to complain about that silly science can be fun to watch if it 's executed in an amusing fashion what this movie is it 's N all of which could be without destroying what is supposed 
 this is pretty much a made for tv type of movie intended to capitalize off of the success of the original i 'm a fan of and this one might have been good had they not attached the name to it because as is the director and plot of the original were better and this movie just about my taste for the entire series the characters are and there are problems with and several outright production the story hardly gets 
 this show seemed to be good is an ok actress and i like police series but somewhere in the production this program went wrong first of all the writers should have more suspects than one you know who did it every time that makes it boring the main character is and its not in any way i know they wanted her to be tough but mean stupid and a bad chief the crimes are and and its just all the 
 had the league been pitching this script the backers would simply have turned around and said no you 're not having the money this is as a fan of the league of this is their poorest to date not particularly funny not particularly entertaining there are few out loud moments they do exist but they are few and far between i felt the format was tired and really dragging the film to the writers being of the characters and it 
 i am a huge fan of the comic book series but this movie fell way below my expectations i expected a heavy metal N feel to it slow moving bad dialogue lots ' blood but this was worse than anything i could have the plot line is almost the same as the comic but the good points pretty much stop there the characters do n't have the energy or spirit that drew my attention in the comic series the movie 
 ride with the directed by lee tiger is another in this fine directors cap for those with the history of the border wars during the american civil war see this film & you will visit a sad piece of besides some action scenes quite bloody at times this is a story of love & between men & one lady in particular it stars jeffrey wright & as the young lady i never heard or seen her before i want to 
 what could 've been a great film about the late pro craze the kid turned into a can tell the were working on a budget everything look on the cheap seemed a bit off to michael from the was also a bad casting choice he looked too old to play the he looked way too healthy for a coke if you look at from the N main event the real was so and he practically had no nose from too 
 plays sue a year old girl who has lost her mother and finds it hard to with her father until one day in the of her apartment she finds a secret magic which takes her to back to the late century were she meets two other children who have lost their father and face poverty i was through the channels and found this i read the and suddenly saw i thought and watched the movie i did n't had done 
 i actually had seen the last parts of this movie when i was a child thanks to the search feature of i was able to find out the name of it for years i did not know the name but the movie stuck in my mind the ending left hope that the main character would get back to earth eventually it was a shame it did not make it to a series this movie me of to the far side 
 woman with who her hair in the middle of the film of presumably does not see what the audience can see from miles away begin alert that her is having an affair with her best girlfriend and they both try get rid of her end of alert and what a that was the title already gives it away does n't it bad acting bad script waste of time oh in the end she lives ever after if you liked this 
 it was N and it martin alone says what to expect of this it was a movie according to the movie had got a good woman and did n't want to real life may have been a innocent or he may have just wanted to manipulate the was or was n't is for history to decide but this was a movie that dealt with at a time when a country was questioning why it was fighting and the movie took 
 i guess every time i see one of these old movies from the N 's it puts me back at a simpler time no matter how they may seem today this movie is a good one i remember seeing it as a small kid and thinking it was the greatest movie ever it has all the characters that a young wants to be now as an adult i can look back and and still feel sad but this time i 
 has played a few heavy parts in her many years on the big screen but she 's mostly known for the light and stuff with allen such as hall she deserves an for best actress in a drama for this effort and it does n't really matter what the competition was the year it was first shown try and find a scene in which she does n't appear and it was all heavy drama in its pace and action all 
 the success of gave birth to a whole new wave i 'm happy with that as a big fan of and i liked most of those new films is a one big pack of fast and original i see this movie more like the opening of a new much like episode N and aliens since it comes up with a new twist instead of focusing on the little relationship we have here a movie about couples we have the sweet 
 despite unfortunately thinking itself to be a b important and c interesting fortunately this movie is over quickly the script makes little sense the whole idea of the relationship between the two main characters is and john shows us all in the space of one movie why he should never have let himself out of music his performance is and only positive thing to be said is that manages to deliver a good turn his later bad would show just 
 was not my favorite type of movie i found it overly and the acting was below par and were good but some of the other actors were n't at all i also did not believe that paul 's parents would go away and leave him with the family especially when they had a living in the home their social classes were too far apart to consider this it seemed the 's was too there was a scene in the beginning 
 first things first this is n't an action movie although there is a lot of action in it i think you can compare it to american sports movies where a team of very bad players succeed in the winning a game or beyond expectation in this case it is n't about football or baseball but in the beginning these street seem to be good for nothing but soon we will find out that they do n't want to be and 
 in my review just submitted i referred to the young actress lead as when it should have been i was so involved with character and the action i guess that i was n't that concerned with names anyway she and the film are brilliant as i said the and the director 's use of are worthy of and his ' the production design is top the placement of actors in the middle ground and background within any given en scene 
 i went to see this movie today with hopes that it would involve an at least story i was extremely disappointed as it did not the plot and the decisions by the main character were so i was hoping for a dog day afternoon movie but instead got something totally i actually found myself totally hoping for the hero to be knocked off and i nearly walked out of the theater on several occasions when this should have happened but 
 the only previous gordon film i had watched was the the magic N though i followed this soon after with empire of the N he seems to be best remembered however for his work of the i happened upon this one in a rental shop had n't i noticed ' figure on the i probably would n't even have bothered with it since i know the film under its original title i 'd seen a still from it on an 
 this is a very dark movie somewhat better than the average film it was a lot better than i thought it would be is a combination of a psychological and a film the voice on the telephone is really this voice without a face this unknown and threatening voice works really well in the film since we never see the killer face is left to the of the action and never and after the first half of the film it 
 based on the true story about christopher hutton and lee penn and their involvement in selling american secret government documents to the soviets during the works for the government and his job is to guard these particular documents which ultimately him about his country 's affairs and practices he then his friend lee who has become a wanted man to be the for these sensitive documents lee the russian embassy in mexico and makes contact with alex and they both 
 many things become clear when watching this film N the acting is terrible tom and wendy are but the conflict borders soap the other two boys an overly child and your N the film as a whole is and disappointing N 's dreams and episodes are disturbing acted by tom N the of the beginning love is an odd choice we are all special friends N the weird lines and side are not made any better by the terrible acting 
 i thought this movie was highly the subject matter does seem like it would be a little strange and i was put off at first but once i was watching the movie it did n't seem strange at all i was with all the different possibilities that the story had to offer and i could n't wait to find out how it would end once it did end i thought about it for a long time after i was pleased 
 i found this early difficult to watch and i 'm a fan it 's not her fault but the production values of this film would cause any to become N of the movie is with medium shots and it 's very similar to watching a play 
 the good thing about this film is that it stands alone you do n't have to have seen the original unfortunately this is also it 's biggest it would have been nice to have included a few of the original characters in the new story and seen how their lives had developed as in the original is excellent and provides the films best comic moments as he attempts to deal with and embarrassing situations but the supporting cast is not 
 cutting to the chase this is one of the most amazing most intense film i 've seen in a long time the first movie in years that left me absolutely i could barely feel my way out of the theatre i was so 've been at the screen for about minutes trying to find some way to describe the power of this film and just failing any one aspect of it the video format the portrayal of the events the 
 this is definitely one of the better brooks movies along with although i will openly admit to not having watched many others at least yet it 's very silly and funny there are hardly more than a few minutes throughout the entire two hour where you are n't almost all of the have a great effect few of them fall flat i saw this movie right after seeing and reviewing spy hard and these two movies i realize exactly of 
 still a for 's sense i liked this movie though the ending was a as usual develops a sense of and long 's fights are extremely impressive this has the feel it was done for the big screen 
 this is a beautiful film the true tale of bond between father and son this is by far tom at his tom is really out of the box in this movie he usually has the nice guy roles yet in this film he comes off in this film as a bit but still emerges like a rose even until the very last scene the assassination of his character the cast of this movie was well put together i also love 
 turned out to be another failed attempt by the channel i am not sure who wrote the script and interpreted the but i am sure it was by some N year old who thought it would be to a have a in the movie when i saw that part i lost all hope then they set off for in a what looks to be the ship that christopher columbus in when they reach which is supposed to be a mead 
 it 's quite simple that those who call this movie anything below decent do not know their the master creates a sense of and rarely seen in movies outside of of a of and rolled into one and this is what its all rate acting first rate direction first rate sets and is right up there with the best of asian dark water and a tale of two must take it from a guy who knows his movies 
 interesting story and sympathetic treatment of racial discrimination son of the is rather too long and contains some acting but on the whole remains a about a chinese passing as white starts as leaves college after being by a of he on a world tour to discover himself and ends up as secretary to a british playwright king in monte he meets beautiful bennett and they fall in love but when she he is chinese she goes in a by 
 this movie is my all time favorite movie it has great acting guys and a great plot is great in this movie it has funny moments sad moments and happy moments who could ask for anything more this movie is great 
 i found this film embarrassing to watch i felt like it was the down my as if i could n't pick up the i needed a voice over to them all out for me a father who is still an i did n't really feel it was a film about as such true are very people inside in my opinion of course they find it hard to something that the main character had no problem with really except he did 
 this took me back to my in the N 's so but just no one ever could play gordon like larry just great i have two more series to view gordon 's trip to and gordon the universe can not wait 
 this film from its direction grant and its incompetent lead steve who 's putting a solid effort to win a bruce contest the writing is reckless hollywood action whose one of my david fraser and kim coates give a decent performance the film is definitely below average N out of N i wonder what hollywood studios thought actually giving the go ahead to weak director such as grant and i 'd say to what were you thinking even considering participating 
 some people do n't like the personally i think the was quite remarkable given when this movie was done there are lots of older that i just love my problems with this movie are not the but basically the way it was constructed the characters are all just well and for this movie they should n't be apparently everyone in has a problem for just the way they acted in general me my two and i were laughing through most 
 marked the first of a series of involving james stewart and director anthony as in most of them stewart 's hero has an violent edge that threatens to at any time the title to a one in a thousand that is up for competition at a shoot held in dodge city on july N into town comes lin stewart and his high mitchell who are on the trail of dutch henry brown stephen for a past they arrive just in 
 this is basically a comedy with somewhat odd due to some dramatic elements for michael j. fox and paul it was their first film fox had previously been in a short lived tv series and a tv movie the movie is basically a hunt type movie like run it 's a mad mad mad mad world or more recently race there are no main characters instead there are groups of characters splitting the screen time and allowing for tons of 
 if you 're a fan of and middle eastern music you 're in great luck this film is a of current music in the traditional to the modern it 's very good you could not do better if you went to yourself we get interviews with concert of modern musical a road show with a audience surprisingly very very good and much much more some of the best female i 've ever heard a woman in a steam who will

 the best way to have fun in this movie is to count how many it is chinese a female a that happens to be big enough to fit a big male shooting through the wall to kill the bad guy a situation where you need to out some innocent people to prevent independence day scenes where you out some in a the vice president in a nice well room surrounded by subordinates while the chinese premier virtually alone in a 
 i went to see with high hopes because the director 's had impressed me so despite a few into ranks high on my list of favorite movies for its insight into family relationships and its generally acting and direction and i 've seen it at least three times fell flat in my it seemed a exercise and i was quickly so tired of the main character 's that i was for the movie to end i admit to falling six 
 this is n't the robin williams nor is it the robin williams of recent fame this is a hybrid of the classic drama without mixed with robin 's new love of the but this is n't a per this is more a vehicle through which williams attempts to a sick boy and his oh and this drama plays pretty much like a news report until william 's character gets close to his must say that i was highly though this 
 this is one of the century 's best ever with all the great story and a cast of absolutely actors and love and that really gets you involved and in front of your tv if you have seen it once you will go back to see it again i have several times and still do it the N century 's best drama 
 yes is one of those bad movies that almost one of everything that is wrong with not just kids movies but with here we have as a yes a where he does everything from making bad to in ridiculous all ending in him in a pose with lots of light surrounding him so expect really including the first wish being a lot of junk food falling down from the sky and not knocking out the two main characters particularly the 
 the film is very complete in what it is keeping one interested with the to and growing up with such a bizarre father and it with the of serial murder one simply can not go wrong the very plot in itself the very story and of the film is entertaining it is the sort of story that the director bill could do so much with and in this case he really did do a lot with beginning to end you 
 i agree with who said that there is a lot going on between the lines in this film while i do think the of this film could be improved i do think that the of the relationships between the characters is pierre is going to his even though his love for her seems very pierre and his have a rather and seem to have a relationship and the actual points to the are not quite certain 's brother is a 
 another of my into the bargain this movie gave me exactly what i expected a load of complete with all started so well i liked the little with the about the young couple being exposed to a nuclear blast and was totally absorbed right up until the first person caught fire from then the film into outright and at times became almost embarrassing to watch when the turned out to have been with the same condition as the main character 
 can only be described as awful it is bad to start with and then gets even more bad when you start you really have to watch it through because it is impossible to believe that it can get worse but fear not because it does another poorly written script for a director for of past movie stars it 's hard to decide if the script is worse than the acting or whether the is worse than both as for the 
 i thought that this film was very i watched this film with my wife before i had my first child therefore i was not watching it as simply family entertainment and i still enjoyed it it seems as though many of the reviews are pointing out that this movie is not earth there were no unexpected plot changes and that the movie was predictable and boring if these people were watching this movie expecting to have a experience doing so 
 now before people start having a breakdown about this movie those who play anyway this is a film it 's been given the hollywood treatment to people and therefore those who play myself included are naturally pick in the of the game in the film it is a decent film and bring to the attention the and ideas behind the game of film is based on a real team a real coach and his work helping guide kids in the 
 your mind will not be satisfied by this but who 's will a couple spends the actual end of the world in the hidden laboratory of some aliens as church end of the world has the and the lack of both and style of the similar movies and it 's not only that but plays like a only but as well the of the movie is a character wholly seems a piece of that significantly which looks today so anyway 
 engaging entry from europe about fighter pilots flying for the during it 's always interesting as an american to see a new point of view on familiar events in history there 's nothing original or revolutionary about the style in which this is or the romantic love that the still it is compelling all the way through there is a good balance between drama humor action and that is by the director and cast this is a breath of fresh 
 to be honest fellow i enjoyed this show a lot the reason well it did n't try to be more than it is i mean a with regular expectations with a well known and repeated plot funny and actors and jokes for a post college is what grown ups is all about trying to be mature but in a funny white is funny as always and some and sex jokes the humor is very N 's without taking in account 
 i am really surprised that this film only has a rating of as of the time i did this review while not exactly a great film i do think it 's one of the best films did and it 's a shame it is n't more highly regarded i think a lot of the reason i liked the film so much is that the usual silly as the is n't present and her role required her to actually act i 
 the late shift is a great book i read the book several years ago and i was at the that went on when carson retired and jay and carson tried to grab his spot when the movie came out i a copy of the movie and having the book recently it 's hard to say which i enjoy more because they 're quite equal in the amount of information the two lead actors john michael and daniel roebuck two actors 
 this movie is a terrible waste of time although it is only an hour and a half long it feels somewhere close to i have never seen a movie move so slowly and so without a purpose this is also a film that takes place a lot of the time during my friend and i an amount of times when we were probably supposed to be only thing we want to know is why such a terrible movie was released

 so when a friend of mine told me he was supposed to direct and i thought i got to check out monster man and see what its like maybe i can get a part in it but when i it into my player and and tried to down the first N minutes of nothing but bad bad i mean bad comedy from that fat thinking he 's funny not to mention how the director spent on the desert road trip 
 first a little summary this reporter named is basically trying to get out the story of a and finds the military & government him nice message government censorship and all that but the way they did the movie was well let me movie is beyond the idea that somebody holds it in higher regard than anything by george is enough for the to be committed to a mental institution the script is on its own like it was written by 
 saw this last night and being a fan of the first i had hoped that the would have the same fun spirit of it 's predecessor this is unfortunately not the case the is similar as the first in which a of burst forth into reality by being released from a movie being played the first had been a movie theater this one takes place in an apartment building and on tv once the are released and mass that 's 
 having seen the movie years ago and been disappointed by its potential when i heard that it was becoming a tv series i refused to watch it my best friend became a fan immediately and knowing my love for movies could not believe that i would n't watch a single episode i told him that the movie had me for life as far as anything was concerned and he told me to forget that the movie even existed he insisted

 i just got done watching on showtime for the fourth time since i first saw it back in july of you would think that with the recent wave of serial killer films that would be some of the earlier films worthy of mention but has n't perhaps if this film had been released sometime between like maybe it might have been more successful in my opinion is much different from most serial killer films released during the late it has 
 i thought this movie was good i loved the plot i loved the shoot out scenes except for a few they were not needed and i also enjoyed 's character she was a rider i liked that i do have to say that in this movie the actors were picked well because sometimes some actors just do n't fit the role however though i hate to say it but i the ending i felt as if it should have went 
 just saw the movie this past weekend i am upset and disappointed with it basically the movie tells you that the ones from former soviet union especially come to this country bring everyone they can with them from the old country and and take over what americans have been working for which is a very wrong way of looking at and a much worse way of telling people about it that 's the main thing another thing the overall writing 
 this is one of the best episodes of doctor who ever we have the the conversion units may scare young children and of the doctor doing one of his best acts david good scenes as if it was a movie with scenes in some streets an on the 's base and leaving the world different to basically a N minute part N of rise of the this would never with it having a great build up to the doctor plus

 let 's face it lot 's of bad movies are made all the time for those people who work in film you have probably poured a lot of time and effort into many of these plot less sometimes and this is my opinion it is the act of merely making the movie that is important to us to tell a story no matter how simple and also the process is one key characteristic that is unique to film and theater 
 the movie is complete disaster i do n't know who write scripts for movies like this one but i would definitely love to meet one of them and talk to him a little bit perhaps script writers really do n't know about situation in foreign countries in present or recent past or they just do n't give a damn and write everything that they think it 's great and formula with mad dictator N hero an american of course might 
 i 'm afraid that you 'll find that the huge majority of people who rate this movie as a N are highly christian i am not if you are looking for a christian movie i recommend this film if you are looking for a good general movie i 'm afraid you 'll need to go was by the characters and their the of the movie is that the teaching of without teaching that it was who is the basis of 
 this was a movie with a whole and too many to count i only watched this movie because one of my favorite actors ron made a in it and i continued watching it because as a girl i love any movie that includes male for a change later i found myself wondering just how much more ridiculous the could get and each time it got more chris l. whom i 've never seen before but loved his little scene is

 i just came back from a of this excellent film it 's style is definitively unique and very well made it is with actual actors but transformed into a black and white style you have never seen before it goes one step further than city and it does it well it 's a successful combination of french comic and movie the story and mood of and if you liked that one you will surely like this one too the is 
 a movie is being shot and things are n't going well it 's about a killer the director tells off the killer in front of the cast and crew he goes crazy and two people he 's killed himself and the film is never finished twelve years later a bunch of film students decide to try and finish it but there 's a people who try and finish it are killed themselves the students ignore that guess what happens next 
 my guide for the quality of the a movie is if i 'm still thinking about it after leaving the theater i 'm still thinking about this one the next day which does n't happen a reasonable guess for century italy lighting are all excellent it is a beautiful film can never rise above the script they must but these actors made the most of their material which is excellent this is one of shakespeare 's best plays which people 
 there are moments in the film that are so your teeth but knowing that there were only weeks left before the code made movies and paramount rushed this into production before and went out of style is so that it 's delicious as women are displayed with price that would a bronx hooker they emerge from in of of the law so stupid they can not find the door get to look up their and chorus sit in giant could 
 i should have known i was in trouble with van as the lead character words can not describe nor do they do justice to just how terrible this movie was but please allow me to try to describe it horrible acting terrible situations and through it all you get the feeling that you are being the and from the trinity broadcasting network its a weak attempt at trying to show hollywood that a movie can be entertaining and have a 
 unfortunately for myself i onto this show late in it 's lifetime i only caught a few episodes about three before it was by abc i loved the characters and but most of all the great actors i was a fan of sex and the city so i saw two characters i recognized was & the character was smith as well as jay from 's way rise to power and i enjoy watching young actors get their due and felt 
 i really like this series its funny and unique style of off the wall sometimes controversial comedy is a fresh take on the it is a it stands out due to the what could be aspect has a comedy turn and the show really is very good my part of the program is the rather odd comments of the father dave his break the program up and allow a really good flow not perfect because sometimes the comedy is n't 
 to begin with i really love her tv show still makes me she was one of the greatest who ever lived right up there with and but her performance in this movie is disappointing she was too old and the filters on the lens make her look like a london she could n't and her voice was so that she through every song her days were long in the past just because you are a fan do n't over this 
 as a of the in art and film i was pleased to discover this film on it is definitely a most of the other reviews tell the general plot not all correct so i wo n't bother to anyone with that the main thing is the concept which is brought on by ana 's impending illness and the way she manages to link with someone else after being so alone and finally with her family which i believe is still 
 this small john ford western with no ' but a cast of character actors is one of his it has a feel to it as it the west of a party of and it may be the most looking of all ford 's films it 's on par with the sun bright which he made a couple of years later is a plot of sorts a group of bank join the train at one point but the film 's dramatic 
 this early film has its flaws a predictable plot and some scenes of dubious but it already clearly demonstrates 's of and the use of powerful images it 's also among the most of his films note for examples the weird he uses during the party and the frequent of both title and plot in the core though remains the final match which is still among the more exciting examples of even though you know that the hero has to 
 i why i did n't like sue got married more than i did when it first came out in N with all the somehow i found 's character way then the plot did n't seem to make sense then by the end of the credits the question came to mind what point was this movie making what was it saying the answer unfortunately was not much if anything i really do n't think this movie aimed at making a statement 
 i used to love the the movie the great and the take manhattan were good family movies written and fun to watch i never thought i would see the day when they would jump on the hollywood but here it is as a making and comments every five minutes this is not your father 's it 's not jim 's anymore it 's a wonderful life movie has its moments but not enough to save it i while watching this 
 this was obviously the prototype for but of barry is i was throughout and out loud plenty of times central performance by barry in the title role an australian who england to upset the with his ways few will be upset by barry 's frequently on his hosts the between the two countries is but friendly and this is by the film 's final line delivered by a somewhat reluctant as he boards the plane home i was just starting

 it is a shame that a movie with such a good as this one had no plot to be supported by the work of and film and above all no sense of what goes on in mexico city the movie tries to be a very realistic of life in city but it is unable to do it it is a shame a lot of film wasted an american woman tries to find her brother who has been the first account 
 i am pretty surprised to see that this movie earned even reviews i found this movie downright awful the plot around trying to decide if it is a comedy or a then it can not achieve either so it throws in the towel and continues with its absurd plot with a scene with an injection and coffee that leaves the audience in their seats looking at one another like is this for real basically it is and really disappointing for 
 i loved this movie because phillips can really fight i always hate when actors are not in action parts it was great to see no but a woman who can perform arts and fighting if you compare this with most action movies with you will definitely see what i mean they do n't have to cut up the shots with someone that can fight and it flows better i was very impressed i hope there 's more 
 michael might have tried to make a larger than life character to a successful degree but the whole and character 's around him where not or interesting at all it was all very boring and somewhat predictable martin a favorite actor of mine had a nothing was michael got a bit after a while and the film could n't decide if it was a comedy or a serious tries hard and good on him but i felt the direction and 
 this is one of the rare movies that i did not immediately discuss with my friends after watching it this was n't because it had particularly or impressed me the contrary it had given me nothing at because somehow everything was so much that i could n't take this film seriously anymore there was so much sex and violence that i got the strong impression that the film was trying very very hard to be offensive as if it was 
 although the of someone focusing on this comment among the other for this movie is low i feel that i have to say something about this one i am not the kind of who pays attention to production value or brilliant acting & however i claim that this movie i do n't know why i do n't like it i mean it has almost everything i want out of a movie blood humor etc according to this evidence it should 
 i was so looking forward to seeing this film that i ca n't really understand how i got the impression i would enjoy it i 'm afraid it really is a every single in the i attended and frequently during the whole film this is a shame because it is a story i 'm inclined to think that it would make a better read it is not helped by the principle character only showing his teeth once and that was 
 one of the more aspects of asian or indeed most anything done outside these united states are the that crop up in war two japanese for instance are to be found a endless variety of subjects many of them handled in fashion the same thing happens in as well though again i 'm referring to movies made outside the $ where we 're just too sophisticated in our to appreciate anything that is n't about or by us would an 
 first of all i loved bruce 's music score very and this alone added to the film 's the best aspect of the movie were the three animals voiced by michael field and the late don fox has the lines plays a rather otherwise engaging character the voice of reason and field adds into a character that is always seen telling chance off the humans were n't as engaging and sometimes the film dragged but that is my only complaint 
 while john seems to get the bulk of attention the true star of four daughters is lane her performance is the that holds the large cast ability to equally well with john and the more jeffrey lynn is at the core of the success of four daughters 
 a beautiful piece of children 's buried in a world of setting the story around the famous book of believed to have been by from the small island of off the western coast of the tale of a young who goes off into the forest in search of the fierce of in hopes of recovering a lost films true beauty lies in its ' cell in a bright and style of deep resulting in a look of seem less much 
 this is a really great film in the pulp with a touch of film thrown in truly one of thompson 's best performances to date this film has everything it 's well written well directed films and has some great performances i do n't know why it did n't catch on it 's spectacular 
 not a terrible movie but there are monster scenes where you will be rolling on the floor laughing not a good thing for a the acting is generally pretty decent for a channel movie barry plays a credible us senator and diamond phillips again gives us a decent figure the special effects are well special for example the external train shots are very obviously a model a strikes a car in the opening scene the car bursts into but does 
 police story is one of the best works by the master of action to other action films police story makes and look like scenes are well and the action scenes are new line has any sense they would release this in theaters 
 the first episode of to man with dean ' that just aired was at least up to with most episodes of 's ' and had me at my hope it keeps up the good work of ' on my tv richard is one of the best in the new breed of alternative comedy i hate this phrase but am too too think of another one on tv 'm glad that on a trip of local retailers today 's was sold 
 if you were n't there then unfortunately this movie will be beyond for you which as i say is a shame because although some of the acting is it is meant to be for let 's face it in real life we do n't say things in an or perfect way even when we mean to in this sense it works this however does not apply to our known actors in this film notably foster born a natural the fact 
 not too keen on this really the story is pretty and i enjoyed the first N minutes bill good after that it was pretty tim does n't fit the role he comes across as a inflated & taylor is entirely as a player it 's a film and as a feel slightly after watching it there 's no scenes of N or playing with his fellow band he 's completely i find it hard to build any relationship with this 
 i saw this on a cheap release with the title the entity force since i enjoy N 's films i thought i was in for a real treat the film is mostly boring and you 're constantly waiting for something to happen it does eventually get somewhat interesting but this is in the last quarter of the film it 's a case of too little too late when the action does happen it 's not that great what we get 
 wrote and directed this little of a film based on the concept that the aids virus was a sheep virus by the government to rid the world of and was apparently tested on in the years before the of the disease were it not for the of the concept of the film this would fall into the category of the many films about the of the world by a rampant tom from berlin to san francisco to investigate his father 
 seeing as plays my favorite character in the history of tv it was a conclusion i was go to the movies and spend $ N on this i also think this applies to movie around a that a secret service agent is planning to the president as the investigation it seems the only likely candidate is the highly pete michael douglas pete goes on the fun style to search for the 's solid but certainly not spectacular a decent cast 
 the N is a name very few are familiar with her bright career as a director only lasted a single decade ended abruptly by a car accident despite her short career she however managed to create some of the best soviet films of her time her last film the is widely regarded as one of the soviet films of the nevertheless her work remained in throughout the years that followed usually only available on rare and poor copies on video 
 directed a little known nasty ' in N called the and since then has gone on to have a hand in a handful of feature films including the N movie the his latest feature film little things boasts a plot that sounds decent as well as a looking that i seem to remember a couple of years ago in to a film that was meant to direct well i guess he felt that this one was too similar to his 
 i could n't agree more with the other comment it 's like falling down peter is ok and william hurt great as always except in lost in space this is a good movie with pretty good performances very if you like falling down you 're going to enjoy this one N of N 
 this film is available from david and on the before hollywood there was fort lee although that is a version with just the movie sections i 'm not sure if films only had a film print of these parts or they out the other scenes the original version was a movie the complete feature does survive but the for this version had some and a couple of sections looked bad so that may be why 's version was by maurice 
 i recently this movie as part of a phase i 'm going through i was born in N and so film from to has quite an important place in my growing particular movie was one of my and so i was when it became available in the it has n't become worse with time it is still a great fun film with plenty of excitement in its own way sure it in the shadow of bigger larger budget films but 
 i have always been a great of and is one of my favorite films this is a film version of stage play and while most of the film takes place in a hotel room it still has some of very unique story is about a famous actress russell who after a hard nights work on a film in N goes to a hotel to visit a famous professor michael and together in his hotel room they talk after she wants 
 one of the best memories of my should be on it captured everything we grew up with in the peace power and great music the two hosts carol and were the definitive with long hair peasant and bell they looked like a ross the graduate and love story respectively they made us happy with jokes from the gave us on being nice through conversations with the garden and us with music from their they were the best and carol was 
 do n't bother a little could go a long way but all we get is pure particularly from the plot is one of those car episodes the vehicle into another and everything changes direction again until we are merely our heads wondering if there were ever a plot phillips is actually good but it 's hard playing across from a playing lady lost in the 's brother 's duck soup the now there 's an actor and there is the 
 well i have to agree with the critics on this one who all said leave it alone why they had to make this of the N i do n't know my guess is they wanted to reach a new audience and thought color and actors were the answer since those were the main changes the was the same and the story the one hand i them for not making this over with a lot of and and making it a 
 this film lacked something i could n't put my finger on at first on the part of the leading actress this inevitably translated to lack of chemistry when she shared the screen with her leading man even the romantic scenes came across as being merely the actors at play it could very well have been the director who what he needed from the actors i just do n't could it have been the just exactly who was the in love 
 i have seen this film only the one time about N years ago and to this day i have always told people it is probably the best film i have ever seen considering there was no dialogue and only thought dialogue i found the film to be and i even found myself holding my breath so as not to make any sound i would highly this film i wish it was available on 
 i have n't read a of lincoln so maybe this was an accurate portrayal and maybe it 's because i 'm used to the equally and that lincoln as brilliant and the of our country but why would they make a movie representing lincoln as a while henry made an excellent lincoln his portrayal of him as an i 'm just a simple guy seemed a little granted that was jr. 's whole campaign to make us think he was 
 N is a made film that takes small carefully positioned steps its ending that need to be in order to be enjoyed from the to the tightly world that the hero we are taken by the director and controlled from the very moment we enter the hotel we like the hero will never escape from the intensity and of his driven mafia world that the film mafia in them makes it all the more successful the concrete grave the inevitable 
 want a great for failure take a s plot add in some weak completely undeveloped characters and than throw in the worst special effects a movie has known let for a week the amount of time probably spent making this trash the result is a movie that takes bad movies to dangerous and low movie utterly my words can not convey how painful it was to watch this is not one of those bad movies that you and your friends 
 i ca n't believe i am just now seeing this film i think perhaps i thought it was another movie about being and i avoided roots for the same reason just as i have yet to see 's list i do n't want to be by other peoples ' pain not matter how or it is supposed to i guess the main thing i noticed about the color was that it was not about black people being by whites the 
 this movie is well made it is beautiful and it is it is great and again it shows how great peter is he is and he even gets better the older he gets you peter you very much for this of a movie this movie there is lot of wisdom in this movie there is lot of humor in this movie there is life in this movie and meaning this movie shows how life can is in that movie he 
 every once in i 'll remember that i 've actually seen this bizarre that 's a cross between whatever happened to baby the turner movie the big and the which also took place in N but maybe before this so-called movie was made there are some of the plot already here so i wo n't go into it but it 's worth noting that hopkins plays a of herself a actress perhaps she thought she was making a movie that 
 is not a it 's a who do it to who first it 's so hard to describe this movie without giving anything away so i wo n't mention anything more about the plot as far as acting goes it is greatest role as clifford a young you really see the range in his acting in this movie from to downright clifford is such a hard role to play and in the stage production of this i have never seen 
 this thing takes the very poorly respected to begin with and completely it down the toilet the only people i would even consider recommending it to are for a scene in a boys ' room and in the end i would n't make such a recommendation to do so would be to contribute to the of a an piece of garbage with utterly no 
 one of the films ever made why it only got a rating is a mystery this film is a window into the world of the black experience in america should be mandatory for all white people and all children above age i recommend watching it with the long walk home as a companion piece if you think goldberg 's work is about homer and eddie or hollywood think again do n't miss this movie which should have won the and 
 five star final was one of the best films of the early it edward g. robinson and was a very story about a newspaper and their willingness to do anything anything to sell newspapers in particular an old story of an innocent woman is across the pages and helps to destroy her now happy life many years after she was involved in a scandal the reason i loved the film so much was that it was and pulled no showing 
 i can not remember a more mind and film in other words a real of the worst kind how can anyone watch this film and recommend it to others only if they do n't like admitting they made a mistake it seems to the worst of female aspirations no real substance to it all happy and that 'll please the well not this member of the what a load of i wanted to leave the within N minutes of the 
 what do you do if you 're coming off of a blockbuster film like ' with some skeptical critics still with your performance or convinced by your strong screen presence and acting skills what do you do go home sit down and no if you 're you sign yourself up for the next strong period piece that comes along and continue to prove yourself worthy of all the great scripts and equally great roles and that 's just what she 
 this movie could have been oh so much better it is a beautiful story set in very trying times and yet it was so poorly executed the leading actors have in the past done excellent jobs and for the most part they do an adequate job in this film although at times their dialogue seems and forced the could have been more the bulk of the criticism should go to the writers who took a good story and made it 
 i 'm sitting around going through movie listings and not really seeing anything i want to see my appetite keeps saying something like broadcast news that 's what i want something smart and funny with adult ideas and great acting and writing and a style that does n't call attention to itself this may well be hurt 's best performance is this or the big to my mind however hurt is smart and to play an person without making sure 
 my first review of this movie was so negative that it was not i will try to tone this one down lets be real no one wants to see a chuck movie where he is not the main was a good fight scene at the end but the rest of the movie i have to wonder if old chuck just ca n't hang with the best any more has he slowed down so much that he has to turn out 
 this movie features a pretty decent of an earthquake for the reason you have n't seen it is because audiences in the were of the macdonald picture in which the star her way through while came to a complete standstill the cross time very well macdonald 's do not and the of said to show off her only typical talent is not good the device of two friends growing up to become a and a is given another run through 
 we 're a long way from once again directs stars as a police named mark and gene is the beautiful woman who haunts him but nothing else about where the sidewalk ends resembles everyone 's favorite sophisticated murder mystery instead of dialogue we get while the earlier film took place in the upper of new york society here we 're in the district of dark streets cheap restaurants and as ever now works as a department-store and lives in washington 
 i do n't care what some of the reviews said this movie was funny the thing with this film is that you ca n't expect anything else except to be this is not some intellectual comedy this is a movie the three main cast members are great and work very well with each other is a in the supporting cast as himself a former tv brought in by 's character to coach the on how to be tv those are 
 very but structured and ultimately very a nice very look at a small florida beach town in the dead of winter i 've been there and this is absolutely 's also the debut feature of actress and she makes a big impression here it 's hard to believe this film is N years old i remember seeing it in theaters and i recently again except for the N 's looking clothes it has held up very is so and here 
 anyone with a young boy in the house who wo n't watch black & white movies should put this on their television set when the child walks by wondering what all the on screen shouting and shooting 's about tell him this is a picture for adults and that he is n't big enough to watch it yet that 'll hold him there for a few minutes director george stevens and his team will keep him to the think my 
 it 's not surprising that the majority of votes were submitted by aged this is the in women 's lives when they become the of aged and ill parents i lost my mother from of cancer in june and went through most of the same portrayed by in this film yes it made me cry but the were real the characters were real and the plot development extremely accurate to the entire cast and crew for a wonderful portrayal of 
 stay the hell away from this one no really i 'm serious i know you might think this is a fun hong kong action style b movie i did but trust me it 's not in fact the only thing accurate about that would be the words hong kong and then only used in a strictly yen has it chan has a the guy from storm riders plays the lead it got it should be good or at least fun 
 i first heard of this film when talked about it on his and cd he said it was a lost classic that is completely ridiculous being a of terrible i knew i was in for a film is hands down one of the i 've ever seen certainly one of the films basically a took human form years ago for a woman the woman died or something the blood the blood fell on the bed the bed is now and 
 i have been a star fan since still am one thing i learned from star is that the special effects are secondary to the characters at fails in its directed written acted d.c. really this one this episode is so embarrassing the master tape should be first half of the first season did n't fare much better 
 so so special effects get in the way of the interesting relationship between uncle martin and tim that we remember from the tv series and what was with the suit 
 was this based on a a a drawing by a N there is nothing in this movie to be taken seriously at all not the characters not the not the plot not the action nothing we have high-tech international who like kids 's resilience weather so that it 's sometimes almost and so on even the that the bad guys use is a film that through some good and a nice setting oh yes and the film opens with some 
 perhaps i 'm being too generous when i give this film two and a half stars out of five but there was an moment however as an american movie this one is a missed chance there are no real plot connections to the superior original to speak of but the story is similar in some ways to london possible warning american kids go to foreign country one falls in love with a beautiful girl another one of the kids gets 
 i started watching this movie expecting some barely film and i was n't far off there 's a fair amount of and they threw in lots of but the latter half of the movie presents a few ironic they actually put a little thought into the story and did n't completely fall into the predictable stuff one expected at the outset and i say it some of the was n't so after all because it fit in with the story 
 is part of a new wave of japanese taking very creative directors editors and and working on historic themes what the japanese call period pieces is extremely creative in terms of color photography and brilliant even the new wave of japanese films allows a at traditional in and powers that were certainly a part of their ancient culture but not really in 's or the series another fine example of this is N i would place director as one of 
 happened upon a copy of this not mine and if i had spent my own money on this i 'd be finding those responsible and demanding it back all i can say is this would be a terrible student film any understanding of the medium of film is acting is god awful the story would have been rejected from the original zone series as and and the change in tone of the lead character 's reaction to the ' is 
 whoever this piece of with a title like deserves some kind of award there are dozens of here like who such a dire project who funded it who cast it who persuaded to share even one scene with jones and so on the most voice connected to the whole belongs to the person who decided very very that this was and not even good enough to go straight to which throws up yet one more why if we rule out 
 in out that seems to be in a a who can take it and it out with equal abandon i 'm not a fan of japanese monster films but wound up committed to all the on the film collection put out by mill films it 's a great value at about five so at cents per movie it really down to an investment in time to watch some of the is from a centuries long by a nuclear blast and

 george of the fame he made both the european original and the hollywood directed he should n't really be blamed for this confused poor movie because all the problems lie in script it 's ill focused and written for instance the killer hangs around a waiting to pick up a victim any victim and starts talking to a girl cut to the next scene where she tells the i 've told you everything about myself tell me about your life 
 i really liked the movie thought it was very entertaining as well as dramatic but i just had a question about the music is the movie i have n't been able to find any kind of if there even is one and specifically i was wondering if anyone could tell me the name of the song that is playing while the boys are going down the river on their way to new orleans i thought it was something along the 
 i 've seen professional reviews claiming roberts playing herself was and very funny i think not an actress playing herself and doing it with her same usual whenever she tries comedy talk about at it 's why does n't she just stand there and go me me me look at me the director and writer should be shot for not thinking of something better then this in what could have been a and by the way steven when the audience

 my wife and i took our N year old son to see this film and were absolutely with the fun of the film it has extra appeal to boys and men who remember their but even women enjoy the film and especially kate 's boys are so weird it 's to see a film that shows that boys and are indeed different in their emotional and social makeup boys really do these kinds of strange things and usually survive to 
 and this movie has crossed it i have never seen such a terrible movie in my life i mean a kid 's head getting cut off from the force of an empty a with a that has the clearly visible this was a excuse for a movie 
 it 's amazing that so many people that i know have n't seen this little everybody i have turned on to it have come back with the same reaction what a great movie i 've never much for though his turns in N and fight club show improvement but his performance in this film as a is dark and right on else in the film gives excellent performances and the movie 's slow and greatly enhance the proceedings the sense 
 and you 'd be right black white also known as in chains ' is exactly the kind of and that the suggests has been thrown into a prison on a small island with a lot of other women and this place seriously makes the summer camp where stewart is locked up right now look like a prison it 's not five minutes into the movie that one of the guards the line and get ' and then we are introduced 
 the from so much there are the random musical through the movie the long script and enough to make jerry lewis and just do n't know when to quit it takes a full hour before the story finally gets to the main plot and the characters are then the guys start playing japanese with the standard of the day it is a shame the parts of the movie are when and are playing the stupid japanese guys but it gets 
 in an early role and i think her first role shows her nature in this soap opera is this a vehicle for political and extreme or what being a in real life she must have this script no wonder left critic roger loved this movie it 's right up his political alley the here i am glad herself from this to better roles in movies that not the liberal agenda

 christopher lloyd is funny and really as al the head this movie is much better than the first but it has great special effects that the first did not have as well as a much better plot and it was written for kids but adults have as much fun as the kids do tony does a very realistic job in his role but this is not a taxi is actually good and even seems to be very human in his 
 watched this on saturday afternoon cable man did it drag i got the and all that stuff no i did n't care one way or another about the of the characters but the of the story and the almost put me to is until ruth marshall got naked if you 're a who is not you may want to rent it ruth has a sex scene that 's pretty hot and then a sex scene that is a higher than 
 i almost saw this at an actual movie theatre an theatre no less but could n't make it there in the one whole week it played but yesterday i finally saw it on cable and well i was n't disappointed that 's for sure has done it again yet another bomb when will this woman learn when will the studios learn or perhaps they already have since this film was largely dumped with little fanfare and deadly one would hope 
 it appears that there 's no middle ground on this movie most of it takes place in a dream and like most dreams it 's often and it 's also a production with some great and fine performances especially by our 's and various other at the dream reception are and her with is a surprise and a at one point she gets to a from followed by the final of holding a for some strange reason then on the 
 planet is one of the best examples of hollywood films its influence was felt for more than a decade however certain elements relating to how this entertainment was aimed at a audience that is now gone have dated it quite a bit and the film 's sometimes sluggish does n't help but the story 's compelling central idea involving the ancient and from the has n't lost its appeal and continue to make this film a relevant must see movie 
 i did not read anything about the film before i watched it by chance last saturday evening and then as i was watching it i felt the of and into my i was so by the acting and the tone and the that i only partially to the my husband fell soon after we went to bed and i was under the impact of the film i wanted to wake him up just to say if i would ever vote

 i this movie thinking it looked like a historical piece what i got was a piece of pure garbage this movie was confusing in most spots in almost every spot and in all spots 's portrayal of a queen playing a young male scholar was at best ben should have been stripped of his for even considering this film as one of his projects shaw should definitely stick to playing at least the harry movies are more entertaining than this 
 who else other than can take the classic tragedy and change it around to standards no one in my opinion the one & is a stretch from the original tragedy but it holds up well its sick but yet funny and for the most part it follows the true and story but many elements are added will keenan gives a great performance as the acting is solid and the story is great many people look past these movies not only 
 significant this is a sick disturbing movie just like the sick director chambers lynch who also wrote it i do n't even know why i gave this movie a rating of it is not the fault of the actors for sure the cast certainly portrayed their roles well it is the way this movie was written and the way the characters were written which was the benchmark of a truly sick do know that i will never ever watch another 
 i just watched for the first time since seeing it in the theater almost N years ago and while i remember it at the time i do n't remember being away by it like i was today i really ca n't complain about anything in this movie craig is excellent as the lead character of boone i never understood why he has n't had a more successful career because most of his early work is outstanding as good as is 
 how do i begin this movie is probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen has no just sat through this movie and it was a failed to get even a single on my find it hard to believe that anyone would distribute this horrible film i felt that this movie was a failed attempt at humor the only thing that was worth anything about this movie was the i 'm pretty sure the reason i wanted to 
 that 's right the and the main character is an person what strikes me most is the message this film might address to all of you people there and the message is sad it says that it 's very difficult to do anything that 's amazing or maybe even without having to the governments establishment and other of this world and even if you try you might not be able to bear it it is about the battle of a 
 i watched this movie at a and i 'm glad i did n't pay for it this movie is just its full of dick and jokes and takes no pride in the action such as the in little germany i made a little list of things i enjoyed in the movie and a lot of which i did n't agree dave foley 's the jokes the jokes the was a no gary coleman the again making fun of bush we

 i upon this movie by accident i mean how else could i find out it was n't at all by the studios nor did i even hear about it 's release from my normally in friends after throwing my money away on so many bad movies this year i wish i could 've seen this one in theaters as opposed to mike judge is the master of humor in a low package just watch king of the hill for a 
 the script for this film seemed to be pulled right out of a N 's soap opera deeply films are great but only if the characters are compelling and in this film the only thing compelling was my desire to change the channel the 's sounds as if it were written by a novelist the great himself is no where near his famous and the victim is a she in fear from a tiny held in the hand of her

 when i think about tv movies i always think of this film i have watched it a few times on sky movies it was been a long time since i have seen this film was just and came across it on here linda goes on holiday with her son william at this holiday resort place they meet up with paul johnson taxi driver owns a bar and like a weird romantic thing william starts to fall for and paul falls 
 when this movie was released it spawned one of the great movie reviews it does but in a sort of way the casting is silly starting at the top frank and sir john as not enough makeup in cairo for that at least not while this film was being made but it 's rather amusing to see them try the performances run the from sorry the obvious to with very few stops in between the down character seems as though 
 what the do people expect in films these days anyway does is have to be something like ' or it 's just now i do n't claim to be an all knowing expert but i 'm about N i 've seen and own literally thousands of films and i think this director really gave this film a good effort believe me i was getting ready to as soon as the started assuming it was be awful and i was surprised

 how in the name of all that 's did this film ever get distribution it looks as if it has been shot on someone 's mobile phone and takes the girl victim scenario to whole new they literally for the full N minutes of the movie and that 's all they do there is no plot no tension no characters and not a lot of acting just and more gave up after minutes and through it to see if anything 
 is there any other time period that has been so covered by television or the media in general as the no and do we really need yet another trip through that time not really but if we must have one does it have to be as as the i like to think that bill and robert had more in mind for this two-part than what ultimately resulted especially given 's involvement in the hbo movie america letters home from vietnam 
 sure this movie is not historically accurate but it is great entertainment most pictures especially the later are slow and but the action here moves at a the story is basically a series of with very little quiet moments the action takes us from an indian on a one of the best parts of the movie with jean arthur excellent while attempting to the this is followed by her and being taken to the war camp and being later comes

 i first saw this movie about N years ago and i was expecting something funny similar to i was away i was on the floor laughing my off this movie is so great way better than the characters the the plot everything top independent film that was given two up by and and if two old white guys can understand the in this you know it 's good 
 i was able to see a of this movie through 's program and let me tell you this movie is good i have seen many movies but few have made me so or talk about the movie afterward as much as this one i had a decent respect for d before seeing the movie and now i am mad about them i will most definitely buy their when it is released on the and will see this movie you were 
 this movie is not very bad but one can not find anything new about the of de from this movie the movie tries to stay on the between and and it can not succeed at either the is really bad video quality 
 hell to pay was a disappointment it did not have anywhere near the substance of a b western movie and should in no way be compared to a movie like the was the plot was the was unnecessary and the acting was awful even the professionals could 've taken some from the carson school of acting the only positive thing about this movie is that it some of the top in the nation but you can see them in a 
 this is the most sort of traditional ghost story not even to any great extent by the use of irish locations if the great james had ever come up with a tale this thin does n't james in fact have a story called a thin ghost he would n't have bothered to have it appears in the as a to a of old friends this film 's producers his presence and the one movie industry would have earned this its

 the movie has a good start portraying an interesting and strong shannon lee and two very side characters through the first half but later something happens and all the sudden shannon turns into this straight faced second hand bad girl and the movie gets lost in it 's own context the second half lacks any kind of and is full of bad acting a horrible plot and even worse coordination not to mention the horrible actors they chose for the 
 i first saw this film when i was in the grade and i remember that it had a affect on me then i saw in again about a year ago i am now N and it still moved me in similar ways this is a great movie that the struggle of principle vs. 's character is the teacher that wo n't give in to any of the mr. that story also the struggle of how older people often resist change 
 how can this movie be described oh i 've got it i 'm not big on but this is just plain garbage anyone who would waste their money to pay to see it is just too sad for words 
 the worse film i have every seen like the other honest it is just an excuse for getting naked birds with their out do n't get wrong naked women is n't a bad thing but there is another film for that i sold this to my girlfriend as a classic bike gang due to reviews to be greeted with every other scene full of naked women about the place in the for makes me the most is all the bike 
 is a romantic comedy featuring two great actors that seem to well on screen plot is a typical guy wrong for girl guy gets girl format but makes the solid point that one must love with the heart and not the the mind addition of albert and his band of provides excellent comic relief overall a good movie not great but good 
 this movie was great and i was waiting for it for a long time when it finally came out i was really happy and looked forward to a N out of it was great and lived up to my potential the performances were great on the part of the adults and most of the kids the only bad performance was by himself there was one problem that i encountered with this and others like it movie all of the characters 
 in a word this film was boring it lacked life and spark a big problem is with the two leads law and had no chemistry he was boring and she was the were interesting but they did n't enhance the scenes if anything the to the audience from what was happening on screen none of the action felt real and hence the film failed to create any real drama or a sense of film had potential but it needed a 
 this is there is no partnership quite like and there love is genuine i 'm N yet this is as now as i 'm sure it was N years ago is an his direction is so sweeping so broad yet so intimate the last scene between and his wife de almost brought me to not easy for a old guy its so there is also a deep christian message implicit here the faith has in taking your glory with you 
 i do n't have words to describe how good this movie is only a like could have written such a real of the days of the movie kept me for many did the role of her life in this movie she put life in the role of and did no less in his role as it is hard to imagine anyone other than these two doing the role of and the looked so natural on and looked like a natural 
 i loved this movie and love this girl is n't just an pretty face she 's funny and really really she made me many times just by being very naturally rough with victor who was desperately hitting on her we 'll be seeing her a lot in the next coming years and probably also from director peter and victor raising victor is one of the best film i saw in a long time very it 's true nice funny well

 i must this comment with a sort of admission i i just have a soft spot for the original tv series i think the here it from the as far as casting in a supposed audiences would look for of the athletic williams iii or the cool michael and so forth instead we get giovanni as a rich boy who comes off as just like he is in all his roles in the office i used to work in i 
 i saw true crime when it was first released back in the and i have watched it many times since it is a great mystery about mary played by a high school senior in a california town who 's 's younger sister was and killed by an unknown mary meets tony played by kevin dillon a police who sees how bright she is and they decide to work together to try to find the suspects in this one true crime 
 this has the logical of filled with and the overall is just as will be used in the circle of hell at recreation time just plain would rather choose to watch N minutes of my computer going through N blue screens of death than watch this again ever horrible horrible know the good thing about swiss is that along with the you get some here it 's only and the excitement factor well that turns watching dry into an rush 
 i 'll say one thing about this film there are no you ca n't get watching this the problem is that it is too intense there is too much action and it needs that is the risk you take in modern action films you want it interesting but not this is way though the acting is fine and features a couple of names in gary and roy it still has the feel of a b film the best part of 
 however i am not one of them at least was for two of the time but the boring and third section of that movie gave us a taste of what was to come in this extraordinarily mess says he feels a need to make this movie but does n't want to the feels that he should stick with it but really does n't want to either a film about italian politics and elections could be but this is not that 
 unfortunately this is one of the worst movies i 've seen in a long time none of the characters are which makes this film difficult to watch they 're all year who do n't take responsibility for their lives i was only able to make it through a half hour of the film so there 's a chance things got better afterward but i doubt it i ca n't imagine five people as as they are would manage to remain 
 oh me rarely has a film me or made me as much as this one after a start with an intriguing it into not much more than a with some and sexual the usually excellent alice is wasted in this one and the plot are do n't bother unless you 're really desperate rating 
 the film has weird characters strange and an amount of dialogue about smoking the movie has a plot of a woman 's search for love although who would ever like 's character or reading of the dialogue i really can not say except that she likes to parker gives an interesting character performance who likes to smoke does his best to look pretty and as he and what is doing there oh she 's not really in it enough for 
 if hollywood had the of the audience at heart we would see N films a year with the kind of that is behind this film there are several of personal growth in this movie and while the characters are still very human even the learned are not that greed will profit you or no this is what our sad lives need more sense more love more more hope thanks this movie has an not ' cracks that run rampant in 
 i am partly a fan of 's work i say partly because most of his films fall into two categories brilliant and boring this film falls into the later film from the same fundamental problems as 's recent film 's moving castle an intriguing is set up but then immediately reduced to little more than a backdrop for some events that only serve to the plot rather than explain first third of the film reveals the world the story is 
 this is an excellent james bond movie although it is not part of the original and more famous series and it is a film it is very well done to return to the role he made famous was a of as was the movie in a way that his past to not play bond again was as great as he was in his earlier N appearances the script is outstanding as are the photography and the performances it 's the 
 i watched this movie when i was a young full of and it was about as a movie as i had ever ever was to see it may not have been a great movie my guess is it was n't i do n't really remember much about it to tell you the truth i only remember the sexual chemistry between and no woman in any movie has ever done it for me as the did in this movie i have 
 does well here especially considering this is only her film this one is often because it falls between N great successes to have and to have not N and the big sleep N both of which her with bogart granted this one is not up to par to the other movies but i think through no fault of her own i think there was some in having her a british lady no i think all the strange were boyer was 
 the film largely focuses on a robert taylor as a hunter and the people who have to put up with him set a hunt for numbers of it the end of a era of and is full of drama and for both the and the native americans taylor is by his of indians and his that the will never disappear in one scene he animal after animal while in another he indians and then the food they had cooking on 
 first off i just want to say that this show could 've done well way better than it 's doing now what brought it down was certainly the acting who acts as the main character looked almost worthy of her own show when she was on and unfortunately was a big let down not only can not act enough but she 's stiff when she moves she looks as if she 's not sure how the character would move or 
 this really is the worst movie i have ever seen for a while i made a habit of watching movies including earth delta force and all of these movies are compared to is n't much point in this piece of junk i think it 's more beneficial to my reaction to the movie which is as follows i become angry and i want to the tape out of the and it after roughly N minutes of rate this movie a 
 have n't seen the film since first released but it was performances by torn and farrell were photography excellent moving story line and everything else about it was of the highest standard yet it seems to have been pretty much because is an odd market for it but i have n't seen the film on tv or video which is sad has it had more success in us where it might be seen as a quite accurate historical drama always 
 this is a bad movie in the traditional sense but taken for what it is meant to be it is quite good very funny and well made although there are a few death scenes that are in bad taste what with as a girl and so on 
 i thought anywhere but here was a good stars two wonderful susan and which when i heard they were in a movie together i resist watching it was a pretty had it 's moments where i felt as if they tried to hard and there was also some really and material but there was n't anything in the movie that i absolutely even liked how they used the performance of the and all the little moments are and you want 
 richard is a tainted character in this movie he is a professional he 's been in prison three times yet at the beginning of the film he tries to make it four is a busy body selling information to almost everybody jean peters is amazing as the girl by is a period piece during the era where the red scare ruled the politics and is worked into this plot quite what is unusual about this film is that peters & 
 i believe the production value is ok probably deserves a or 's traditionally featuring good looking people with model quality and a little class but the let me a decent woman would do such i mean she is a man who would have sex with another woman and what 's more serious she is also active in the behavior only in de 's mind the film also have many aspects that makes eastern europeans seem all it 's just movie 
 i was not really a big fan of star until past years thanks to the advent of and post N video technology distribution i am able to into the past of all the great star episodes for those that do n't really watch every single episode and know them by heart through etc. general popular consensus will say i like the next generation the best that 's because and his crew were fresh when they first appeared after decades of 
 first of all i got this movie as a christmas present so it was free first this movie was meant to be in it is for the most part but whenever the main character is in her car the movie falls flat to what it 's not that hard to film in a car second the story is n't very good there are a lot of things wrong with why are they showing all of the deaths in the beginning 
 stay alive stay alive stay alive i am called the attention it was the and not the topic of the movie on a video i play that was created by a to kill the people and to live is that quite bad movie of the blood sees more or less sparked spread these scenes is they are the more actually indeed that bad is this movie very very bad but bad in all the do not recommend this movie to 
 this might be my favorite so bad it 's film of all time like many children of the N 's repeat of of spawned a phase of my man i thought k. was back then jet could him with both in a cast this movie has that include the and the lee van tv show but as a friend of mine says anyone can get a good movie made it takes true to make a film that starts with a 
 if you still remember that summer when you had your first first or first love this film is for you ok so this movie would and will never win an but as a i loved it there are some things in the movie that might just go right over your head if you are not part of the culture the kids being raised by a who 's both mother and father the youngest son being and with a being by 
 as far as i can recall 's to 's score are as follows N the final section of the a traditional tune played at the end of a party is repeated several times to give the children a last dance before their scene is a violin solo written for but eliminated from 's score for the sleeping beauty is between the end of the party scene and the beginning of the scene chose this music because of its relationship to 
 this movie about two italian brothers who came to germany with their family is just great it is n't an movie i would say it shows life as it is or was in the and when the main story takes place the characters are very nice but have also some dark sides what makes you believe that these are real persons great movie with great actors to show that life is not funny all the time but that you can 
 i have become quite of laurence in the past few weeks and was when i discovered this i have always found it wonderful when i run across a film where i do not have to have my finger on the control in case its of lady x is till the final scene and must have been a true for viewers back in i only wish people today could accept and love true humor instead of the trash talk people now 
 this movie probably seemed like a great idea in let 's make a movie about one of the greatest and most controversial athletic coaches of the modern era and let 's cast brian as coach bobby knight that 's where this movie went wrong why cast an actor who bears no of the man he 's portraying and then why let this actor turn his character into not coach knight but brian in a red as i sat watching this 
 this is one of the films shot in spain in the wake of the unexpected success enjoyed by the italian and as is typical of such efforts features an of established and emerging international stars robert shaw stevens martin fernando rey michael craig al sutton antonio etc ironically however this mess of a movie serves as a example as to why that most american of film became a dying breed in the and is practically or is that officially really 
 on the surface the idea of N was good it 's nice to see that the child could be a girl in fact sometimes as in the when are or are it 's very effective but in N it does not make me think that she could be a child rather she is a child with issues issues that maybe only a rather then a could help she does not look scary or rather she looks and film had potential 
 this movie has got to be about one of the worst i have ever seen the humor was crude hardly funny and been heard a million times before the start was noting special and it got worse and worse as it went on i got about through and could n't stand to watch any more of it i was only watching it on tv so it did n't cost anything but i seriously recommend you do not waste you time 
 i gave this movie a N and though i consider myself a science fan i found this movie very difficult to take seriously it was on one late night and i 'm glad i saw it for free this movie is probably good for a few but not much special effects are about average for the time period not awful but not great either of course we know more about now than we did back then but we really ca 
 this movie was supposedly based on a book i 'm not sure what book the script writer s read to write their but it has absolutely nothing to do with the true life of in italy instead it is an tale that takes at every to men note the following examples details number one lane 's husband on her and her marriage ends in a number two lane ventures into a local italian town and is promptly by every male

 i first saw now in N when it was broadcast on british television for the first time i was shell shocked after seeing this and despite some close competition from the likes of of the ring this movie still remains my all time nearly N years after i first saw it this leads to the problem of how i can even begin to comment on the movie i could the technical aspects especially the sound and but everyone else seems 
 bob 's cat ' is a average only really notable for the fact that it was the first tune previously were all black and white while were in the tale of a cat 's attempts to woo a lady cat and a dog 's attempts to catch the cat cat ' lacks the trademark energy and pace of most to be fair does n't have a great deal to work with warren foster 's script is thin and while he 
 i think this film version of is actually quite good it certainly is amusing well it 's not a as pride and but there 's very good stuff in it especially the city of setting the royal the roman the atmosphere that is excellent if you are a fan like myself you 'll love watching this film the performances may sound a bit too but i 've got the impression that this film like the novel itself is deliberately making 
 ' son gets severely during a lion hunt that goes a solid and engaging performance by the park has to venture into an and dangerous ruled by the evil and the earth a portrayal by and battle various in order to save his son 's soul meanwhile 's equally nasty son a perfectly turn by giovanni as and takes over an entire city as a and director the story at a steady pace and maintains a serious tone throughout this 
 i loved the first movie the second one was disappointed john was n't jean bob anymore as my favorite character but the third one what happened to the it looks low budget like a sat morning except for the which was taken from the first movie they really should have stopped after number N this just makes the rest look bad 's voice has changed but its not as as jean bob rogers also looks very strange i also do 
 i love and think all of her movies are great is one of her best it is a very movie that you really have to watch close to appreciate it a story of a woman trying to make it on her own and refusing to give in to that would make her life easy some of her movies such as the and time to kill probably did better at the box office and video they were very good but take 
 one of the best movies i have seen in a very long time has a way of looking at things that is completely unique and this movie does not movie has you throughout and with the seemingly topics addressed it keeps you to the screen there are no bad guys or good guys makes sure of that the characters are so perfectly complex you feel for each of them you care about what they have been 's use an attention 
 this film was probably the best scary film i 've seen in years might be a more accurate the ending was unexpected and therefore took me by surprise if it has any flaw it would be the of the whole meaning of life concept since truly knows that answer you definitely into waters when you that concept into a movie put that aside and the movie is quite pope should emerge as one of the next bright young stars in 
 and his partner jerry lee are together again in this i had no clue that they made one let alone two and for a film that was only slight better than turner & this time after he has to his dog with other dogs people and wait around for jerry lee to real stuff i mean come on now the original had at least a few good this one has a one jim just looks old and out both brothers 
 lewis plays an girl called she and drinks she does n't have a lot of friends and she has a nagging mother beverly finds herself growing closer to her mom 's maybe she is attracted to him of course i do n't need to tell you what happens after that this is probably my favorite tv movie this movie shows that sometimes everyone is to blame this movie also has the best acting that i have seen in tv movies 
 i love this movie it is the first film master have ever done it is based on the story of his life it is but it is very good it shows how master grew up in projects in new only did master start in this movie he also was the writer and director with moon jones the also has the no limit ice party on it this movie shows how master goes from bad too good and how he had 
 to make a film the and the real star wars would tax even a great is not that the fall of a good man into needs a good actor is not that first minutes are boring with only a few pockets of yet more light fights but there is a lack of edge because you already know which main characters survive to the original star christopher lee has a very fleeting role here and about the best idea is to 
 i waited a long time to finally see what i thought was going to be a fun and was shocked to discover direction dialogue a lackluster pace and an overall that the film throughout just not funny the sets looked cheap the by the usually excellent are and even the title song is the whole children 's book characters does n't come close to representing the married couple whose life is turned upside down when he loses his job for 
 a very disappointing film from oliver stone which unlike his recent fails to stimulate any sort of real talk radio is about host ' a very loud man who manages to upset a lot of people and yet still draw an audience most of whom mind you just want to ring up and abuse him his boss in the movie baldwin sums up his character very well by saying he 's just a salesman with a big mouth and as 
 being N myself i enjoyed this i related to the character ann august more than most would my mother as as but the feelings of is the same this movie is perfect in the aspects and 's and susan 's performances are so linked together that it 's the best dual i have seen in years their chemistry brings the characters to life they become real people i would recommend this to anyone who is hoping to get away because 
 one of my best films ever maybe because i was well into the scene in the late and went to many of but the film was a good story line and very good acting by and a up and coming phil not sure about his latest project excellent performance by lots of unknown actors who if you keep your eyes will see them in many of the today out of the bill the more i watch it the more of 
 ok not possibly the worst movie i 've ever made absolutely no sense there was no plot no no acting just 's what i thought when i first saw it may N caution this is a alert it 's also of me complaining about how bad the movie is so the movie begins and the characters are introduced but there is no character explanation as far as i knew the main character was new to this school but apparently not 
 i have been an fan since the late N 's early N 's when this movie came out it was a must to see it and after seeing it i went right over and bought it the movie is great i love the action it brings and the music is great yes i bought the on cd a recommended video for everyone to watch and enjoy 
 big s is n't playing with or forcing an agenda like say or though i like them both she states the obvious in near remarks her show wo n't change the world nor is it meant to but along with the brian and 's jay johnston of mr. show fame this is one mean show with an appetite for destruction my side 's were by the first episode look i love this woman and like her she just the lines 
 is a bright young women who falls unexpectedly in love with a highly eligible with a for losing money they get married but almost at once is to 's to lying gambling and getting into debt despite his flaws she is unable to resist his manner until she starts to suspect he may be thoughts toward her this is a good movie with an attractive cast a good script and possibly the single ending in movie history that 's maybe 
 the movie was terrible easily the worst movie i have seen in the past few years one of those movies i will be able to tell people for the next three years that it was the worst movie i can think of you for giving me an answer to that burning question what is the worst movie you have seen answer trust me i read the book enjoyed the message and was excited to see the movie but then they 
 words fail me this film was extremely difficult to watch and in i really wish i had n't done it although i attempted to sit through it until the end credits i have to admit i could n't last for more than hour so my opinion could be unfair however this film would require the most impressive final third in the history of in order for it to be given a review which is anything but do not watch any 
 we 've all see the and if you enjoyed getting by the bull you 'll take great pleasure in the opening act i must caution the however i considered taking my son with me but am relieved i did not this of contains a few that as as they may seem to the adult community a few are not for the these guys must get paid a great to some of the sometimes played at their expense in particular and 
 the movie was great and everything but there were a lot of mistakes in the scenes i wonder if any of the guys who were working on the movie have ever seen a match before first of all i do n't understand how she wanted to try for the boys team in boys and play in the same team and these are the rules and do n't get me started on who when they found out that she was actually 
 i caught the first of driving at the film festival rupert shows he can act past harry is amazing as the mother walters is as with a mouth worse than a i hope that this film is picked up by an american distributor so that everyone can see it this film is not only about driving but life ben rupert is torn between wanting to his mother and vicar father and wanting to live his own life it 's an 
 i have always been a fan of the show so i 'll admit that i am when the show 's run ended i felt like too many questions remained this movie to me felt like to see all the people i 'd followed over the past few years together at last was most rewarding i have heard that this is probably the only movie that we can expect if that is so this is the appropriate way to go out 
 just the kind of movie i love some very good british actors as well as the one and only sharon stone stone a well educated group of people 's lives playing on their to collect to write a murder mystery book she plays the female quite well while using her ample sex appeal to what could be considered one of the ultimate black is use to dark places within society and freely in in the visit after dark ' side 
 if you are a bit and like to waste some time you should try this one i wasted enough time myself watching it so i will waste no more explaining why it is so awful be warned oh i see that i have to fill N lines or more here we go every year or so some people think it is fun to start shooting a low budget film about the scary of the underground that hopefully will prove to 
 the worst movie i 've seen in a long time this whole thing false and the character especially so the potential for a good story is there but this movie never comes close to delivering every plot element just away 
 this must be one of the most titled films of all time the kind of title that a film because it neither the plot nor the characters a title like this makes a film even the french title is not much better too bad & must have been enough to sell it this is a long film but largely worth it clearly influenced by we have an story about a personal ad her rich husband a theft an identity switch 
 my husband received of for christmas and it was the best gift we received we watch it every time we need to and so far we have viewed it N times the in this movie is beautiful and the music is outstanding we also purchased the and we play it in our vehicles and at home when ever we need a pick me up and that too is daily if anyone needs a suggestion for a good gift for movie 
 the character name is and forever by the but it will also always to me personally at least remain the name and title of a entertaining and violent early N 's action directed by the cool who brought us the and two of the most ultimately heroes christopher and michael the latter with a little i guess will largely have to be labeled as a guilty pleasure because there 's no way i can convince anyone this is an intellectual 
 i borrowed this movie from library think it might be how wrong am i it is such a bad movie that i have to write something about it is so bad in the movie it is very painful to watch the scene with her she is a pretty girl but in this movie she is not at all but i will have to witness her attempt to almost all the other major characters it is so the of the film 
 i strongly disagree with regarding jim 's talent i happen to like very much i was skeptical when he first appeared on the scene because i was such a huge fan of his late brother john but jim has an that has gotten him very far and he has developed it well over the sue is one of his earlier films his weight is a ai n't that true for most of us and i like the film yes it 
 i saw the comment said great acting in my opinion these are two great actors giving horrible performances and with zero chemistry with one another for a great director in his worst effort robert de has to be the most and of all time 's performance all over the as she clearly has no handle on this character mostly because the character is so poorly written would be too swift an for this film 's although the film 's intent 
 as a girl moved away from her small village to tokyo leaving behind her two best friends and she returns as a young woman surprised to find that died when she was a she with and they are to learn that is being via the island of oh boy i this because i like asian and i think a actress unfortunately if i had to describe in one word it would be this movie is silly boring poorly and most 
 anyone who enjoys the of or any fan of who knows that the most things are the familiar things will really enjoy this film do n't watch it as a film in the traditional western sense but more like a 's tale it is and definitely for but once you start watching it you too will find yourself drawn into the definitely one of those movies that hangs with you for a few days after watching i 'll never look 
 we were waiting in line to see the good girl an excellent movie when some lady came up with this dollar bill advertising from come see this movie she said you 'll love it she then introduced us to the director of the film now this should have been our first clue i mean in how many situations do you have the director of the film standing out in the lobby people to see it is this a christian film 
 seldom seen since theatrical release in N has become a for of legendary now at last on in an unexpectedly package it is as unlikely to win wide audiences today as it was when first released 's N was a statement most felt that the novel 's story structure and overall tone would not translate to film and industry insiders were surprised when century fox not only acquired the rights but also hired to his novel to the screen but 
 de is a very fun action his great movie called el del and the spectacular tv los made another great de looks for moments a movie made in and luis are two great actors and here they have great movie is very fun and funny and it has de is a very fun action comedy that i totally recommend if you have a great i have to for all the talent he N 
 in the old commercial for blank audio the tag line was is it real or is it the same might be said for the events in this episode a and of the the first pilot of star mr. has the ship to take it to the planet in order to allow christopher his first who has been burned and to return there why the because to have any contact at all with invites a death sentence why this is so 
 in N this series was shown on local tv here in southern california i and many others have been for tape or ever since now all of a sudden here it is on i in january and now here on march N it arrived it was a long wait N years was it worth it so far i have just watched richard ii i 've only had the since N and i can truly say totally worth the wait the 
 with the death of her husband may an older woman faces a future in an urban world that views her as dead from the neck down and unwelcome in the sophisticated homes of her son bobby and his wife and a absorbed and daughter the central family is anything but warm supportive and understanding of her new and stage in life with the death of her husband the mother is a quiet character study that points up how in some 
 this movie is so the main character looks like he 's N and i 've seen with more balls than this guy the plot are so predictable its not even worth watching for the humor some of the worst dialogue i 've heard in N years lets go find a small animal to i ca n't even continue do n't watch this pile of garbage it was made in N one highlight is the drunk calling the main character a 
 just there are a lot of reviews on this movie already but i wanted to add some comments of my own i agree with most who have said this movie has terrible acting writing and boy does it ever however i think there is some other problems why is christian belief and the allowance for life exclusive the film acts as though you just ca n't be a christian and also allow for the possibility why they touch on this 
 attack of the killer consists mostly of poorly assembled in search of a movie the plot makes no sense and the various characters drop in and out of the picture with no explanation at all watching this silly you get the feeling than so many other comments have captured so accurately that it 's easy to make a cheap film and then use the as an excuse for its and low quality in one scene female are of that are 
 as i 've said in the title of this review it me to say this but reaches the zenith of what hollywood romantic can ever hope to to i 've been a critic of both the and it 's for as long as i can remember myself but on an almost note has caused me to spend somewhere in the neighborhood of two hours of my life with a ridiculous across my movie may be and at times but it 
 this is a very strange product from hollywood apparently it did n't test well because actors who have in the credits have been completely out of the movie which means a cut job was done on it it feels like it was out of the usually competent 's hands and just thrown away on the other and it is so totally lacking in substance that maybe nothing could save it it has no real center either or time although it 
 it was extremely low budget it some scenes it looks like they recorded with a home video recorder however it does have a good plot line and its easy to follow N years after shooting her step father is released from the psychiatric ward with the help of her doctor who she is having an affair with the doctor ends up her a house and buying her a car but within the first N minutes of the movie him and 
 i love the book it 's full of passion tension and the movie along taking two stars with it was already a major star in australia having in and her first single the decision to cast her in the was surely a marketing for me it did n't pay may have been great in but she was far too sweet and innocent to play the and she was n't of asian as was charlie was an excellent but there was 
 opera the u.s. title is at the opera is somewhat of a after some of 's other movies like and i still ca n't find anywhere it 's one of those movies that has a great first half but through it 's like someone started slowly letting the air out of the and basic plot involves a beautiful opera singer who is being by a fan this killer begins killing people close to her in a most unique fashion he 
 after a day at work i sat down to relax and turned on the movie channels the movie came up on the guide and sounded interesting so i in just before it started the first N minutes were enough to make me interested but the lack of acting ability in jamie and the slow plot movement made me want to get up and find food during the movie if there is any credit to be given for acting in this 
 is for me an object of my it 's got everything a gang of his through green 's director martin high and N hats moore 's unique comedy actually are close to the roots of no wonder dr. mentioned N times on his classic the add the best list of characters to ever grace a movie like the the and of course the one who no one knows until it 's time credit should be given for style to director 
 you 've got to think along the lines of last in paris for this one because the mood and runs along the same lines and maintains the same heights the difference being that in this intense and of love among the of a the setting is a perhaps even one that is set to in time and not the equally but context of 's own last third of this film a love never seen in to talk of or misses 
 i read the reviews of this movie and they were generally pretty good so i thought i should see it i 'm a big and art film but i believe this is yet another case in which the critics make something or intellectual into something it is not i will be blunt it contains scenes of sexual that i never ever wanted to actually see obviously the piano teacher has some major psychological issues but i really did not want 
 this is the biggest to ever officially does not exist in there will never be a female this took away from the tale of N male unique who will never have a family of their own once gone no more the biggest mistake was crossing over power to with a horrible episode the 's voices were wrong and they all acted out of character they could have done such a better job better designs and and no do n't bother 
 i hate to sound like an person ' but frankly i have n't seen too many movies that i like that were made after N generally movies just seem to get worse and worse although i quite enjoyed the scott vehicle the bread my sweet except for the ' sex scene which added nothing of value to that movie this movie makes the mother a former las vegas chorus girl seem to be of surviving on her own although she 
 i really felt the movie was ahead of its time the one potential was such a strong career woman she knew what she wanted and was diplomatic but firm with the to be the mother 's role was played extremely well you just loved to hate her her need to control her son 's lives was evil if you 've ever been in a relationship where you 've been and found lacking and everybody involved knew it this may hit 
 my mother took me to this movie at the when i was around seven years old which is years ago she had no idea a family movie would be so violent my memory was of the boy 's father 's face of pain as he was in the and killed this image me for weeks i had learned that i lived in a world where a person might my father at anytime how could i stop them how could my

 making this short and to the point this movie was great i loved it i actually picked this up at a hollywood video for N on and watched it about N times in the last couple weeks i 'm a big bogart fan and i just onto this movie i thought the song was funny and now have it as a ring tone on my phone robert is great and pulls off a good bogart his nose is a little 
 my above of the on the back of the box sums it up this film was far more horrible than is the worst film i have seen in as long as i can remember my wife it thinking it was the tom cruise version the crude special effects on the screen should have us off the already in the opening scene made us more as the film wore on we were by acting both and in and writing and crude 
 please give this one a and the rest of the cast terrible performances the show is flat flat do n't know how michael madison could have allowed this one on his plate he almost seemed to know this was n't going to work out and his performance was quite so all you madison fans give this a miss 
 i realize several ben movies are out or will be out this year but perhaps he should insist on quality not was at what the thought passed for comedy in along came polly 's is and ranks as one of the worst performances of the year 's is getting he undoubtedly has comic talent but he needs to either find another or take a break find some material that is actually funny because his movies are going from painfully to 
 this is one of joan 's best it was the first and made it evident to mgm and to audiences that they were a team leading the studio to make seven more films with them as film the downward slide of a brother and sister who after their father loses everything in the stock market crash must fend for themselves and work for a living life is hard in the depression and soon even their attempts at finding legitimate work 
 this is an boring movie we can feel some for the and and but the of are pretty hard to see and the ending at least for me was maybe it 's about how we all need love but i 'd get more out of a good 'm told that comments have to be at least ten lines so i 'll add that in the background are some interesting shots of the relationship between polish citizens and government employees and 
 i thought this had the right of character plot stuff and special effects without going over board it will take a while to get going but the acting was good and i was by the who is not to hard to look at i like the attitude too certainly not like other attempts at stories 
 i 'm not sure why this film is averaging so low on when it 's absolutely everything you could ever want in a film this is the definition of being a film i consider myself to be a big fan and i must say that this house the goods house of is the story of a group of college kids on their way to a football game whom decide to camp out for the night and have a run in 
 first of all before i start my review i just read every review for movie ' here and i ca n't believe that someone could give a negative review to a movie like this fortunately there was only one i mean i can understand how someone may not like wars ' due to the whole but to not like a movie some of the most in the history of is almost sad i will step off my now and review 
 for what happened to his movie in terms of distributors and secondary directors and doing script aside let 's just take this movie as it 's offered without movie is god awful straight up rather than what may serve as a plot i 'll run a highlight of some points that made me my class of N take a field trip for a history class to the middle of ' nowhere ireland these students may be canadian or american it 
 i like peter sellers most of the time i had never seen him an until this movie he pulls it off pretty well although you see of inspector in the mix it does n't get interesting until never expected the to deliver such a solid performance her timing was great and her were the way she sellers character down and him is beautiful to watch like i 've seldom seen from a movie of that last minutes of the movie 
 i 've seen the original english version on video disney 's choice of voice actors looks very promising i ca n't believe i 'm saying that the story is about a young boy who meets a girl with a history that is with his own the two are thrown into one of the most fun and intriguing in any film the quality is excellent if you 've seen disney 's job of 's delivery service you can see the quality 
 i was n't sure on what to expect from the box i am a huge fan of but also saw the mess that became of whether or not that was a studio up who knows with the box i was surprised it was a to classic films that hint at much larger but center on an intimate character slow build and tension was very effective to the tone and theme of the entire film any change in such would have 
 what percentage of movies does a person go to see these days that leave them wondering what happened to their eight to ten dollars answer too many this movie is n't like that it is a story about real people that are sometimes a combination of both and not enough character development & some plot lines left in the forces viewers to think about the choices they have made for good or bad in their own acted by scott cohen 
 warning avoid this awful movie if you watched it you will be and are age now what are they doing trying so hard to be young innocent and just not working at all and act so in this the script is absolutely i ca n't believe someone can came out with such ideas with the development of movie industry movie are not as easy to satisfy as the ones in the last century i bet the movie from last century

 this film never received the attention it although this is one of the pieces of acting and one of the most realistic stories i have seen on screen clearly on a small budget in a real hospital the center of the story is joel very by eric joel has been in a accident and comes to the hospital to a ward with other men who have injuries joel is in love with his married played by hunt who shows early 
 the story is a of actors along with producers and have very complicated relationships a resident playwright has written a psychological drama he wants to get a good production on stage but ca n't unless he a to the production and give a positive review if his production does not go on then the will put on the house recently written by many different relationships among the principals are none of them interesting but the involvement of the characters with 
 as a the movie was pretty bad it is only N minutes long yet several occur with the destruction of the headquarters one was the very beginning of the movie an battle that was better than the rest of the movie turns out to have been some kind of battle that right there was a major and made the rest of the movie lack credibility then there was the issue of tied up along with his and into some room 
 apparently a b movie b must stand for better acting and a better message than we get in big budget a pictures today movies aimed at young women surely are n't designed to encourage of character over behavior or increase the of young who do n't conform to standards after all the fake and flashy like this movie does ai n't help sell more products that depend on not being satisfied with their natural attributes or inner beauty day is

 let me first start with the obvious has been a serious problem throughout history present in many and causing the deaths of million of that said the problem with this movie is that it views the united states probably the most society ever to outside of israel as a not very different place from germany set in N the movie is about a man william h. macy who gets confused with a after he starts wearing a number of very 
 this is your standard musical comedy from the 's with a big plus that it features some well known 's actors in small fun is not much to the story and basically the movie is all about its fun and ' overall kind of atmosphere with a typical comedy touch to it it 's a story ' but i most certainly did n't thought of it that way while watching the movie the story gets very in into the that

 i came across this movie on by chance through a blockbuster rental to the is an excellent about a future grand tour of the solar system taking to to current knowledge about the and space flight and from existing technology this movie tells the story of on a to jupiter and special effects are excellent for a tv show i found the actors as the situations presented are for the most part and you learn a lot about the science 
 apparently none of the previous most of whom the film for its have actually read a of louis most is in the relationship between and in the N 's the latter was invariably shown in a bad far from an was an politician and a military who allowed france to be dragged into a war he was not the stupid here he had an interest in science and like many other people in the century saw a bright future because 
 this movie is a of the N warren movie can wait but it is written for the style of rock the remains the same rock is taken before his life time is up and works a deal with god 's representative king to come back to earth as someone else as in 's movie he chooses the murdered charles wellington a rich white man all because he king who happens to turn up at wellington 's house during the murder 
 i believe that this was supposed to be or something all that i can say is poor this is so poorly done that the parts that should shock and you come across as at best the characters are so and N wait N that i each sick death all except that poor 
 the movie has only one flaw unfortunately this flaw damages all credibility of the starts with the of the israeli of disputed it fails to address the reason are there egypt and jordan attacked israel this is why israel their land because those countries lost it in a war they film also claims that israel has the u by not with resolution problem is N was rejected immediately upon it 's inception by the making it films are put together 
 i was disappointed with the to the i can see what they were trying to do with the story show how married life was going for and but the story was n't interesting enough to hold my attention and it seemed to cover the same bases as the is n't funny the only bit i found was when was turned into a prince and then back into a and saw it happen and he was trying to convince them that 
 i seem to remember a lot of about this movie when it came out but had avoided seeing it throughout the years i wish i 'd waited longer maybe this movie was funny in N i do n't know i was younger then but it did n't seem like the world was that different pfeiffer lovely as she is is never convincing mercedes not only but it in her like a to save for later dean is about as convincing 
 this is one of those that if you knew it helps but is n't necessary what makes this even more of a story than is that this is n't something so far away in the future this has such a to it that it is quite it was not released the leads could not have been chosen better in such experienced & quite actors eric is as the father who will do anything to be daughter however real or not 
 now any fan will the big bad and some ' talk in this case add in a lead who ca n't act a plot that makes little sense by someone with no hands who has been and the most fight scenes and you have jackson ' not quite bad enough to be good but not good enough to be bad this is a wonderful mess from start to finish i especially loved the endless errors and the lead 's white 
 when this show first aired i will admit to being by the and the setting with an open mind i watched the first two episodes and naturally dismissed it as being to run for a at most i happened to be watching recently and an ad for this garbage and i could barely contain my surprise i truly hope people are watching this for a and not taking it seriously the characters are truly some of the most ridiculous and 
 this movie is the biggest pile of you know what being from and growing up in wichita kansas i know for a fact N of the movie was aside from the names of some of the victims nothing else much was correct the movie looks like it was made with 's it had that i believe came from another film along with stock from a house i usually enjoy watching bad films for the fun of it but due to 
 a piece that the film fan will fall upon with keep your and your this film is in the same company as the the original and it stays with you long into the night much like those cbs radio mystery theatre shows a smart rent 
 this film has the to suggest that it might be best to simply accept your life as it is and keep smiling anyway as one who is more excited by the idea of taking charge of one 's life and moving forward i felt in the face but that 's i do n't have to agree with a movie to love it and respect it great acting by and hurt and everyone else really and some scenes a serious film 
 i stopped five minutes in when was given a automatic with sights on it not only do not have sights but beat in combat the terrible wooden acting and that all original movies did n't help either having only gotten a few minutes in before i felt my rise and decided to watch i love reruns instead that 's really about all i have to say but you might as well just realize that it 's a movie and it 
 first of all i have to start this comment by saying i 'm a huge nightmare on street fan i think it 's the greatest series ever for me is the of course 's dead which tried to be the last chapter back then is a weird movie it does n't have the same atmosphere than the previous films has a lot of screen time some think it makes him less scary which i do agree and that 's in 
 definitely not your typical just never worked for me the movie tells the story of a gone wrong and a young boy who is in the process in their attempt to get away the leave a bloody trail of death in their wake as they hatch a plan to the boy the plan is never carried off as the are more intent on getting to france and the boy is intent on staying with them while i could cite a 
 one dark night has a typical film with a quite a unique twist the musical score and atmosphere adds greatly to this small film that is excellent as and leads us through the of the giving a sense of and the other are equally effective in their roles as is the ultimate of the film the special effects are excellent though dated this film is highly but that may be good so that it was never by endless there is 
 dramatic license some hate it though it is necessary in any life story in the case of the main points of ball 's years early career and N year marriage to are all included in a and main emotional points of 's life are made clear 's struggle to find her niche as an actress finally into the brilliant who made the character a her romantic and ultimately impossible marriage to & creating the first television empire and forever their 
 i 've read most of the comments here i came to the conclusion that almost everybody agrees that is a piece of history there are a few who think that the added is weak and i agree that the is weak and unnecessary about two brothers finding each other back after the disaster and the about tony but i do n't think is unnecessary like i lot of i think that our own lives are we are living and making 
 this was one of the worst films i have ever seen i 'm still trying to get over how bad it was just because it has 's name attached to it does n't make it great beyond the fact it makes absolutely no sense we see one long shot of a traffic that is not stunning or anything of the sort while this long shot of the traffic is going on you will be feeling probably more like making a 
 this is one of the movies i have ever seen this in my opinion is lowe at his best i 'm not quite sure why this film has gotten such a low rating i guess you either love it or hate it but if nothing else it is definitely worth a rental 
 although i rarely agree with i have to say that this film while not awful just did n't make me care at all and it all just seemed to be out of place it had its moments three or four ones that made me but most of the time i was just sitting and wondering why why did the characters do this even hot shots characters felt more thought out and out if you want to see a nice then 
 as one of the victims of the whole enron scandal my mother forced me to watch this movie with her how many times can i say awful the script was so weak using after it seems as though the writers this story together with a few articles on enron watching the movie we were able to complete about half of the characters ' lines and thoughts i realize this was supposedly adapted from a book but was the book this

 this is one of the best films i have ever seen how anyone can knock this movie just my first of all 's and harris 's performances were simply spectacular especially that is the only way i can describe the acting spectacular you have to imagine how difficult it would be to play a character like that and pull it off then you see and his performance was as for the plot since it was based on a true person

 i do n't know what it is with this movies but movies about history or are always by their of course it 's not N accurate it 's difficult to make N accurate films when even the experts disagree with each other therefore i rather like to judge a movie by what it is trying to say than pick on all the i start by saying that i liked this but i do agree with the that his years went 
 this film is a very beautiful and slow film there is nothing hollywood about it it is very and the characters are very real it is the first film to take up this theme it is really about love that has no i would not say it is about love even though the two main characters the and charlotte are attracted to each other it is a story about love and story pretty much takes place in the two apartments

 like all good art this movie could mean different things to different people to me it means that failing to open your hart to the others could you of and leave you with an empty live the convenience of the is like the junk food it feels good but eventually could make you everything i see in the us is a commercial mass production of action garbage and stupid and this sensitive deep and movie really touched me you and

 there are a lot of people that put down on these type N 's movies but those people may not have been coming of age during this time i was just starting college when this movie was released so i could really appreciate it at the time and my friends and i still to this day will occasionally joke about certain lines in the movie as much as i liked penn 's character jeff in fast times i actually enjoy 
 no one can argue with it this is and will be the best movie ever as it is the perfect definition of what any movie should be a collective beyond times no movie can give you more perfectly this impression that you carried it inside you even before you saw it for the first are images that stay forever 
 this review is based on the dubbed video released on an world in how bad is it it 's awful which is what a ' represents on the scale but it 's much worse than that it 's nice to imagine that an original print might improve matters the is n't funny at all but this is one of the worst films of any you 're likely to see the in the film are as slow and as ever and

 as a young woman i am always searching for movies that represent the and lives of people like me of course when i saw this movie at the video store i thought i would enjoy it unfortunately i did n't although the topics presented in the film are interesting and relevant the story was simply not properly developed the movie just kept dragging on and on and many of the characters that appear on screen just come and go without 
 without a doubt N is one of the best films of the and director terry is no at pulling off such an film that holds you completely N never lets up and has you all the way throughout excellent use of philadelphia and sets create a sense of tragedy and two people caught in time at the wrong his image and a true who happens to be right about all that will happen he is actually but the people of

 this movie was good relatively during the first parts of have a story from N points of view so let 's find some clues and complete the wait none of that stuff matters because the fbi guys are the bad guys though that was a great twist it was almost a terrible twist i immediately downgraded the film from a N maybe N to N based on the last minutes of anyone else not see why the twist is so

 the for this film is by video a company that almost always releases the poorest quality prints in 's defense often that is the only print available but the specialize in public and films if you can find another print by a different company try it first as the print for this film is and faded still compared to most this one is excellent especially since the sound is pretty clear and never seems to include closed even with films 
 if this is your first time experiencing the of if you 've never seen a moving picture before you 'll think this movie is a child of the but if you 've seen a movie a tv show even barney the then you wo n't be very impressed by this film barney the was even more realistic than the in this i like b movies i just watched the giant monster right before i watched this and i liked that

 there was a approach to this film on the part of director with interesting camera and effective it was also to see and given leading roles and expanding their range as performers this film also included one of the most escape scenes in recent years the efforts of the director and the actors combined in an effective the of the film was the story very clearly as the of corporate greed and were N george suggested in his famous novel 
 i felt as though the two hours i spent watching this film may have been better served by perhaps going to the local used and looking for old fashion magazines and ads or perhaps by watching dry those two would have at least engaged my mind a bit more than india song the most frustrating part of sitting through this was that i could see what were trying to be created and the notion of these could have been interesting 
 yes i know i 'm one of the few people to this movie into the dust of let me me tell you why i feel this way in truth had it been as a film or the like i might have enjoyed right now i 'm totally though i 'm not sure what 's to let 's start with the first huge flaw if i did not know that the movie is called the version and had i not seen

 this movie is one of the greatest movies of all time if you suffer from it is a way to guarantee hours of sleep at a time as the movie slowly the audience into a state of and gradually loses sight of any sort of plot that the movie might actually contain this effect is surely created due to the lack of sweet mr. was obviously unable to master the art of a prime example of this is the scene

 this film is trash and proceeds to become even worse the very end the plot is confused and the actors have a could n't care less attitude maybe they were paid in advance bad move or knew they were n't going to get paid and the sets were boring and fell twice and actually decided to not bother with the last N minutes as i assumed the actors would have fallen themselves by then more life time wasted if you

 love that i think is the main message mike 's newest film over me brings across whether that love has caused your relationship to become or has brought anger from the one you love cheating for years or has broken your heart to the point of being unable to open yourself up to the world love the great thing about this film however is not in its portrayal of these lost trying to let their past go but in the

 was one of the few women to break through the glass ceiling in hollywood under the studio system not surprisingly she also themes that when touched at all were approached in so a manner that it was seldom quite clear what was being talked about in she rape and its aftermath and though throughout the short movie it 's referred to as criminal assault ' she leaves for once no doubt about what powers in her official debut plays a 
 this is what happens when you try to a play from the theater look at the end of the picture totally a of the final speech try to make us think that the whole and deep theme of this matter was the who by this point it was about manipulation and so the audience feels after this movie has directors a play is told with the words more than actions a film is the opposite most of the i 'm 
 a scientist john finds out how to bring the dead back to life however they come back with faces of marble eventually this all leads to totally predictable this scared me silly when i was a kid but just me now i had to struggle to stay with one exception the acting is horrible such boring actors are some good things about this despite the script actually gives a very good performance and there are a few mildly moments involving 
 ok so i just saw the movie although it appeared last year i thought that it was generally a decent movie except for the which was stupid and horrible first of all we never get to know anything about the creatures why they appeared are they doing in our world and really have they been on earth before we were or did they just come from space the role of the butcher to maintain order is just so obviously created

 drive proves once again that david lynch is the master of expression at the last night i a brilliant addition to the history of the performances are the score and the photography david 's ability to the many elements of film making into a unique and stunning experience is as i watched drive i could n't help but realize that with david lynch in this world we are truly the is as well for in the films of david lynch 
 what a disappointment i 've enjoyed the jon books about but there 's little between him and the in the books he 's a city who is devoted to his wife and does n't get involved in for the film the character has been up into an copper who uses his and is n't to jumping into bed with a girl though quite what she and the film 's other sex interest see in him i do n't know taylor 
 i 'm trying to decide if jumping into a wood would be more than this it the destruction of what was once a classic couple of films with and we have the death of ' career he wants us to the is nonsense i never believed it was true this film those feelings the story has n't worked since and each new film just the on until all that was left was a toy parade i have to go i

 this is not your movie this little bitter has very little blood and its basically a version of open water that is effective and but what sets it apart is that we actually like the three leads unlike open water who find themselves up a tree when a their fishing boat and up their guide we do n't want any harm to come to any of them so when they start getting into dangerous situations we actually care now i

 this must be the most boring film i ever saw the only positive i can say about it is that i did n't pay to see it we were given a free showing in school and everyone in the audience just sat there embarrassed wondering when the fun would start this piece of junk is a badly way too long film the actual idea on why making the movie took about N seconds to present the only ones who can 
 not just the money we paid to rent it or actually go to the movies i 'm talking about how big productions companies waste so much money in things that actually are boring and not to talk about ridiculous with the millions they used to make a movie like this because i do n't think the actors here would actually work for free or for an sum with that money imagine how many good independent movies you could make or

 i saw this film in recently appropriate given the location used i first read lawrence 's book back in the N 's and for me it 's always been a very powerful picture of the trials of aging in our society it when i was young and it even more now when the film came out i was keen to see if the story could survive and was impressed especially with 's performance she manages to give us a complete 
 definitely the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life i ca n't find anything positive to say about this movie if this production is even worthy of that word this production is not even the standard of a low budget my question is simply why did someone look at the script and think i 'm make a movie out of this at the end of the movie i was n't even hoping that was going to make 
 light alert the story sounds good and if you 've read the novel then you 're probably expecting a deep and intense movie that could offer some insight for some interesting and human enough the script tries to do that the director tries to do that but the main cast fails maria 's acting is so dry that lacks any feeling her most intense moments seem almost sometimes she seems to be nervous due to the camera her only really

 working at a video store i get to see quite a few movies and on occasion i try to watch some of the not so big movies proud happened to be one of them the initial idea of telling of the story of a primarily black ship during had some merit however in less than N minutes of watching the movie you find out that the primary point of the movie was to tell about racial tension in the underlying 
 this movie had very few moments of real drama after the opening minutes the film in a that did n't quite take us to hell and back was pure to say the least the acting was more than the subject matter of the film and at times i could n't stop laughing the between some of the scenes was dire characters disappeared from scenes without explanation only to be replaced by other characters who minutes earlier had been some where 
 completely worth checking out saw it on 's birthday N and it hit me big time sometimes it feels like we 're all in a trap and are doomed to repeat the past no matter how much we try to change all we can do is to keep on going and speaking out just keep on going do n't mean to be a because that 's not the point but maybe we need to get down before we see how

 no one should ever try to a tom book for screen while the movie is fine and the performances are good the dialogue which works well reading it is when spoken or to put it another way no one would be likely to suggest that hearing someone else 's name was like seeing it written in on a the movie feels like a notes to the book most of the parts have been down to a fifth of their size 
 a widely unknown strange little western with probably the same material as it was used in i guess or something which makes blood look like nearly scenes with action and characters something different far from being a but there should be paid more attention to this little in western 
 note to george and others the mystery science theater N is i do n't think so favorite is why were you looking at his ' simply for the complete that and right well did not over all i would say we must give credit to the crew for trying to this tv movie you really ca n't make much fun of the bill s was a good playwright on the other hand this production is so bad that even he 
 i enjoyed the movie very much everything in the italian job is simple an explosive guy a a computer a and a man with a spectacular plan of stealing N million without using a gun this film is entertaining although it has no central idea it is a movie with lots of actions all the work is from the chase in venice at the beginning to the chase on the busy roads in los angeles involving three coopers and even 
 when this show first came on the air i saw it once or twice and thought it was another fat guy wife show that seemed to the networks at the time it was just upon initial and i did n't watch it again however once it went into i caught several episodes simply because it was on twice a night and i 'm telling you the more you watch this show the it is once you see how all of 
 this movie was i ca n't even call it since that requires more from a movie than merely taking place in space max is n't even set in space for the entire movie the is the cast is n't anything to write home about although it would be strange with a top cast in a film furthermore it 's not particularly exciting or at least it 's evenly balanced in a low quality sort of way in that nothing or 
 cover girl is a musical with absolutely nothing about it save for its signature song long ago and far away this film came out before gene kelly really hit his artistic and while there are of his talent here mostly he plays to and there 's the problem is no doubt about that but she 's simply not a compelling screen presence i 've always found myself wanting to like her more than i actually do and this movie is 
 well anne is way way too old looks younger than she and he should not is much too young and too oh sister mary is way too pretty she is supposed to be average not pretty when this actress complains the way mary should all i think is that she is too pretty to be a lady russell is too old this is crazy if you read the novel she is anne 's older more mature friend maybe as old 
 seymour gives a great performance a tour de force his acting as supposed up beach duke will always have a place in my heart the film is centered around a who just came to the beach in hopes of his dead brother 's dreams what he gets is guys cheating guys fighting and guys getting drunk going to watch with the whole town of la on a friday night duke takes the in and tries to teach him how playing 
 kill me later has an interesting initial a woman blair on the verge of jumping off the top of an office building is protects a bank max who promises to kill her later the actual execution of this however falls flat as almost every action serves as a mere device to move the plot toward its predictable conclusion written characters who exhibit no motive for their compromise the quality of acting all around lack of character especially blair 's performance 
 although i found the acting excellent and the beautiful i was extremely disappointed with the of the significant portions of the is the fact that and decide to kill themselves rather than go on this is never presented in the movie they show it as if it were a character changes in and are almost while in the they almost change places at the end of this it appears as if they are both that and their relationship fully nearly 
 's pretty much the whole to this film i just saw this baby at the film festival and it rocked the house director doug is never seen in this nor i think he is even heard but he has done a very intimate look into the lives and history of the he has his film into about eight and then his group of enthusiastic interviews will be throughout according to what they are talking about i was never big into

 i like and wanted another one of her films so when i saw protocol for $ at i purchased it although mildly amusing the film never really hits it a some scenes such as a party scene in a bar just goes on for too long and really has no of course there is the scene at the end of the film which gives the whole film a bad taste as far as i 'm concerned i do n't think 
 well now this was certainly a surprise episode in this science series with all of this beings extraordinary and many with the this episode would certainly rate as unusual its seemingly apparently not any morale at story 's end or does it off with the silent movie form no recorded but having musical in this case it 's on the sound track not the playing of or piano by an on sight this part of the episode along with the 
 so it 's a space movie but it 's low budget you ask what about the effects the effects are at times good and at times really really bad i mean bad and notice i started with the 's a story here but it 's told in what i think is the wrong order i do n't mean a style wrong order i mean it 's told in a completely arrangement most of it 's about a mother in the 
 an excellent family movie gives a lot to think on there 's absolutely nothing wrong in this film everything is just perfect the script is great it 's so real such things could happen in everyone 's life and do n't forget about acting it 's just just look at and you 'll know what i thought about this picture is a real 
 well acted tightly movie had me on the edge of my seat i liked the lead actress very much and thought the was very well done not much to on here in the way of a theme but if you just get in your seat turn your brain off watch the fancy camera work and enjoy the plot you will have a great time the plot is well and regular movie will probably know more or less what to expect 
 it was n't the worst movie that i have ever seen however that is only if i get to count home movies made by N year this movie was horrible from start to finish nothing about it made it worth watching unless you wanted to show new how not to make a film 
 i really liked this movie it was good and the actors were brilliant leon robinson who played richard and many other classic is very good at his job when you see him in a musical movie you know that it is going to be good i would suggest that people watch this heart warming sad and special movie if they want to know more about richard outstanding fresh 
 i love this movie like no other another time i will try to explain its to the but for the moment let me quote a few of pieces the remarkable dialogue which please remember is all in and will understand everyone title song he can sink a beer he can pick a in his latest gear another song all are or worse and england is the a of the universe during a television interview on an program mackenzie what artists 
 are very good movie she happen on a mental home in e. is in a leading role and is good other good actors in this movie are and i like this movie she is very good i voice with this movie 
 dean 's performance is what stands out in my mind watching this film she out the tone of the film with an energy i would like to see more of her 
 i personally liked the of N a lot christopher was as always great and even though the film was n't it was a and highly original film that this N is still worth watching but mainly due to is one of the greatest actors around in my opinion and he is once again outstanding in the role of the fallen whom he plays for the second time here once again the war between fallen and loyal angels is brought to 
 might contain is just a good movie lots of good silly stuff to at however do not watch the tv version they cut to much out is rather as the mafia don who is hired to kill robin all i can say about his ten minutes it 's a long drive from jersey also you got love them checking the script to make sure robin gets another shot also century bad stuff the at the beginning and the end seem 
 i am uncertain what to make of this N attempting to be a new between on golden and the prince of this film ends up being an mess shifting so between comedy and that the emotional pitch always seems off the main problem seems to be the difference between marshall 's direction and mark ' dark rather confusing the story focuses on the relationship between mother lilly and daughter who have driven all the way from san francisco to small-town 
 there is only one word to define the whole movie that is awful how mostly was is awful the title of the movie is awful the actors are awful and the idea of combining good cooking and usa is awful if you have seen well that is the original title and it means beautiful this one is a in the the acting of is so poor and that even considered one of the worst would have done better not to 
 at its best is entertainment if one is to question every aspect with which one finds room for disagreement and much of recorded history is based on contemporary opinions often then one should leave the because their will always their when i spotted an flying overhead in a film dated i was the background in is fake so do i set up a & say that the film failed to convince relax and enjoy some excellent acting 's decision to 
 in some ways the of 's death but it also loses some of that film 's the plot of this one is more than the first which is quite amazing the second half of the actual is a lot and a lot harder to through until that is you get to the battle scenes only the 's are better lang and the the of the did n't know a from his right ball and as a result they are more 
 after two force and the harry seems to have regained his in sudden impact a that plays to its strengths the of who also directed and a story that spends just enough time on and reserves its energy for the big once the case takes harry outside his native san francisco where he 's again in trouble with his for his shoot first ask questions later tactics to the of san there warning potential a group of is being murdered 
 i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a in los angeles the fact is that there are no in los angeles this movie should not be in los angeles it should be in hawaii hawaii has which is a real fact that this movie should be made in hawaii 's state capital this movie should be in hawaii because 
 here 's a review for people like me this movie from beginning to end i threw at the screen and to entertaining myself a la the plot on chance and relies on from people who are supposed to be smart the lead falls for a con man and it does n't occur to her that she might get and she 's rich and she 's a famous come on people she enters the bar at just the most convenient moment 
 basically is the story the of the show is interesting however the writers follow so many story lines and it with too many characters that it down the the plot at speeds what tension it might have had in any given episode little or nothing eric is a military contractor working on a using a stolen chip unfortunately his only working prototype is driven by the ai version of his dead daughter who died in a caused by soldiers of 
 i was on france around march N and i love to go to this film i knew about this de but i 've never went to it i decided to go and then i caught van the film is stunning it does n't caused the impact on me like with the mexican users because it was but it 's still film is a about urban violence about and crime on the streets in mexico it is a crude portrait of 
 have you ever seen one of those shows that became so popular that it could eventually get away with any nonsense and that it 's can get away with if you have n't then you 've never seen family of the show seem to think of it as and it 's none of these it is however and humor of the show comes from two irrelevant the show often has to things that have nothing to do with the plot 
 those french and those germans sure have a long history of not each other it is interesting to note that or in translation takes place in only a few years later would germany and begin his plans to take over the world france being a casualty of his ambitions but these are times of compared to the future a group of miners at the border try to cross over to france to get work they are back and later at 
 little seems to have the art of having the and eating usual the pure display can be explained as a way of sending violence back into the audience 's violence is is it is well worth in it to make that point how very part of the audience may well not be enough to follow all the smart to higher levels of though but i 'm confident they 'll see the light one for making this little world of a 
 this is a good of 's novel good but not is crossing at times the border to but it certainly the trap of making this look like a boring tv soap in given that the entire story is acting is competent is as her character requires but the required distance from the other characters is accompanied by a much less appropriate from her own actions in other words she does not seem to care enough of the results of her 
 how truly sad that this from the same mind as possibly one of the best films in this where do i even begin i think one of the must aspects of the film is that we are supposed to be and yet we see no in the film no more than N minutes of the film is spend about the possible death of another human these are horrible one of human beings that 's how they are played with what 
 well as the headline suggests this is not the particularly good movie i was hoping it would be i thought it would be great with fully man himself but not from the beginning i literally lost interest immediately when N women are just making tea and then suddenly she points out there is random water coming from under the door then a full on flood through the route of the house its hard to believe they did n't notice the 
 look you do n't watch this movie to change your life but if you are female especially and have always had a little thing for richard this movie is right up your street lane and richard have on screen chemistry going way back in ' is not a winner movie and it will probably be forgotten sooner rather than later but if you want an atmospheric shot love story between middle aged good looking people they do n't make your 
 a man is a hotel with a partner he finds out the hotel is things just get worse this film has a huge of scenes they must have been put together in ' sleep it around from place to place it does not stay focused on anything for very long the ending starts on christmas morning with a hotel fire it then cuts to a night scene of that fire and then cuts back to day time the sound track 
 plays a doctor who will do anything to keep his wife looking young and beautiful to this end he drugs during their to make it look as if they are dead so he can steal their bodies i 'm not exactly sure what he does with the bodies i do n't remember it ever being fully explained all i know is that he something from them and it in his wife i 'll just guess that it 's was all 
 truly unique and stunning film of 's for the flag by the master director the story is enacted in a rather late style the are a uses graphics painted sets model combined with live action to create the atmosphere of that the reader associates in his mind the style resembles the steel of and and that illustrated these stories with a healthy of in beautiful black and white the is of the highest order and not of a saturday morning 
 definitely one of my movies the story is good acting is great all especially are sharp and the script is is as edward kelly he is as the legendary and is supported well by rush watts and all action are on film is seat stuff right up to to the end one of my films from the late who has been the highlight of every film he has in and makes no mistake excellent film all round 
 this was a movie of which i kept on reading the reviews again and again and despite it being played at film museum and not at i decided to give this movie a try the reasons were many in the reviews it was compared with pulp it had several parallel stories running in the movie and it had already won N internationally in various categories i was eager to see this movie and due to my off day at i 
 this a piece of only ten minutes long but i would sooner pay ten into the to see this than to see any full movie currently doing the it is a simple piece of a man 's arrived a young man in this place and was by a room and the music coming from it and now here he sits dying in old age in this place he so to his youth the music in it is brilliant the have 
 the only part of this movie was the price i paid at least all i lost was $ and the time sitting through this bomb the crew member who was in charge of missed the boat when the female lead and the fbi guy went to the alleged location mr. fbi handed the female a when the alleged killer came out the door the has transformed into an automatic one is left to would an agent hand a weapon to 
 only saw this show a few times but will live in my memory it is very frustrating that it is so difficult to find this anywhere to purchase and yet there seem to be endless of stuff like friends especially even more difficult to obtain being in england i guess they say it was low ratings or was it a complaint from the themselves maybe it was just too for certain people just about the one comedy i would love 
 all is n't it amazing the power that films have on you after the i was so by the first of this film i could n't stop talking about to all my friends for weeks mind you i was a very N year old back then and my taste in films have become a little more conservative since somehow i about this film until i saw the in my local department store and how great it was i thought right 
 this film is really really bad it is not very well done and is a lack attempt at something but i am not sure what i watched it and was very disappointed it promised a lot but delivered nothing at all the characters are and wooden and the music if you can call it that is there are of course all the creatures and beings but they are so poorly done that it does not come across as anything other 
 before i watched this film i read a review here that this film could possibly be one of the best films ever scene by scene the tension grows from the characters in this movie from the little girl talking and trying to the little boy to the killer just running about without any notice and who was the guy at the beach talking to the little boy things just seem to happen and then go in this film as i 
 i just have to say that this was the third worst movie i have ever seen right after the attack of the murder 's N and it was n't just or the paper walls or even the guns shots which just disappeared with no in the walls it was the horrible acting no wonder that i have never seen these actors before they all probably with the director s i think being nice to this movie now but that is 
 do n't look in the this little forgotten holds a special place in my heart and on the video list the box is classic the main character although way than most low budget is a pretty standard low budget lead the doctor masters character is well written and well acted some of the lesser characters are stupid but add to the of the movie it 's i ai n't trying to lie the character that makes this great is a 
 although i love this movie i can barely watch it it is so real so i put it on tonight and behind my bank of computers i remembered it but just wanted to see if i could find something i had n't seen before i did n't that 's because it 's so real to user wrote the ages of the should be shown with their summary i 'm all for that it 's absolutely obvious that most of these 
 this movie is so great its set back in probably the N 's and 's character struggles to be known as ' plus tim is so in this movie and everything about it has a feeling it i watch it i feel happy it 's definitely a girl movie and i 'm a girl so i like it i also love the music the violin is but besides that i think it 's a story and everyone should watch it 
 i think this movie was made first they shoot a whole lot of scenes and action and explosions and then the got to work trying to find a story to tie all scenes up together this movie is without any doubt the worst movie i have ever seen your average movie comes with a much better written and much more script the movie makes no sense seriously even if you are a fan there 's no reason you should ever 
 i hate this not only is the very concept but it tries so hard to be something that was left out of similar i ending like she wrote why is it that the writers ca n't ever be enough in this to come up with evidence that would stick and win a decision in court come on after of years of the cases being why must every suspect every episode damn it to a murder which would otherwise go i 
 what can be said about a movie about a cross not that much with the average style this film has the timing all wrong is just awful as far as the story it might have been pulled off if the did n't lack character everyone just seemed to be there for some sort of line none of which were funny the usual suspects in this film are the hooker with the heart of gold the dying mafia father that wishes 
 there 's not a moment in 's it 's surprising how much is packed into this short film while on a beach after a a young is approached by a girl seeking a light for her cigarette she invites him to make love in a area near the beach on returning to the beach they find that all his clothes have been stolen she him a summer dress to cover his and requests he return it next day he his 
 i bought this movie at a garage sale when i was like i it then and watching it again just for the hell of it it 's even worse now you can hear the director and in the background like the are no special effects just a raw piece of meat that is supposed to be a brain this is and i originally thought it was a one of a kind home movie or something that i bought but this 
 is robert 's and one of the great of the on a novel a writer the director often worked with see also which did not direct but in which he was the lead too the you from the first pictures on a desert road by night where a beautiful might be the of the criminals to the house where he finds his and her begins a cat and mouse play of the is in a is she really disabled which 
 one of the worse movies i have ever seen since these are not characters in this story it 's hard to comment on the actual film therefore since ford laid his life open for all to see i guess he 's fair game to and that 's not hard to do here goes N something is a big time star who wants fame and fortune as a big time singer i guess N films makes him a star being and 
 the first movie at the festival in vegas and the most challenging it 's not a movie for everyone a number of the films that followed used predictable classic to tell predictable stories this picture seemed determined to do its own showed some comic as the over the top he dominated every scene he was in his about like leslie playing it was great to hear his explanation after the film he had such a good sense of humor about 
 and movie in which the characters stand around in rooms or a rocket ship and talk you might think things would up when they explore but these scenes are through a heavy which makes everything very the consists mainly of drawings and the are entirely there are of of the monster ' when the carefully the like of a eating plant around her before about the difference being that the ed wood film is a hundred times more entertaining better 
 a group of N gold head into a mine that was recently opened back up after an earthquake of course they do n't pay attention to local that something is down there and killing people this low budget $ N N has a slight following and i 'm not exactly sure why unless it is because it is so i 'll admit the last half hour is pretty entertaining but the hour getting there is pure lots of walking and 
 do n't be by the other although this film contains an impressive array of talent the material they present leaves a great deal to be king 's N numbers are pretty and not even close to his later efforts though he does with his piano playing ' is not a bit funny though i remember her as a very entertaining talk show guest from my youth actually the best performances are from a couple of fat guys who with a 
 i found myself very caught up in this movie at least at the beginning and any credit i give to this movie is she was but where it ends i seem to be very good at figuring out who the killer is and i like it when a movie is able to completely me but i felt out and out to they whole time they lead you in one direction and then suddenly they decided to go in a completely 
 blue is a movie with to be some sort of statement on man 's to man on the white man 's of and peoples a and commentary on the of vietnam well sorry but it fails to be any of those things what blue actually is is badly made here hit the on the head in saying that it appears to be a hybrid of two entirely different movies what it is basically is a poorly acted odd couple and 
 a plot and dubious do n't make any difference when a movie is as fun to watch as this one is action and spectacular for their day give this movie some real zip and there 's some actual comedy from the chemistry between the two leads makes a good also although his role is completely do n't be by 's tough broad role this is as as any hollywood movie of this era you might be able to that because 
 while i am a fan since we used to watch over the dinner hour in the early i can not think of any possible reason why he wanted to do this film whether for personal development or business reasons did he lose a bet as a movie fan i like to appreciate the bad films along with the great ones but shoot or be shot does n't have any or funny or there were no scenes or you 'll miss 
 no way i first she is way too tall course she is it is tom whoever 's brother who 's playing and i hate that thing she does when she her fake silver hair back but there are funny parts in this movie for instance the fact that every single actor looks very german and also that they think that even when left alone they should that that guy tom is their actual or something i specially liked that moment 
 i ordered this movie on the as it is very difficult to get movies where we live i 've heard so much about the tv series from my friends and practically everyone in turkey i was expecting to see a in what a and my husband who is an of any movie with a bit of landscape and in it only watched it all the way through because we had paid $ N for the well that was a boring 
 let me start out by saying i love movies big budget low budget big name actors no name actors it does n't matter and when it comes to judging movies i am very this movie however is pretty actors show little or no when delivering their lines and the acting is worse than many lower budget i 've seen as the actors get killed off you could care less there is very little i have no idea what film other 
 i watched this movie by accident on tv and it was so awful i could not switch it off every single piece of and intelligence has been removed from the story by the writer it barely matters because the dire acting and music would have anything like a decent script anyway the worst performance comes from patrick stewart who comes across as the most minor as the ghost get out of here he at one stage while his arms like 
 i this movie and watched it N times before i took it back to the store bill hired some first rate talent to make a good with some interesting the story is original and well written powers and both deliver good performances the story is told in an interesting manner with both N years back then spots in the present back and forth this style of makes for a good that ca n't get bill please make more movies you 
 the story as i understand is based on real events that can be either good or bad depending on what sort of license is taken with those real events and how they are this case the results are enough to a i was n't expecting much going in anticipating a story of rich high-school kids taking an ocean cruise under a stern skipper that is what i figured was a movie along the lines of something about camp or basic 
 i 've already on this film under the name but i see there are others who have since all i can say is what the f k i can not believe that a whole N people have on this film or even seen this movie add to that the fact that a couple give it great reviews probably the makers of the film who went to one of those places in a strip mall that provide service and wrote a 
 had this been the original N version of of the storm country also mary i probably would have rated it a lot higher as this sort of extreme and was pretty typical of the however by N this film was already starting to show its age and compared to many of ms.

 for the first minutes empire really itself up it appears to be a strong confident and relatively unknown at the time i did n't know why i thought it was but now i do one of the main problems with this film is that it is and utterly i do n't mind films with and things to prove a take brown for but they 're all so in this but that is obviously thrown in for entertainment you literally feel 
 first of all in defense of joan it must be said that rogers would have been as the young british lady who has the title role makes a picture as the here but her acting shows badly and her is better left fortunately she went on to better here it 's fred george burns and allen who get the top billing and they are excellent fans of burns & allen will be surprised at how easily they fit into 's 
 the is a small but absolutely wonderful film acted by albert and tom how in the world this tiny film attracted enough attention to five major academy award back in N is a mystery to me but it 's nice to know the academy can be guilty of a display of good taste every once in a while of course they gave the award that year to terms of after all they do n't want to be accused of showing

 the power started off looking promising but soon became boring and to watch the plot is about an ancient that takes of those who own it the idea is decent enough and this film would have been fairly entertaining had it been done better however after the first ten minutes or so it soon becomes boring we do n't get any good death scenes and have to listen to of talking at the end one of the men meets his 
 another fine effort by america 's most his knowledge on the subject of is staggering and me on more than one level accusations that lee is really just a little a who hollywood 's action system to make movies of quality is nonsense mere propaganda the very notion that lee would resort to the current climate of political in america in order to produce movies is simply false and of lee 's even go so far as to suggest that 
 another first this french movie is my introduction to the world eric perhaps i 'm a bit when i say that this is probably my last movie but i was immediately turned off by the way relies on conversations that never get to the point there is a scene in the movie where the characters discuss love that i thought was never going to end no matter how much i tried i could n't understand why is so highly regarded 
 one night at 's is one of those films that starts with an awful amount of promise but as the film goes on it becomes silly and loses it 's way big time tyler plays a woman who tries to get her own way by her body to every man she meets all of which fall under her are a few funny moments in this but they get fewer and fewer as the film into a comedy michael douglas who 
 this is a must see for movie fans but it also holds up well against mainstream movies i think we have the of the next allen budget is painfully low no special effects and they seemingly used lighting shot in digital video yet this movie hold of you and never lets go the is somewhat bizarre yet the actors and director pull it off with complete it has humor it has and it has and it all works point in

 most of the comments have been positive but i would like to add that viewers should also focus on the sets the set designer used a lot of beautiful art along with beautiful buildings doors furniture and so forth it is worth paying attention to the movie is driven by and which is very rich all the actors were cast it was like seeing old friends and it was a treat the was amusing at times but at times and

 i know it 's a and to N year but really why were they taking themselves seriously with this movie if they are going to write a plot with at least have the to make it silly it 's kind of if you watch this we have a typical family filled with characters father a war veteran who lost his wife and blames himself children trying to hard to fill the but fails with acting and a who serves no 
 i grew up watching the original tv series in the and one thing that i can tell you right away there is no comparison this film was totally ridiculous with a flying suit that was alive a that took different special effects that looked like something that a little child would create in contrast in the original characters were developed and the viewers developed a feeling for tim and uncle martin the only highlight in this film yes actually there 
 sorry did i miss something did i walk out early the first ten minutes of unusual and stories had me thinking this is going to be a classic but it was all down hill from there the acting was brilliant for what it 's worth william macy is and just gets better and better every film i watch him in but it never seemed to i was waiting for the big moment where all the stories and then suddenly it

 for those with little time on their hands i 'll sum it up quickly in one word there are a lot of good examples as to why this movie fits perfectly under that so much so that you can barely go through N minutes of screen time without seeing something completely stupid and forced upon you want a fully naked woman in the first N minutes you got it the reason she appears is so though that it really sets

 i had the good fortune of reading the book before seeing the movie it was an of a dream of gone a great potential film or big budget drama it somehow got into the hands of a who clearly took notes watching nights and without actually learning anything at all the script loses the meat of the book in favor of forced emotional notes and low i feel sorry for the actors since the characters in the book were rich 
 this is not a new film it is a of N 's queen of the and it has been significantly warning many characters appear in the credits that have been cut from the movie if you want to see this one in its original form pick up queen avoid this one at all costs as the cuts make it even than it was originally 
 it 's not really about swap out the training and it could just as easily be about or or a instead like every other derivative that flooded the market it 's about with all realities irrelevant by your with love interest standing by of course ronald reagan top to bottom in short so as a piece of it 's down to the details some of the actors are enough to things up especially the love interest brought to you by 
 for movie fans who have never heard of the book jackson 's the of hill house and have never seen the N robert production with harris this will seem pretty those of us who have it is just plain acting what was thinking computer and a further move away from jackson 's story this yourself a favor and rent the original movie it still effectively without special effects the acting is professional and readers of the book the from N 
 if you enjoy sitting in the dark both literally and for minutes then this is the movie for waste of actors resources and audience time ultimately a waste of space do n't be by the resume there is nothing of any further substance beyond it the film lacks all of the that you might expect from the plot character development the cast may perhaps take heart from the knowledge that in this instance their efforts will be entirely and given 
 if you would like to watch an example of how not to make a film then you need to watch this i myself with no film making experience could do better the script is with a weak plot and there is no effort to be seen for any structure in order to make up for this flaw you would think the action would be decent would n't you as the acting and overall together of the film is the only 
 the final season of was a roller ride of crazy this final episode does just what a previous comment says it tells us that as much as we might have thought we knew the characters we did not reaches back to season one and tells us that this show has been her of her life she says in this final episode that she changed events and people as she sees fit scott was not really with leon but he existed

 is this film a joke is it a comedy surely it is n't a serious there is no suggestion that there is any intended humor but on quite a few occasions the poor acting poor and script had the audience laughing out loud in the the plot is acceptable a promising young artist just reaching his peak shot dead by an he walks in on by mistake the killer sees the young artists work portfolio he is carrying and decides 
 there was a great film to be made about steve this was n't it washington never the most flexible of actors is totally unable to convey the great that had 's big crowd scenes are the massacre was n't like this three neat lines of children some doing into the guns of the soldiers with dead the film rapidly into if the struggle against apartheid was anything it was a black people 's struggle yet somehow we are all supposed 
 citizen x tells the story of the butcher of for a and russian serial killer who claimed N lives from the film focuses on the who pursued the killer against all odds in the face of an bureaucracy in and convenient an hbo product for the film offers a solid cast good performances the audience much of the details but plays out like a the of similar hollywood fare an even and of a serious and little known story more

 first off i really enjoyed N by this film was trash i could n't stand to watch it the was a joke the acting was a joke and the fact that N has nothing to do with N is even more a jump from to death N the harmful agent people back to life whatever this movie is n't worth the $ it cost to rent it i really enjoyed movies but this one was horrible if N is an 
 story of the community of in london who after an bomb find a royal charter that the area they live in forms part of movie works because it appeals to the fantasy a lot of us have about making up our own rules and not having to listen to them a solid cast of british especially stanley makes this more are some very nice moments in the film such as when the people have ran out of supplies and other 
 the main reason for writing this review is i found this of a great play and worthy N film a horrible movie experience if i can save someone from watching it i will have done a good new version is loaded with talent and it all goes wrong kenneth an one note set he proceeds to film the movie from every possible we see of the actors in steel on security monitors shots of their heads from N above close 
 i had heard of john but did n't know him i loved this movie i had never heard of it i just picked it up john is a in the movie he had been in real life also so he knew his part he was a throughout the movie someone else killed a man he character was blamed he is by a family who has questions and is not quite sure what to make of him all sorts of minor 
 N 's the man who knew too much is entertainment to those who prefer the N original i will say that that one is faster and however even though the american version was a big budget blockbuster i believe it the british version out of the water i think this is one of 's N small feat considering he made over N films and many of them were among the greatest of all time i find so many things to 
 i disagree in calling this a movie just because also makes an appearance i ca n't imagine this as even approaching classic that would be like calling a film the movie definitely along with a plot at times i if the script had either been dropped and or if they lost it entirely and just tried to it watching this movie reminded me of watching children and making the story up as they go characters are wooden the is taxed 
 i enjoy watching people doing especially if they do it as well as in the best scenes of this movie which takes you to a club called especially at christmas time because there also appears a santa if this is an old film and even if i have it from tv when the state movie of finland showed this in the summer of N on their own big screen i went there to check it out it 's much more 
 this film is about a group of extra black men on earth in order to create a watched it with the intent of seeing how bad it was still i was shocked at how bad it was it looked more like a film made N years ago the acting if any is bad the sets and are so fake making any college film look budget and the special effects are simple indeed dropping as others have but has to be 
 i hope this group of never 
 it to be the life of paul the it opens with him involved in a match with a the were called that because they themselves from the being forced upon the by their the point is that saul would never have been involved in we have the two men saul and the a totally character shown being down in the in a roman style house again the which saul to in the strongest possible terms looking upon the of another 
 while the film has one feature namely some striking shots the shot of the sheep hanging from the tree the scene of the on the or the scene of the leaving the village which seemed influenced by the scene when the approach in the these were more photographic than and would have been better hung on a wall in an art gallery than in a painfully film that comes in at a N minutes and from terrible dialogue extremely poor 
 the film is n't perfect by any means but despite this it is very fun and amusing to watch i am the first one to agree that victor fox is n't really that attractive and his music and style are pretty i also agree that the film has some odd and some scenes do n't work well so what if it makes you and you enjoy it who does every film have to make sense does every film have to 
 this is one strange together film you get the feeling that the bond company had to come in on this one i 'm not surprised there 's no credits on it who would want to be associated with this film the acting of all involved is and the plot around all over it all makes very little sense as i said before it looks like the bond company had to come in because it seems like there was of that 
 i was watching this movie and getting increasingly with the silly plot that was going nowhere when suddenly the story takes a turn for the worse and has an actor playing herself oh how i because it 's funny is n't it we know roberts is playing the character of and here they are in the film the joke that the character of looks a bit like roberts so plays someone how well she does this we 'll never know 
 someone says this could be offensive for not really embarrassing situations are funny first time i see this series i was in the video store people around me started laughing does n't matter the age or a teacher said that in order to guarantee the attention of someone in a book the beginning must be entertaining and the ending should n't be obvious by just reading the last page during the first minutes in the series the boy is hit 
 while in madrid i was able to see a copy of this film is amazing in it very unusual performance he gives aside from 's the film however is a a film i have ever seen in my life and at times is so poorly done it borders on i am also a fan so he was part of the reason i made such a grand effort to view the film the problem is is really only in one scene 
 i ca n't seem to find anything that is good about this why the hell would you ban when u could ban something far more practical like smoking or alcohol also the fact that its an australian program and its all set in england and everyone is british is stupid overall i think that this show is and cheap

 i have never on before but i feel i have to after watching the batman its warner brothers had the perfect series in batman in the early so what the hell are they doing trying to mess with the winning formula i feel like writing a complaint letter to the original was dark and exactly the way batman was intended to be had to mess this up with some batman of the future now they produce this the does n't 
 as of this writing john carpenter 's ' is it 's anniversary it has since spawned N a a whole mess of and every year around halloween when they do those N movies ' lists it 's always on there that 's quite amazing for a film that was made on a budget of around $ N N and featured a then almost completely unknown cast of up and coming young talent i could go on and on but the 
 absolutely horrible movie not a bad plot concept but executed bad script so it does n't even qualify for this is the kind of movie that gives a bad name 
 ok we have a film that some are calling one of the best movies ever but i 'm sitting here thinking hell the f the which there is no story the is quite plain nothing great and the acting is nothing real out standing so if you want to to be say you like it but if you have a real view say you do n't like it or if you did explain why 
 movie was as a joke and what a joke it was the film is based on a dog who is looking for el the dog outfit is so ridiculous it looks like he the patch on his hat and for some reason he shows of his by rolling up his throughout the movie mostly at night you can see how bad the lighting was they are in a car which is and they are driving in pitch black often you 
 i first came across friend ' one or two years ago while tv prior to that i 'd never watched any korean films before in my whole life so was really the first korean film i 've ever watched what a surprise i was from the beginning to end and had a great time laughing its comic style is quite different from those of the hong kong comic films which i 've been to used to all my life and 
 despite the occasionally acting and story this is a fairly compelling has the scenes with the are actually pretty some of the effects are and best of all no ill placed to from the film as too many films have in them this is n't the greatest film ever made but it actually draws you in and at least makes an attempt at character was glad i watched it 
 now days most people do n't watch classic movies such as this most of friends only watch movies from the to present most old movies like this are unique in their own way only because back when these movies were being thought of and made when ideas were fresh now people strain just to think of new ideas anyway to the movie for true fans of classic this is for you the movie is based with a investigator from scotland 
 edge of the city is another movie that owes a lot of credit to on the from it 's locations to its score to the belief that whatever trouble you may be in you can somehow right your edge also deals with ideas like loyalty and in my opinion that is where the movie does not succeed like at N minutes the movie through the establishment of relationships and ties everything up so quickly that much of it seems forced 
 did really see this movie a great christmas movie not even close and completely lacking in and heart i kept watching this movie wondering who the hell thought that pope could play the lead in this movie the woman has no and gives a completely lackluster performance was great as usual and provided the only of interesting the whole thing probably her involvement was the only reason this project was green to begin with maybe i 'm expecting too much 
 i do n't know who wrote the script for this movie but from the first moment on i was of all possible decisions they could make up in the why do they make the decision which is the most dangerous of all why do the criminals act although they managed to get a huge amount of money out of a bank and get away with it why does n't the main criminal land the helicopter shoot grab the money and 
 i would say for it 's time this movie was and yes if you have no desire to become a christian then why bother watching it i saw this movie after i had already been saved and found it to be very moving i see now they have taken these movies to another level and have created the left behind series they run a close comparison and definitely are more modern to reach people i think in order to actually 
 this movie is about basically human relations and the between them the main character is an old lady who at the of her life starts a to her past doing an analysis of how she lived her life this is because of the sons economic crisis and his intentions to put her in a nursing home it is a very honest look to some issues that we all ask ourselves at some point in life and there is plenty of 
 i 'd first heard of this show in N first and then by and of course buying the typically book then i got the it did not i 'd been hoping for years someone would make a science program with the emphasis on the of discovery rather than aliens laser gun fights and other hollywood ' you joe also for your dr. who work and the not the movie of the same name what me to write this now N 
 for fans such as myself this is the episode of episodes that made a case for why was so popular and just how good it really was ruth gordon has a field day as ever playing the crime novelist mitchell seems calls her to sign some papers making him her heir she never got over her 's death and is convinced her dead 's husband charles frank did the to tell more would be has a role as 's personal 
 there are no words to explain how bad nightmare weekend is it simply something about a computer that can change personal into silver balls that enter the victims ' mouth which them or turns them into the whole thing is so that it 's stunning there 's also a girl with personal computer in her room and the computer talks via a hand i 'm not making this stuff up the computer also controls things like cars even though there 
 i just finished this movie and my only comment is oh is ok as the but butler as the female dance is pure sexual having watched her in i was not prepared for the pure and raw sexual excitement she onto the got see this movie again if only for butler as 
 released in english under many titles and the of them certainly is the midnight show is one of the best italian of the to really appreciate this film you should have a sense of humor is at the same time but and sometimes even an art student goes to an old church to see the she 's going to restore it 's a wooden of a maybe already overcome by evil or fighting against it or perhaps planning dark the 
 a lot has been said about society as the first true film and i thought this sort of might have been a but like all it is based on the truth all the are here the violence the black the the testing and the difficult to like central character is however one of 's most perfectly formed films he says in an interview that if he made it again it would be different but not necessarily better i think what 
 is not a bad movie but the acting and the can be better i like this movie because i have a life that is in good part like the one in the movie is hard for a lost generation to get a life in and N percent of us choose something else and that something else includes dealing with people with bad habits if you understand me but that comes with the territory this movie represent me and i like 
 this movie is completely ridiculous not only is the plot but the acting is the special effects are and the entire movie is set in a desert yet it is by far the most amusing movie ever given permission to be produced it is N minutes of due to the fact that we all know there will be no fuel in the year N or any el 's there are also other aspects which i will not just because they 
 with an absolutely amazing cast and crew this might have been a classic instead it is a of all the conspiracy theories in N about the assassination rather on to a plot about the murder of president in many character actors are wasted as they are either not given enough to do sterling or eli for instance or they are asked to go rather over the top john jeff bridges and anthony do manage to themselves very well in their 
 i 'm on the opposite end of the previous of all i do n't think this was intended to be a straight to the i mean it 's not titled the N it 's the too which leads me to believe that while a lot of the character names are the same it actually around a completely different about it virtually no connection to the previous movie other than character names a totally different story different cast and the fact 
 as a helpful warning for others i believe man is actually worse than island i have been using as an example of the worst original movie presented on the channel but is the most and designed movie i have yet seen yes i did watch almost the whole thing coming into it about N minutes into it it drew me in with its pure what was thinking once man and the surviving leader or whatever he was i 'm not 
 readers i 've found in my studies of movies that whenever michael bay makes a movie people pan it and hate it yet they still go to see it and it makes somewhere around N million dollars why because michael bay is one of the top five directors of all time standing alongside ridley scott and michael bay has himself as hollywood 's best director that point is proved with his most film the size of texas is the planet 
 not good rent or buy the original watch this only if someone has a gun to your head and then is like claiming an actor is as good as the real king 
 a film crew is shooting a movie in an old supposedly house where over the years seven people have died one of the crew finds an old book of and it looks like it would be perfect to use in some of the scenes in their movie it is that the in the book are better written than the script they are using but as the book is read the outside suddenly comes to life now the cast and crew 
 considering john apparently inspired 's i was expecting its pilot to be quite interesting however i probably had too high expectations because i was quite disappointed by it first they turned the into a who had the crazy idea of showing off his amazing knowledge in front of an audience in a public area so after that scene i began to worry that it was just entertainment but the problem is that it got worse as none of the other 
 i can appreciate what barney is trying to achieve but after sitting through this last night at a college movie house i could n't help but think when is this end a very long and two hours and minutes i had only seen a part of N on and thought i knew what to expect that said experimental films such as this are better in small there are a couple of images including the title no but if you go 
 i ended up this movie but it was not the to get through what makes the movie great is the music and the the are beautiful and the musicians are a great job was done to show different for the the was not enough a more in history of the people would have been nice only a fraction of the of the spoken words were given english in addition more about the and who was their and some of their 
 the is yet another bad with phony special effects and a big cast of on screen and has no except maybe for the are n't all bad but directed by definitely that the actors zeta jones owen wilson are there to us from the boring plot ridiculous special effects and terrible attempts at scaring it 's audience however this is a movie not a tabloid magazine we do n't care whose in it we care about the characters and story 
 warning contains i have this adult friend for whom the notion that her parents have sex makes her uneasy she came to mind when i reflected on the audience 's reaction to the mother people when may anne in bed with her younger daniel craig or later saw explicit drawings by may i doubt the audience was at the or the drawings ' content as much as feeling uneasy at seeing a woman in her enjoying my beautiful my son 
 i know that the john hughes movies of the were all flat so the expectations for this film ran pretty after sitting through this there 's one key thing i ca n't seem to get out of my head i just sat through an lowe movie that had no and only hints of sex in acting is awful the characters boring and flat the portrayal of an and the scenes and you 've got some ally or pays or i 
 joseph 's novel heart of was in the N movie i have read 's novel and i must say even though i prefer the novel itself the movie was a great the set and designs brought 's novel to life on the screen as we followed 's the acting also brought the characters to life through the voices and if you have read the novel i recommend that you also view this movie if you have not read the novel 
 this one is about a who a couple of young rich kids who have nothing better to do than plan an murder and cover it up they seem to the police force seemingly at will they the by clues and leading them off on a wild chase this one has a decent plot with a few good at the end of the movie bullock does a fine job in this one as a woman on the edge not sure of 
 when i first watched this movie i thought it was a very strange movie but i know that the director almost always has a purpose when he makes a movie so i decided to watch it one more time the second time i watched it i that albert is a very and a very original film maker in the beginning the was told that the movie took place a decade after the fall of the communism in the eastern europe 
 what a a very made film that has so much and a factor that a lot of romantic lack is acted by walter while 's is better than i have seen her in those films opposite tom as the young struggling to be do n't need to be a young woman to understand 's struggle and feel sympathetic for her immediately and as a young man it 's easy to understand what must have gone through ed 's tim mind 
 with this movie it 's all about style atmosphere and acting true i did n't believe all of the plot developments but it did n't the acting the unexpected plot and the wonderful atmosphere me right in and carried me along for the ride and i had a great time kenneth is not only a great actor but a master of and he proves it once again with a georgia he 's surrounded by so much talent in supporting roles 
 ghost story that will give you the and some pretty fair along the way the story slowly building atmosphere all the way until you 're ready to see the woman in black you wo n't forget her once you 've seen her no no no just a story that is best viewed at night with the lights out 
 this film is pure ' it is based upon a novel called too narrow not too deep ' by richard sale which may or may not have been interesting it would take research to find out the story in the film takes for granted many incidents and much background which obviously existed in the novel but are nowhere to be seen in the film so either the film was cut or the was a mess from the start there is 
 while i certainly consider the to be a classic i have to admit that i do n't hold it in quite as high regard as many other fans do as a consequence of that i have n't seen many of the and if is anything to go by i 'll have to say that 's a good thing as this film is boring as hell and certainly not worth spending minutes on it in fairness to the other this is 
 ultimately too silly and yes there is the but probably most kids would miss that is as we have come to expect the could best be described as thin but although the ending seemed to is a reflection of the world above and somehow wealth and money seem to count for a lot there too oh yes and there 's a romantic interest with the female being the more and of the pair this in itself is rapidly becoming a 
 i do n't care what anyone says this movie was the only thing it had going for it was camera work which was very well done as for the dialogue i have heard so many people talk about it too yes it was honest and true to life but so what i can hear anyone talk like that on the street or in a fast food joint what made the dialogue good in movies like pulp and park was the 
 back in N eric monte made the classic show good times has always been my favorite and i love watching the reruns on land walker always seemed to be the star and not john most of the time felt a little of walker 's popularity winning millions of fans time to sit and watch good times the show would have been dead if have been there to save it with his always aid attitude drinking aid was like his favorite 
 when i saw this as a child it answered all of my questions and any fears or that i had it is easy to watch because it is which makes it it has no moral bias or aspects so nobody should have any objections to it it is a film that simply gives the facts of in a reassuring way i hope to show it to my daughter 
 i like a movie that has at least a of a story this does n't occur in this movie it 's a series of with no are scenes of a person collecting cans a woman with a never her sun this woman at other people at the beginning of the movie and we never find out why she disappears completely after about N minutes there is another woman who a man 's apartment there are endless scenes at a fast 
 as an ordinary i ca n't say i enjoyed watching this one it 's not too emotional for a drama not too for a not too fast for an action plus some moments of the movie are hardly credible ok i understand soldiers become a bit out of their mind out there but it 's hard to believe that a person would risk his life into the middle of a hostile city and after being shouted at by a professor 
 this is a of the classic from the N 's and this one is even better and are all back as the knight in their the boomers the is the characters are and the action rocks is a singer in her regular job so the series features some wonderful as well there is a fair amount of violence but most of it is against robots and there is some fan service but nothing too the also have many including which 
 being quite a fan of charlie following good after seeing first gold rush ' and then lights ' i was eager to see great dictator ' as i had been told this was his best film i was also at the fact it was a my first one start is typical and proof that when it comes to sound can cut it not solely relying on music to set mood and to do the talking it 's funny well and 
 this is the earth of series it has with a few exceptions all the that doomed that movie and will follow it to the grave in the turkey cemetery they are both of books with a endless amount of pages who has been turned to a complete mess by a script writer and a director in this case they are the same person who clearly do n't know what they are doing they have both a messiah that do n't 
 i recently started watching this show and i have to say that it really made me you have to appreciate the aspects of it along with everything else some other people said this show should have more realistic reactions of the dead among other things if you are going accept that can bring the dead back to life you have to accept that the other completely crazy of the show i could n't help smiling after every episode i watched 
 a romantic war story that should have got more exposure the pilot who played piano gives a touch to the story the flying may not have been enough for aviation like myself but then again this really is n't an action movie though it does not have anything in common with the james novel the that became the movie about korean war pilots dark blue world had a similar feel but with more of a romantic element to it better 
 from the opening drum hit of we 're to the last hit of whole love this set might be one of the best music 's ever to hit the shelves since the was finally released earlier this of the best things about this is that on N a whole concert and many television appearances can be found for instance the whole royal albert hall concert is on the as well as some of the best performances from the band 's 
 this was a great movie it had one plus there were some very intense drama scenes which might make it inappropriate for younger viewers under a under the radar film the acting was quite and touched down in our family room for a near perfect landing it held the attention of our whole family and we were kind of sorry to see it movie had elements of spy kids with young people saving the day but was given a somewhat 
 it all depends on how you look at it are either to or to hell says the in the polish brothers ' film is an ambitious one that will make any to sit up provided he or she has patience and basic knowledge of the of entertainment the film provide takes a beyond the and absurd that is obvious to a less obvious and commentary that ought to a american to reflect on current social values the film 's adoption 
 this movie is really there is really nothing nice i can say about it besides the moral truth expressed in the film 's concerning people in the neighborhood participating in the fight against crime besides all that the film had nothing no good shots no good acting and no good script i give this film a f and a N out N 
 i have passed several times on watching this since i figured it was some dated romantic comedy well it is a romantic comedy and maybe a little dated however it is not overly as it does on themes of office politics and you think you know exactly where things are headed but there is an element of that keeps your interest and not everything turns out quite as you had expected but there is enough and to touch the most 
 i was very disappointed in this film the director has shown some talent in his other but this just seemed to be there may have been a deep meaning behind it but it seems to me to be nothing but a director who has access to some would highly recommend his other works to people but certainly not this one as i watched it i kept on thinking it would pick up after an initial slow period but it never 
 the stars jerry as a tv host called jerry but it s not the jerry show his guests are trash but not the trash you get on the jerry show they attack one another but not like on what is the point of making a movie about the jerry show and it s not the jerry show and on top of that this is a very boring film 
 god i have i think this is a movie about a guy who rises and falls whatever it 's a stupid it does n't make any difference there 's this guy who buildings or something it does n't matter he is this who i think there is a car but i watched this in so who car and heroes who struggle back from them like a to me likes someone but he maria de is beautiful with a face then 
 this is a stupid movie when i saw it in a movie theater more than half the audience left before it was half over i stayed to the bitter end to show i caught it again on television and it was much still by no means a classic or even consistently but the family grew on me i love anyway if you 've nothing better to do and it 's free on you could do worse 
 you ca n't even make it past the first three minutes and this is coming from a huge fan N 
 this little picture played at the & N festival it is a wonderful and look at harry using many famous faces who sit for interviews rarely seen tv performances and of at work there 's even a few shots from son of this movie is the final and to one of the voices the most and the man in popular music it 's a crime that this man 's name is not as well known as some of the he

 this was made in N for what happened to our state of the art special effects what happened to our rough around the but still good actors the actors in this movie were horrible there was one or two that were n't bad but the rest down could n't stand listening to the badly written dialogue i mean who the wrote that script please do n't ever write again special effects do n't even get me started on the special 
 i felt like i needed to off after watching this one but maybe there were other reasons that i will leave to your i felt used and abused after i mean watching this film thick and well everything describes this movie but it was N you ca n't call it in the and without the a this but as a piece of from italy 's rich it definitely has a place in my library the copy i have is in 
 well how can i without to ok here goes the scripts are with each episode offering so much entertainment drama and sheer the casting is perfect especially that of the blue lady played by virginia each character has a that just is n't there on the star think having an australian spin on the show makes this for me australia has been knocking out quality films for years and is no have only seen the first four episodes in order 
 in conception a film investigating the that occur in family life in the setting of island off the coast of british columbia lotus is by the fact that it has been packaged as a movie itself throughout by the addition of music over potentially powerful scenes as if to get ready for the of commercials a really

 i wish that show would come back on television it was the greatest show ever they should make episodes between the other episodes but of course that would be confusing but i wish it would come back and make more episodes please come back the show was absolutely you could n't without seeing an episode there is a really funny part in every episode and plus the show was so much better when and were going out with each other

 this movie is great fun to watch if you love films of the organized crime variety those looking for a crime film a lead with dreams of taking over in a bad way may be slightly disappointed with the way this film is a fun through a criminal however and if you are n't familiar with hong kong films then you may be surprised by this one i was somewhat disappointed by some of the choices made but overall a 
 the movie was supposed to release in N and was much due to the but it finally released in N after the producer movie is good in parts but overall is n't scenes between and are but the other scenes are not well film is too similar to hollywood and though this was planned before that got released first so is overall after is good but too many looks and his appearance gives away that the film was delayed and 
 i heard many stories about this film being great well i took my chance when i saw it for a cheap price at last watched it and i have only a few comments about it N terrible N terrible acting N bad i never seen any worse movie in my life so far when the is bad than at least make the fights something more interesting but both are done bad the only positive thing about this movie in my 
 this is the most film i have ever seen i first saw it as a child and even thinking about it now really me i know it was set in a time when life was hard and i know these people were poor and the crops were vital yes i get all that what i find hard to take is i ca n't remember one single light moment in the entire film maybe it was true to life i do 
 these things have been floating around in my head for damn near N years now some pieces of this work were really love to see another more current example of stuff actually i 'd love to be part of i 'd would of had the chance to just say what i wanted and it i would n't have to write all this extra in order to make N lines if text as this requires i mean really this almost me 
 if you ever plan on hopefully not buying this movie think again it was as if gary had a gun to his head and was forced to act or die i only wonder if was arrested for something and was sentenced to play in this movie because i just do n't see the guy that acted so much better with in point break play in this disaster it was a movie but there are thousands of other movies that make

 i watched primarily for the presence of michael as i enjoyed his portrayal on star but had never seen him out of his makeup appears to have a nice presence and probably has the potential for a profitable acting career this movie however gave him little dramatic challenge except to prove that he can indeed use the f appears that this movie was made by someone who himself as a type with a social for today the themes are so 
 i think is a great and a very funny movie the story is so funny the daughter brings her father in some very embarrassing situations in an effort to the boy of her dreams the daughter that her father is her just have to see is lovely as perhaps too lovely i 'm not sure why she 'd need to lie to hook anyone gerard acts very great in this comedy film he is so fun to watch if you 
 the only reason to see this film is sung lee the stunning from korea who plays give me a break in this otherwise movie she is given a fairly substantial part in this film and seems to handle it well though none of the parts is really interesting or well written even for a national 's movie it 's really stupid stupid humor is one thing but just stupid is another i may have once and that was probably just

 this was the film that first indicated to me what a great actor martin really is he modestly claims that charlie is a better actor charlie ca n't hold a to found it and enjoyed the of the love story with the main plot and i usually hate love stories there 's a great plot twist at the end that struck me as being fully credible particularly in the early N 's time period and probably now final scene had 
 this film is an to the play upon which it is based the character of has been beyond recognition leaving a painful performance that does not even resemble the original plot shame shame shame they have also cut a fair number of the original score of change the context in which the are sung this the air of the film and causes the who is aware of how this should be to as the writer of this screen play gives

 i searched video store everywhere to find this movie being the huge fan that i am and i found it to be a huge disappointment kurt had most of the moves down and the voice was great but the dubbed in voice of just work for me the voice always match up with mouth and it was hard for me to get lost in the plot because it bothered me that it was also there were so many discrepancies in 
 the main for this movie is every woman 's fantasy a that and men well at least it is a fantasy for every woman who has ever had a fight against a man what 's that of women but do n't worry it 's not a kind of eating of men it 's more like a them in like a drain plug there 's no blood or parts left behind so for blood & fans forget about this film not 
 this film broke a lot of ground and receives on the whole a lot less credit than it 's due it on a topic that is in our daily lives but which is seen as a phenomenon so common that it does not merit discussion this phenomenon is that of be they doctors or as in broken promise a senior social worker who abuse their position in order to harm those they have been charged to broken promise and her 
 i think its pretty safe to say that this is the worst film ever made when i saw the on tv i knew right from second N that this would be a piece of and it would be best to avoid it but i somehow got dragged into seeing this by some friends i walked into the with low expectations but i was hoping there would be a couple of cheap to keep me during this film the so-called jokes 
 i found this to be a that has a nice ending and a generally nice feel to it it 's not a hall of family film with considered normal behavior but considering it stars and robert de i would have expected a lot movie at least the most part of the film is the portrayal of how difficult it must be to learn how to read and write when you are already an adult that 's the big theme of

 i really enjoyed this movie most of the reviews have been bad but most critics think a movie should be like an idea drama this movie has a little bit of drama but the rest is just clean fun and very entertaining forget about roberts being a pretty woman roberts is a beautiful young lady and there is more to her than just that was so much fun to watch in the role of nancy drew it is good to

 after i got done watching this movie i was so upset that i had wasted N hours of my life that 's N hours i 'll never get back when you start this you might think this is really good but rest assured that first mean nothing i was so excited about this movie until the ending i have ever seen this movie is simply the acting is the story line is anything but original and there 's nothing especially 
 it is a wonderful film about people strange people the characters in the movie all have a very past so they all have their problems their problems in a way that makes the plot of the movie very absurd but that does not make the movie worse only better for it is shot in a kind of way so nothing is real this review might sound a little weird but then again the movie is not quite normal it is 
 it is one of the better indian movies i have seen lately instead of song and dance or dog movies all the actors have showed the right at the right intensity with right timing it is the of a good movie that it make the go back and research the subject which exactly what i did checking on i always enjoy 's style of acting and he had rather a complicated relationship with his own father not as dramatic as

 lost is an extremely well made tv series about some people that are lost on an island there 's so many and turns that you ca n't really decide who your character is one minute its him then he does something so he 's then about to do something so the then builds up and just as you are about to burst the episode ends and your like so you have to wait a whole week too see the next 
 after watching this movie on i watched the the describes the movie as well there 's and there 's there was really only one part of the film that seemed to me but frankly it was more confusing than the other unusual particularly the scene where everybody is on the floor were so they had no meaning i do n't mind that does n't mean anything but these scenes just seemed impression is that the director was trying to convey

 this movie is very good in term of acting and plot the events and the setting how chris gets the job chris 's work environment the face-to-face between the two sides etc on the other hand are found to be less than realistic 
 to put it simply i am not of and having never sat through one from beginning to end i decided to watch my and see it all the way through no matter how painful it was for me at first it was as expected i found the acting to be the your standard horses and cowboys boring and the music and its timing on the edge of painful however after talking myself to struggle on after the first N minutes 
 somewhere out there there must be a list of the all time worst films every made one 's that have camera shots of the stars sitting and into space or one 's where they focus long on eating this motion picture is a story of a boy and a boy and they live and love and and get stuck in and one of them has a depressed mother and another has no mother and they talk and walk and and

 i could n't make sense of this film much of the time and neither could anyone else based on other reviews the opening scene of this film has virtually nothing to do with the rest of the story in it a with a big his vacation to get away from his girlfriend he is assigned to photograph a mountain range it 's rumored to be but i could n't tell whether he heard that from his boss or later in

 old movie will know why i 'd call this one the man in the grey most movies are basically what might call forth and here is how peck tries to raise on a variety of psychological and social issues with the carrying all about him as a great it falls flat as bread but there is something about this movie of all the big hollywood pictures it most the attitude of the average american belief in the god sunday 's

 what a piece of stupid wo n't even waste time evaluating any of the points of this show it 's not worth the time the one comment i will make is why get such a to be the star there are n't many more dismal to the deteriorating mental condition of the networks than the fact that fox has stated it will not bring back john a decent series but will bring back like joe for yet another round of

 context is everything when one goes to rate a movie when rating this movie one has to consider the time in which it was made we did n't really know what the inside of the earth was in those days so you ca n't on the movie too much for the plot based on a much older book for the era this was top special effects and the production quality was great i watched this movie in a restored master

 this was a film based on the novel written by the modern literary god that is i refuse to believe that studio bought the rights to this movie for anything using the ' name ever since my sight became poor enough to require large print i have been unable to read this book as i had at least twice a year since first reading it i missed the book greatly and was unable to find it in large was hoping

 i have just caught this movie on and can understand why george murphy went into politics if this was the best mgm could serve up to him it is so that the attempt to make it a real effort does not come off it featured two of my in completely wasted and dean the best actor in the film but what really hit me was that the leading lady went through some N minutes it seemed longer without changing the 
 this film is just as bad as the of i do not refer to the acting but rather the of both films which try to criminals as figures moreover it me when well respected actors like alan and burt lancaster play such roles because their status tends to lend credibility to the director 's intent to the film 's subject a was in junior high school during the last years of 's life and his death penalty appeals and books 
 still being of school age and having to learn shakespeare almost constantly for the last four years which is very of any writer no matter how good i did n't really expect to enjoy this film when my english teacher put it on i thought it 'd be the typical english lesson movie bad acting shot badly and the awful old so as you can tell i was all but ready to go into a from the go however i 
 would star again as the harry but would also direct the fourth entry in the harry ' series impact ' again like the other additions brings its own style and tone but if anything it 's probably the most similar to the original in it 's and moments and a classic line go ahead make my day but some of its humor has to been seen to believe a named that and oh however an interesting fact this entry was 
 some have on the not being a problem in this film i to differ the in the and between the characters is such that you can not afford to take your eyes away for even a fraction of a second i tried to watch on the in english to overcome this problem do n't make this mistake the result is a the only way to get the full benefit is to watch it two or three times in quick succession 
 well of course not women are overly sensitive and on average which is portrayed from mother to though not or on unlike many of you i have only seen la la twice as many good films i noticed my opinion of it improved after a second all that i know is what i have seen and have yet to into further until i myself have acquired the i have yet to figure out precisely why i enjoy this movie so 
 one of the most of american opens the film by with his open mouth on a we wonder is he coming off a high we just see his face then his body his naked rear i ca n't think of another film that used this form of so well to create a mood an method that works as both and style after that introduction when opens his mouth his is we expect him to be some kind of instead he 
 i ca n't believe that this film is n't more highly rated could be described as something like a french alfred and while this film is only the second one of his that i 've seen the first being i can already see that this guy is something special just on the strength of these two films the film is a french and canadian and takes place in canada the cast is made up of british and canadian stars and 
 i am proud of ' mike has said he should be because this film which either has been by many of us or studied and by film professors works on many it 's to many frustrating it 's almost as if the producers hand you the film and you figure it out you probably already know that the tv show was a runaway marketing success that depended upon business and no small serving of public tv shows are about selling 
 i was N years old when i saw first saw this film in the theater i have a vivid memory of a different ending not completely different but significantly i just watched the movie last night and i was wrong so i guess the following ca n't be called a since it never happened the ending i remember was that the boy was in the house completely naked found him quite easily and after she confronted him she slowly sank 
 the only way i can feel good about having handed over these precious minutes of my life is everyday telling someone how awful it was and even if i say it once a day every day for the rest of my life i will not fully get my point across just 's a difference in movies like this and movies like elephant or fat guy goes two of my other least favorite movies the latter two were terrible yes but 
 this film is the worst film i have ever seen the story line is weak i could n't even follow it the acting is the sound track is the attempts at humor are not the is horrible the credits are even slow i would be embarrassed to have my name associated with this waste of film do n't waste your time even thinking about this attempt at acting 
 acting was weak but in a i can live with that if the story is good it was n't the initial event was an and obvious to exploit most people 's of kids ok fine fast forward to the place in the country where they will recover i like the of the ghosts ok cool this will be a story with things partly in our world partly in where ever then the action starts pulling like a three headed dog 
 i just finished watching going i have to say that we should send every copy of this film to and make them watch i even tried to get a blind women to watch this and she turned it off in like N could not find a better project than this as for the writing if what you want to call it those responsible should be forced to watch this movie forever in hell i believe that somewhere i read that 
 planet represents the kind of science that is precious in especially from the there was the day the earth stood still and war of the but not forget this which took some of its story from shakespeare 's the to tell a tale of on a planet that has a doctor on it who has made a remarkable it 's the kind of that is not so much incredible to look at though for N it does look quite amazing 
 this is one of bruce 's most films in my opinion its an film with a neat story and an amazing performance from bruce all the characters are great and i thought and spencer were just together plus bruce is simply amazing in this this is definitely one of bruce 's best performances the thing was great and i thought it was very well written and made as well plus the is especially cool it 's good and it was 
 possibly john best film to date and definitely his seymour plays the young with wife of excellent as usual a must see of a film if you can it 
 i have watched this movie a few times and never really thought it was that funny but it 's still fun to watch and good for a few about women that work at a company and their boss is a and they end up giving him a taste of his own medicine and try to get the respect they acting is really good coleman is one of those N 's stars that plays a good bad guy not really evil 
 i wonder if there is any sense of sense in this movie its a big joke good its entertaining you get to see the most stupid plot played very seriously in the form of a film i wonder which audience group this movie is basically targeted a pros plays a mom for a happy couple who want a child but ca n't i wonder how it would be if this drama was a from a real couple 's appears happy 
 as much as we might welcome a film that deals with people who have different challenges in the area of i can not shake off the feeling that this movie was intended as a movie in which either a the actors backed out of doing the explicit scenes or b the producers ran out of money to hire for the an amazing thing if it were true had to go back to blockbuster to figure out why on earth i 
 is a movie that sort of caught me by surprise a sort of drama that focuses on a man writing a play about his life that are happening to him right at this moment to be more he feels that his wife is cheating on him so he a private eye to on him his wife has no idea that this is happening meanwhile the actors in this play are also having a few up their by around with each 
 i watched this movie last night on one of the channels and while watching it i quickly why i bothered in all honesty i really did expect something more from this film maybe something along the lines of theory ' why maybe because of the casting i mean and after all not to mention jon and christopher now i 'm wondering why did they bother but instead of an action mystery drama i was caught up in a of a

 some people like to tell you that deep space N is the best of all the star shows because it character development and and features a more complex background and ongoing in some ways this makes it more satisfying but in many ways the show fails series starts out as a soap opera on a space station with two entire seasons of generic science stories balanced with about the characters the characters are a good bunch and most of the 
 peter version s are better films overall from objective point of view that being said they are not my favorite screen versions of lord of the and let me explain why the acting of the characters is just too ordinary and with jackson 's the whole cast is too run of the mill are you claiming that those silly characters of ralph version are better actors than real people one could ask well they are not really silly save for

 this was one of the best funny road movies ever i so i fell out of the chair with many norwegian and foreign playing themselves is the producer known for films like agent banks and of course one night at is about norwegian crazy fans going to the world cup in in germany and all sort of crazy fun that comes with it it was i could n't stop laughing i have n't had so much fun in ages rumors 
 when i i was expecting a movie the box even claimed that the movie had extreme scenes of violence that were cut from the theatrical release i now have serious doubts about this being released in the theater after finishing the movie i how it could even receive a video plot is as follows a group of three young women on a car trip crash their car into a tree these women somehow manage to make their way to a 
 i saw this film at the new festival in new york it was by far the worst film there it 's use of full and a script and direction that neither to a of ' nor decides it 's a neil left me feeling would anyone a perfectly good cast like this ' it lacks irony and the vacuum with sentiment which causes the times when the movie turns on itself to make you want to wipe your face as 
 this movie was really bad you talk about typical movie plot watching this movie was like hitting my head repeatedly against a brick wall the kept trying to be cool but failed the plot twist at the end where we find out who the bad guy is was unexpected but does n't make much sense until his even then the amount of in this movie does n't help either are all of those images necessary my last complaint is about

 imagine what it must have been like for john one of hollywood 's leading men married to temple for five years he finds himself doing movies like this i remember him in where he was n't half bad unfortunately there is nothing to recommend this film the monster is and incompetent the police are boring the are boring the plot is stupid people run around there are events that do nothing to advance the plot there 's that goes on

 when i went to watch this movie my expectations were really low but i was surprised i thought i was going to watch a boring but in fact the plot is interesting and well executed the acting was somewhat convincing especially from who really shows his talent in this movie and the fight scenes were for a low budget movie very well done think this movie deserves a broader audience than it has received it is a movie which can

 this movie is actually so poor in its desperate attempts at being feel good and casual it really made me embarrassed watching it i ca n't imagine how the inner circle of norwegian and press must have felt trying to to like it at the premiere its great media reviews is a example of how small and the norwegian media scene is had a foreign film of this quality reached the silver screen it would have gotten the rain of 
 this is quite an unusual and unique little western that is made mostly original due to its story that around an unique and superior N and all of those who get to it at one point or another in the 's mostly a very entertaining movie to watch but not without still being a real western as well the movie got done in a typical 's style of western so the of the should not be turned off by its

 great movie and the family will love it if kids are one day just pop the tape in and you 'll be so glad you did 
 anything that might have been potentially interesting in this material is in the first few seconds with a that the events we 're about to see ca n't ever be known and this is the rumor most often told about one of hollywood 's most so we 're not getting anything new and e 's & scandals gives you a better on the particular incident and that 's not much of an endorsement what do we get we learn that 
 after what i thought was a performance of two roles in man from river why was kirk douglas replaced by brian in the it just was n't the same without spur and harrison as portrayed by douglas maybe he recognized how poor the plot was jim returns after extended absence to find being pursued by another man he could not expect any girl to wait that long with no contact from him and not find competition for a disney movie 
 actually it was pretty funny in a god how the hell did this movie get made kind of way if you life making fun of movies which i do go ahead and watch it but if you 're actually thinking is this a good movie movie from the very beginning scene with the worst acting i 've ever seen in any movie usually they get five minutes into it before you realize this movie might but no you know right

 i once heard this movie described as either you 'll love it or you 'll hate it from reading some of the other reviews and the ratings i would venture to say that this is true i am placing myself in the hate it crowd i have seen some truly bad movies boring movies and even low budget movies this movie is bad on all three island earth 's jeff returns to his roots as dr. minus giant head the

 personally i absolutely love this movie and novel i read the book first and decided to see the movie first of all the plot is truly original and one of a kind the acting is also great and i love the cast crandall plays fred fits his role perfectly and really sells it to you there are also a few lines thrown in there if they were meant to be but they really will up the mood and provide a

 in cold blood is directed and adapted by richard brooks however it 's also so on being realistic it 's sometimes more clinical than entertaining the killing of a midwest family author focused on himself and the reader up in the subject and subjects brooks wildly from that approach in favor of something closer to although he films on actual locations he keeps his distance the are portrayed as which surely they were they 're not seen as as in 
 i usually give the benefit of the doubt and go easy on them but this is very poor the exact same as what happened in the first film happens here again the exact same only they wanted younger kids to be able see it this accounts for the repeated presence of bugs bunny but why they threw in one ' f ' is beyond me did n't even bother to change mason 's character from 's let me explain in 
 it 's almost impossible for me to sit down and write a review of three colors red without letting people in on some of the ideas that has in the previous two to this the more i see them and think of them and imagine myself in their world the more i get its theme that we are more linked to each other than we would want to think ourselves and all it takes is a little hand of fate

 i have not read a time to kill by john and perhaps that would have helped understand the film better but perhaps not i hear this is the most yet and if that is true i can see why so many publishers turned down the novel when introduced it as his first work a time to kill is one of those films that is seriously confused and wants to do too many things at once it wants to be a 
 well no not really its not really a good movie but its not as bad as i thought it was going to be i really did n't feel off of my rental money and sometimes all you can ask for the plot is ok nothing brilliant or new the acting is pretty bad but the cast is pretty the is but the effects are horrible especially the effects which in a movie is a pretty big problem there was a 
 this movie starts out very very slow but when the action finally gets started it 's a little had to follow i could n't understand why some of the events were taking place and a lot of events happened before they were explained making them sort of confusing the only thing it really has going for it is the massive amount of it has although most times the special effects are lacking blood looks like red skin sounds like somebody 
 somehow this about miles manages to include very little music and no complete though miles appears in the film N of the interviews are other folks not miles there are huge many aspects of his life his his drug are or over and you 'll learn little about what made the man and his contribution to music so it 
 i 'm not a big fan of as a but even by the standards of this one is really even on a level it 's boring there is some of both but it 's all sort of before the home video revolution it might not even have been released though it might have after all plan N from outer space played in theaters there is precisely one good and line in the entire movie i assume they it from acting 
 do n't get me wrong the guy 's a success but he got to the top by selling plastic toys to so i get a little when he looks at comic book fans as an extension of that same the iron man would n't be bad if it were on a saturday morning and geared exclusively toward children but it 's not directed exclusively at children characters are killed every five minutes and there 's enough and bodies to make 
 forget the comments that come before these this is an action packed but sensitive movie about people who overcome real problems in a beautiful setting even by elizabeth recommended for anyone who wants to feel something and experience change

 i guess this would be a great movie for a true in organized christian but for anyone with an open mind who believes in free will rational thinking the separation of church & state and good science it is a terrible joke there are some well known actors who were either badly in need of work or had a need to share their personal with the rest of us was by this movie in the same way i was by

 the fact that this film was shown at london 's suggests to me that the print must have been acceptable enough for such a showing now the question is why is n't this long lost and important film available in or even a large number of persons in europe and the usa have for many years hoped to see this film if for no other reason than the wonderful music written for it by what does one have to do

 when you read the comment on this film that it 's smart and funny political comedy based on true events the only true word here is that it 's a comedy if you 're told it 's insider movie about russian politics it 's not there 's probably only N in the movie from what really happened in russia during that in reality of the N it was thousand times more interesting to follow the situation and that was a 
 and i thought the beach was bad with the difference that this movie has one of the greatest actors of our time do n't blame him for the awful script if any one can make any sense of what the hell was the point of that movie give your a pat on the back its a cross between the village and a script its starts off catching your eye and then as it goes further into the plot it just

 why this film was only released in N states is beyond me i thought this film was a story the name says it all seeing other people this movie has more logic than which i is why it works so well common sense also makes an appearance in what would seem to be another sex comedy alice is getting her feet frozen in the cold when she feels about the way she might perform for her not just but as 
 this may have been made for the hell of it but it was most probably the worst film i 've seen in years the best thing about the entire would be the case i 'm surprised that people took the time to make something so and yet spend money on it too i 'm glad i only i the real fans of this film would probably have to be and to care about it without taking in any or any 
 it 's one of the best movies that i have seen this year i do n't agree with the person who said it 's boring of course some people may find this movie not at all but personally i spent a very good moment this movie very well sex scenes with scenes there is also a nice touch of humor for example when the wife tells her husband that in her she was abused by her father and then her 
 was the film that moved from the to the big league james stewart 's career in the process by casting him as a hero although since he inherited the project from lang maybe lang deserves the credit for that both men would go to much places with the bleak 's which remained by mgm until the success of broken arrow convinced them to release it but a movie about a man hunting down his own brother as the of the 
 i saw virtually no in this movie the only thing i did see was 's for it there were some attractive women in this movie and perhaps that is one decent quality overall however i found this movie and ridiculous the hand held film making coupled with slow motion and other i found and dizzying even overall the music throughout was horrible and to the extreme as well me of psychological of the u.s. military against various various that made 
 there 's really not much need to begin this little review with a plot i mean it 's shakespeare 's for probably one of the best known plays ever written i 'm not embarrassed to admit that i came to this version of the way most people on have through mystery science theater while the show may not be the best to use to judge a movie in this case i can not imagine attempting to watch it without the 
 i like to like movies but i found nothing to like about the box i was interested in the ' of the plot but unfortunately it never went anywhere and was impossible to follow anyone who states that they understand this movie is probably it so that they can feel like they are a part of something well i have news for them the has no only in this movie is that women are to blame for original and i 
 this should have been a movie about sam and his wife the peter and equally olympia that would have been a movie worth seeing instead it 's a paul vehicle with a little thrown in the wonderful elizabeth is also in this movie but you 'd hardly know it i is under the impression that he 's a giant movie star who needs an appropriate vehicle he 's not even more is that took the trouble to hire some of 
 well if you set aside the fact that this movie features acting and if you set aside the fact that the story is and off in about five different without ever deciding which way it really wants to go and if you set aside the fact that i did n't find a single scene in this movie that was interesting well if you set all that aside this is still a really terrible movie i take it that this is 
 outside of the fact that george is a his show is about has ever been funny i have watched his and have never any to a stuff comes across as and his white people out of every single of his have at white people jokes from many a and love many of guy has a that wo n't feel bad for hispanics who have only this show to represent shows are always with an hispanic at the comments and be

 think of an extremely version of and you 've got that sums up the in a i must give credit where credit 's due though the film has a nice appeal to it i liked the i liked the wild color schemes i liked the designs but without good acting a film has no value i 'd rather watch a film with little appeal with good actors and sharp dialogue the brothers or any edward burns film the actors either 
 my got the no no as a on a tape and she to listen to it after it finally totally me into i found the to be especially the famous i want to be happy but i ca n't be happy but of from the i had no idea what the film was about so the other day i saw a copy of it at the video store and i what was supposed to be a long lost version of 
 to sat how awful the shield is you 'd have to write pages and pages so it to say that it is a to bad when directors go should have been the title of this production indeed directors are supposed to their work with a sense of style and that the story is constantly shaking the camera and playing with the lens a style how is it the story forward of course there 's also the by random numbers nonsense 
 is a place to live work and study i 've been there twice and never did i hear anything about guerrilla activities taking tourists or anything of the sort there are police but it is not a big brother system there are just enough police so that they are visible in everyday life but they do not someone without good sierra is an interesting in that the it in the movie essentially become its characters the directors of the movie 
 i have read the short story by norman and the movie did justice to norman 's writing my husband tends to it occasionally and i myself have read it over and scenes of the movie keeps coming to mind we have of many of redford movies and we have watched a river runs through it many times redford is part of the as he is always around we never get tired of redford 's perception of norman and the beauty 
 this is actually a pretty bad film the is not as as in those films collins made later however my main about the film are that it is and quite frankly boring for a long time the whole concept of an man joining for no particular reason is n't very convincing and you ca n't help wondering why a group of highly organized who later become pretty fall for it the film starts with a pretty powerful scene but then 
 fans seek out this rare film it is well written and full of all sorts of the usual low that these films i do n't want to give anything away so i even say anything about the plot the whole movie creates a very bizarre atmosphere and you do n't know what to expect or who to suspect recommended the only place i 've seen to get this film in english is from european trash for $ N 
 i thought this movie was fun i have never really watched old movies before and this one was a really great first date film it had and heart and spirit was kind of but in today 's film industry is i gave it a ten and i highly suggest buying or seeing the movie anyway you can gene kelly was very and a little bit and you knew the character thought that he was have it all the female lead 
 secret reminded me of the N with rogers and david but this korean production is a better film it korean in a korean city and the main character 's with them in the wake of a horrible personal tragedy is a single mother who moves to the city of ' in chinese from seoul with her young son she has chosen because her late husband killed in an auto accident was born there and she feels she needs to make 
 this movie something most other movies of its do not intelligence and good messages accepted is the story of a kid named justin long who gets rejected by every college he applies to his parents are strict frustrated and disappointed so and a few other students who face similar problems start a fake college to pawn themselves off to their parents as college kids not everything goes to plan and the movie is about them it but behind this plot 
 just a old movie first 's son gets his foot trapped in a really way and then her husband gets his foot trapped in another really way in an effort to save him gets yet again and comes across an escaped she has a chance to kill him but fails in a very way in the end her husband is saved and tells us through what the message of the movie is all 's well than ends could never figure 
 this version of park while being extremely accurate to the novel lacked the i felt for which is crucial and central to this story this was due to the total lack of acting ability by the actress she had no appeal and at times appeared to be either lost in space or out of her the scene she has with her uncle where she breaks down in was she badly that crucial scene and i actually felt sorry that henry 
 i chose this movie really for my works in radio broadcasting i thought that it would be more of a movie that he would enjoy and too though it was from the it was a little dated this movie really draws you in at times you just want to the host barry at times you just want to send some of the who call in to a true concentration camp at times you really feel sorry for barry because he 
 i just viewed this great of night of the living dead and i have to say it was so awful and so it was excellent this movie incorporated all the and shots that the original had including the cemetery the abandoned house the and the front lawn what i especially love about this movie is the use of bread and all the common household enemies bread has a against we know that and have done bread in a dozen times 
 in alfred 's of 's on a train guy and bruno anthony robert walker meet for the first time on a train and discuss the idea of carrying out two the rather anthony suggests that he could murder ' wife and could murder anthony 's father the lack of any connection between the and the victim in each case should ensure that both crimes would remain the of the conversation leaves the more easy going with the impression that the

 has proved himself as a very innovative and competent director he had done a of with and succeeded for which he made as is been the movie he repeatedly says has inspired him the most unfortunately he has managed to make a disappointing and ultimately boring acting ranged from decent to very good with being as the were awful and the song came off as a second rate music worst part was the and the which were the movie in 
 yes it was an awful movie but there was a song near the beginning of the movie i think called i got a or something to that effect i would love to find a sound track of that if there is one available i saw this song on and as awful as it was it had it 's moments and that song was one of you like in this is the movie for you but if you do n't then 
 i agree with in ontario i saw this movie today with a friend who actually went to the theatre manager and told him that was possibly the worst movie i have ever seen i have seen a lot of movies with this person and he 's pretty so i was actually shocked the manager gave him a free pass i was by much of the humor in the film yes the potato scene was on the top of the list 
 the title of the film seems quite appropriate given the of the lead character he 's an older man living in the late autumn of his life yet about as a school boy who 's just entered a spring the of old age and the warning signs of death are all to him his wife supports this idea when she observes at and death in other words death is not something takes too seriously he has more important things to 
 the only in this film was how it ever got made the british film industry needs to make films people actually want to watch and not look to get taxpayers money to keep in their life style they have been accustomed to with doing nothing for film was every thing wrong with british films it relied on it had to be about a london were people were either and corrupt or types the story script was just weak to the 
 of reviews for the experiment are here wonderful my name is steve and i run films we just started the guinea films on for north america now before you ask why am i writing a review instead ask why some people it i 'm writing this review because i love the guinea films why do i love it 's because they go for the and they do n't let go i 've seen it all almost every film known to 
 i did and i lost two and a half hours of my life that i can never regain have no idea what the critics and fans see in this movie and that 's not because i ca n't appreciate art i love a good film with messages brilliant and great film just is n't one of main complaint about this film is that it 's so to the point of boring its audience to death on the other hand of 
 john what have you done silver city had moments in which i could see the hope of a good story characters thought and then those moments would quickly be covered over by of poor writing direction and acting i truly love almost all of john ' work but silver city is got the feeling that may have been working on the of a good story involving the illegal labor and industrial corruption plot lines but then he got rushed and 
 there are movies that are so bad they 're good then there 's movies like rest stop that should just never have been made because they are just plain acting characters predictable plot and a supposedly twist that adds nothing to the story are all key failures some half decent special effects are about the only thing worthy of note i ca n't even bring myself to write a plot because all i really want to do here is warn 
 well recorded this because of it had stars it seemed promising it went is much even from she 's about N and playing a N year old there are three characters that are supposed to be italian everyone else is american the native italian were good i thought the young male lead is my wife says everyone else in this movie is a fat italian woman even the should have known that when dick van was cast as a doctor 
 boy this was one movie while i have n't seen all of the i can say with confidence that this is the worst this rich but ill woman taylor of course owns this beautiful island in the ruling over a staff when she 's suddenly visited by this traveling who in fact the whole film is just a talk with much of the talk making no sense even in N no one could make heads or of this nonsense and 
 i have seen several comments here about using a southern some of which felt it was a mistake when this movie was made and discrimination were very strong in the south the jim laws were still in effect civil rights was in it 's could this have possibly been a social commentary a southern man in love with a woman of another race the same way was a criticism of the nam war any thoughts another comment was made about 
 i appear to be in the minority but i thought radio was pretty awful it seemed to contain almost every in these types of for the characters falling in love with radio was never really explained we were just supposed to accept that everyone was of radio except for a couple of bad could see almost all of big moments in the story from N yards away when the movie wanted you to go or pull out your tissue i 
 i 've spent quite a while going through all the reviews for this film i 'm in total agreement with almost every in saying that 's ark is do n't the executives at nbc have any class i feel sick to my for actually watching both parts of this the script is so so and yes totally inaccurate i can understand making a few changes for dramatic purposes but this film changed just about everything in the story god himself 
 when i first heard about moon child i thought it was a joke after a few months i figured i guess it 's for real the few reviews i read that were n't made by were not very i was given the opportunity to watch it i was fully prepared to and otherwise need to close my eyes to avoid the was more than a little surprised and in a good moon child has its moments of camp and general 
 without saying how it ended it is sufficient to say that the whole thing from about five minutes before the end if the standard had been maintained throughout the movie would be worth a in a way why a woman was added to the cast well not really the is a good one the situation the victims find themselves in is pretty and it 's rather well done but you get the impression the makers of the film lost interest 
 this belongs in their top although there were others such as and that were more of than this one but if nothing else the announcement dr. howard dr. fine dr. howard followed by 's woo woo woo woo makes this a classic on two levels first it all that the represent my daughter to repeat the announcement when she is in the middle of doing something silly second the of these three as physicians in a hospital i imagine the

 oh some of the best talent in british tv made this serial and so i can only assume that they were working under incredible time pressure and had to settle for first takes of many are some scenes in this highland mystery mostly when the monster attacks and we see it from his point of view but i 'm afraid that i found most of the story funny such as the moment when the hero a on a golf course 
 this movie is based on the novel island of dr. by wells it 's a fairly good one too it 's at least better than the version by john 
 an interesting idea four african american women crushed under society 's take their by banks is by f. gary gray 's slow direction and an script by and kate full of funny moments instead of delivering a pointed commentary about the role of urban women struggling to stay afloat in a world where men abuse and them gray and prefers to their audience with of tragedy it 's at its worst gray has his actors over every tired line and 
 and one only in my reason is margaret she is a wonderful actress as well as on the screen we have few chances to see her though i think that 's especially true in the united she plays a sympathetic role not only that but she is also very pretty and meant to be something of a does not hold up the tradition of performers he is always but he 's not much fun he 's not a or a 
 the N in me is happy that they 're now able to make really good looking fantasy movies and that they 're all the rage what with lord of the harry and the of making of cash at the box office this year will see and already has seen several more most notably the golden which has the most exciting i 've seen this year based on a novel by neil showed up in theaters this week with little more 
 i happened upon this by chance i was at my friends house and he had just started watching it so i sat down thinking we would shoot the this was playing in the background however within seconds i was in this and we both spent the rest of the time completely focused on this and not saying a word to each other i never knew the tale of the the first solo around the world race let alone the events 
 many people judge it as a fan service film because a lot of star in this movie and wang lee is very famous singer in japan but do n't judge it before you watch is what i say and staff are very serious when made this film and they worked so hard it 's a good film with a touchy story inside several scenes can be so fun and some others are so sad they made it so good until 
 the summer has been so full of and of films and not to mention some of the disappointments of those that i was to find a film i could just sit down and enjoy in case you do n't want to read further down the page there are n't any i 'll sum it up here it 's more mature than there are some violent parts plenty of death and a handful of scenes with a little blood not for 
 i usually start by the of the film but before anyone makes any judgments about my review let me it by saying that i 'm someone who likes most films just check my other reviews alone in the dark is a film by director whose film right before this one was house of the dead N like alone in the dark it was also a film of a video game almost everyone it well i loved it i even gave

 this film would like to be the kind of and intense movie that many others in its have successfully been but it 's not it is at best confusing and absurd when the and turns finally revealed themselves rather than saying i get it i something along the lines of whatever in my opinion when a movie reveals a major plot twist it should n't have to employ a to prove that it did give some hints that would enable 
 big of N is a more than conclusion to the great lake 's career this has the wide reputation of being an awful and so i must say as a huge fan of especially from the i nonetheless chose to watch this mainly due to the cool picture on this site but after watching it i had to recognize that the picture actually has nothing to do with the film the picture here on this site is the cover of 
 you can put a model against a black background and call it and enough to get me interested so if you are like that black horizon will at least get you interested before you watch it the best part of the movie is when they some actual of a shuttle movie plays like the naked gun series with bad and bad acting unfortunately i do n't think they meant to be funny the actors really are made of the really 
 i bought the of before and saw it for the first time a week ago having saw it twice i could n't help but missing before not because the was not as great but i felt that these two movies completed each other like no other ever did every time i finished watching one of them i feel the need and to see the other so i ended up spending the weeks watching both of them repeatedly i will be

 this film is one of the few quality films of N and definitely one of my best the scenario is based on the novel by and the transfer to the big screen is absolutely brilliant the photography of the film is excellent as is the acting of both and watson definitely gives his best performance to date proving he 's worth much more than what we thought watson also story is about a player which is also extremely in his 
 this movie has more than any other movie i have seen in my life the special effects are terrible for instance near the end when the is falling after the cargo door off the thing like a toy the special effects of airport N are way better than this also the force of a opening up at and speed would essentially turn the thing that is if it would even open at all but the movie has its good points 
 there are a number of reviews that comment on the cast of this film it to say that alex plays a strong lead opposite robert and arthur kennedy what concerns me is that many of you may not be aware of the at least two existing versions of this film in the u.s. version gains from governor carter and then out of town redeemed i agree that ending is less than satisfying however in the original italian cut out of 
 this is not a serious film and does not to be but it is not as bad as some of its reviews it 's title and the first ten minutes lead you to plot is very silly but this adds to the fun and enthusiasm which runs through the film the characters are played and while they do engage in typical they generally avoid the usually to be found in this film set in london sympathetic to this is well 
 as i saw the movie i was really shocked to see what the N 's was about i know i may be wrong about some things but it seemed like the N 's really had an effect on people of the time some people said they would want to go back to the N 's from what i saw i would say yes for the excitement and no for the outcome but that 's my opinion 
 this superior to the original blind dead movie is another trash waste so many people have up these films that i ca n't believe what they say about it since i was a kid i have heard about how scary and great these films are and i saw them all and was disappointed was everyone on drugs from the N 's or do they just not know how boring this crude is 
 as a knowledgeable fan i recommend this film as to the facts and well acted as an N year old living in i heard some friends talking about a new music that caused to i thought if like them they must be my only records until then were mills the brothers & nelson soon after while on vacation with the family at a military cafeteria in i heard a song which i later learned was me do ' and was 
 when the first for this film was viewed by myself i was as to what the would take after all the plot of having one 's return to the present leaves open many options bruce however does a job in the role he was given i was surprised to see just how well he could act in this part this is also a good career move as many others have said but after seeing it i now agree this film 
 in addition to all the negative reviews i was to see that at the drop of a hat somewhere somehow a was summoned at a most unlikely location to show the look what was going on notably near the where the professor is hit at full wind force against the head by a heavy object and subsequently lives to tell the story otherwise i was unable to shake off the image of some actors as portrayed in other i said 
 i am still waiting for that dark film where we wo n't know how it ends from the beginning i think could do one with this time i was not expecting such a thing but deeply she moved to a level acting this one with the were more than she was a then the entire film was bar i loved him he was the only one to ever get me while as god got me and if we ca n't 
 i too must for a somewhat opinion of this as i contributed to the still i received my copy sat back and enjoyed the rolling cast of characters who were perhaps more than the characters they were creating in this tale of a film shanghai for those who feel george bush is a credible one need look no further than this film to the image that texas is full of truck driving the cast contains some of the most and 
 trigger man is definitely the most boring and movie i 've ever seen in my life my 's holiday are more actors seem to be recruited at they do not have any talent to act in a convincing walk and walk and walk through the forest there 's more than in all three parts of the lord of the together after the first hour i began to read a while watching trigger man along the way total waste of time

 perhaps i missed the meeting when the meaning of was explained but what i just saw was ridiculous you want a good of this movie take aliens replace the with then remove everything that was good about it and that 's pretty much minutes into the movie the that 's the i 've ever heard checks out a base been by and then they climb down down what a obviously attached to a with an obvious present day train in

 just to mention one more thing about jim i agree with all the that make this among 's greatest in a career of great i would think this role playing jim is more like his real than the he was as seemed like a party animal from his and was one guy whose real life was more exciting than his screen life the extra thing i wanted to point out is notice the great and still that the film although 
 but because it includes an actor i actually recognize james is by these types of movies ' standards lawrence he 's given some decent performances on stuff like and various star so it 's kind of amusing if mildly watching him himself here there 's a plot 's character and his wife are fighting he 's having an affair with a movie while trying to do his film and their guest decides to enjoy the of but watching is really 
 i had n't seen this film in probably N years so when i recently noticed that it was going to be on television cable again for the first time in a very long time it is not available on video i made sure i did n't miss it and unlike so many other films that seem to lose their when finally viewed again i found the images from the pride of the were as vivid and effective as i first 
 it 's been N months and you know what that means a new movie has really been on role making horrible film after horrible film each time every movie getting worse and worse he 's really amazing i do n't really know what to say about first it 's a piece of the story makes no sense at all he uses men in all his fight scenes and last but not least a lot of the is taken from other 
 i could n't hold back the when i watched this beautiful it was disturbing and all in one i recommend this to anyone seeking something that will make them think about what they are doing with their own lives or simply something that will make you think you watch as john lives through the last couple months of his life you watch as he goes through his days with a positive attitude at one point you begin to see that 
 one piece of that is often forgotten about this family film is one of the time in N this movie held the record for the biggest movie premiere in motion picture history and may continue to hold it was held in pittsburgh pennsylvania no doubt in honor of the original film 's angels who the pittsburgh in this they the california the premiere was held at the long gone three stadium which was the home of the pittsburgh and the 
 chase has created a true phenomenon with the performances writing and some great music make up what has become quite possibly the best show of the cast are strong but and earned every inch of those 's anyone who doubts this need only sample a few episodes particularly from the first few seasons james is absolutely fierce absolutely and you still find yourself him by people that i 've spoken to about the who have n't seen it yet will 
 this movie may be the worst movie i have ever seen basically it is right above N the only difference is that it missing ice t. the scene where he does the with the oh they made a second one 
 not only the title the film itself is a long one too or so it seems that 's because of the style of acting and the way its themes are bad of the and a who not speak the name of his sexual preference italy N you do n't believe it and you do n't have to 
 let 's just say it in simple words so that even the makers of this film might have a chance to understand this is a very film with an even script and a story that 's about as original as do n't bother unless you need to find some way to a group of adults or extremely slow children they might especially if they 're off their there 's a special kind of in a film this ridiculous not only 
 first off let me say that this is probably in my opinion one of the N most movies since this came out in i absolutely loved this movie it 's very urban no real hollywood added to it you can actually feel for all of the characters in here i love the blood just in here joe was pretty good in here but to me it seems like he was definitely by the lead character joe now i do n't 
 throughout the is mostly an action movie and what action there is to and much much more it stars kim and baldwin as the is a and i have not seen the original but really did n't care for this one at all although and baldwin have some nice screen chemistry but the movie itself did n't do it for became really really quickly the plot is by one after another and as the violence keeps up and baldwin retain 
 this movie is bad just bad in terms bad the off the screen and you in the face with its and then on your ability to detect even amounts of is bad in los angeles can be especially bad i live in the city of angels i can to that what is so terrible about the in los angeles is its nature it at you with a knowing or a word until just at the edge of a full on 
 there 's not much to say about this one is some kind of fire breathing he is by a nuclear explosion he heads for land and begins to destroy building and tanks and other junk oh power lines i almost at one time early in the film he a little boy and instead of just throwing him away or him he places him down on the ground safe from then on we have to watch this faced little show up 
 realistic years later the pictures can look a bit old but actually it only accurate the in the face ' effect of the movie i never saw in my whole life a film like this one first time i saw it i did n't know if it was a and it did n't looked like that movie is a that every single person in the world have to see it 's the best ever society critical movie the ultimate movie 
 this almost perfect of 's popular children 's novel follows the lives of and peter and their mother after their father is unfairly accused of and sent to prison they go to live in an almost house in the country which stands near a railway line writes stories to make enough money for food and while the children spend much of their time around the railway station and specifically to one particular train to their love to an involving and 
 i am a huge fan i even enjoy films some people consider as stupid i also like the more the as long as it has a reading the other people 's reviews on the site i was sure this film was going to be a little but much to my disappointment it proved to be one of the most films i 've ever acting was terrible the were stupid the plot was the special effects were and the was probably 
 no matter how many times tries to get road we always know what 's going to happen though our always remains with the highlight in hook line and is a scheme that hopes will finally finish off but of course you know what e. continues engaging in defined by george as your effort after you 've forgotten your aim while road pretty much never becomes aware of the potential danger or lack in which he could find himself a real 
 i saw this movie on a american airlines flight it was so bad it actually made the flight seem longer the plot had potential who would n't love a movie about a woman who every she meets but it got up a million different times by really poor writing the end is an bad scene where a gang of is on the of a casino the sky thinking he 's going to return then a group of stars moves together 
 a of a from the silent era was by network and was broadcast for likely the first time in decades if makes this so are the douglas is attacked by giant will pays a visit as ' of studios as well as appearances by and william s. hart the image of gum the shoes of the a idea for 's boss can not be described it must be viewed a cultural 
 this movie was a horrible excuse for a movie first of all the casting could have been better the main character looked nothing like her tv mom also the plot was it was extremely and predictable the ending was very disappointing and but all i 'll say about that the in the bag though was a scene when jordan was supposed to be but the girl could n't cry on command there were no down her face just a few 
 he did one at christmas to try and bring back a number one song and now the justin lee collins wanted to the cast members and maybe some crew of one of his tv shows as a kid the the only member he would n't be able to get was the late great george who played main character col. john smith but he did get some kind of to try and help he did manage to all members including templeton 
 the deceptive cover title and very small hidden print of power of me into this started out really well and pulled me in i really liked it between and 's of it the film started throwing in things that were not set up and made no sense my first thought was this is not written by someone who knows how to tell a story i ended up parts of the movie thinking i had missed the time i reached the 
 i just finishing watching that i ordered from my library i remembered it from years ago and wanted to watch it with my son anyway the movie was less than N hours running time and i thought it was much longer when i first saw it the back of the box states that the a file whose secrets could destroy the free world forever the were supposedly on a covert mission to retrieve the document there was nothing even spoken 
 this is an excellent film full of themes and great dialogue the characters are well drawn with phil the biggest loser of all 's character is the most vicious thing i 've seen on screen since guinness 's portrayal of in the last ten days ' i just wish they 'd all got away with it but without giving too much away there are some situations you just can not lie your way out of 
 watch the N N minutes is an excellent about movies of science it was produced and directed by the critic richard author of more than N books on this theme mark is the joins directors as steven james george and ridley scott to carry through a trip in time and space to show some of the most science movies of the and also some more recent the shows six different approaches the of the war the trips to the moon 
 now we know movies the excellent paper will be blue and but its worth to see again or at last this first which shows perfectly clear his initial its very interesting to see how his talent developed into confirming him as one of the best contemporary course the movie itself is excellent and professional script direction photography definitely one of the best in the most serious and competent sense also sense is compelling and and he actors well they simply 
 these are one of the movies that do n't require any brain or thinking it 's a very funny time pass which you in the next hour or so i was really surprised with john 's acting he usually playing the like character with the face so from that to playing the complete opposite and does it successfully by managing to the comic such as and i was also quite surprised with the 's N because there roles do n't 
 is another of the blair project i think there 's about two dozen of those things out there it has N very attractive women which includes smith and strain and one guy whose only purpose is to provide comic so i 'm thinking cool great looking women having sex with each other very N minutes or so this should be real good unfortunately the producers it there is nothing in this video that actually as a sex scene there 's 
 this is a known fact mr. can not he can act he can kick there are no real no laughing out loud and no real point of watching this confusing movie we see an over weight mr. as dr. who is in desperate need of a and his real daughter made an appearance as his office assistant story so lives in another with his sweet daughter they sit and enjoy their red tea and and on the other end of 
 the in retreat is a acting is terrible the atmosphere is and the characters are only scary thing about this piece of is that majority of the users gave it a is really no no violence the evil dead is completely wasted the supporting cast is also some people may like this picture especially a mainstream society but fans or wo n't enjoy this piece of i hate i prefer watching serious movies like or last house on the left 
 this is one of those movies where i was for whoever could end the movie the i wanted to see the kill and garcia just to get it over with basically this is the deal two have to die and a third has to get horrible burns on his face for garcia 's son to get a bone transplant from convicted killer is it worth it no 
 a previous said the movie is not all that bad what the movie child oh but was naked in it so let 's give it N out of N stars why not a full N because the was the child 's looks of shock were and the fat friend was nowhere in the review does the express any that an american movie in N featured scenes of a child having sex with a grown woman i happened to catch this 
 what were they thinking when they made this truly terrible film one of the most important and women of the century had a and dramatic life what anyone to make this film which explains her unique artistic vision as being the result of an affair with a yet played by downey in real life broke out of a traditional marriage and woman 's role to express herself in this movie is an whose is all attributed to a beauty and 
 this movie 's script is from others most notably the core another bad movie it 's pretty clear why does n't get much work but to see the michael resigned to something like this is just really ca n't think of one plot twist that is n't seen coming a mile away that 's not an effects are very poor even by tv standards the flow at the beginning of the movie the coming global disaster starts things off at 
 although the actors do a convincing job playing the losers that parade across the screen the fact that these characters are impossible to identify with had me looking at my watch a mere N minutes into the film and more than once after that the plot development is and slow the of the main character 's only friend is practically the base quality of most of the characters actions and the way in which they are treating is is typical 
 the character acting is a little stiff as if it is the first time man of the actors have appeared on screen unfortunately one of the better jean simmons played many bit roles on tv like in star and in the heat of the night dies quickly and thereafter her acting can be lead role is as portrayed by robertson is forced to carry this movie with his body language for most of the time he does n't do a 
 N out of N this is a truly wonderful story about a and a carpenter tom the boy william is with tom and it is immediately apparent that he has serious issues when he his bed on the first night william is and frightened but somehow the two find in each others it that william has a talent as an artist and we see tom 's talent as a in an amusing of william is by a young jewish also 
 believe me i wanted to like spirit the comments people made at the time of its release about how it was to see old-fashioned again as if the last had been released years ago and the even more comments about how computers had now made the old techniques had got my blood up but then the i had to endure in the first ten minutes of spirit got my blood up even character designs are generic the partly as a 
 i had the of watching this movie with my girlfriend who like me is a fan of the first this movie down right it lacked the magic of the first you could actually understand every word the mice said the is the palace is much much different from the first movie there 's new characters that were never mentioned before and were terrible the prince did n't have many lines which kept him from stupid basically its like the lion 
 this is actually one of my favorite films i would recommend that everyone watches it there is some great acting in it and it shows that not all good films are american 
 my college theater just had a special last night of this film i have got to say that i think everyone was impressed with how good this movie was though my did n't care for it but he 's not into movies anyway and just went to see if paris hilton can act by the way if you 're worried about that do n't be i 'm not exactly one of her fans but i must be honest and say 
 i this movie because the cover was cool looking the first N minutes of the movie are and somehow interesting but once the young woman and her little sister go on their trip everything goes to hell and the movie becomes boring 
 i watched a made for television film about the destruction at texas it was obviously heavily toward the claim that david was a child leader on killing as many as he wanted and taking his people to the on a blood film was little more than propaganda further detailing what we had already read in the newspapers i am more and more sure of that since i watched the great the rules of not that every made in this film 
 seriously the fact that this show is so popular just the mind this show is n't funny it is n't it is n't original it 's just a pile of bull let me start with the characters the characters are all with loud voices that just sound like on a the voice acting could 've been better then there 's the my god it my eyes just looking at it everything is too flat too too bright and too candy 
 one would think as i did that with steve martin and john a movie should be at the very least decent these stars especially martin and have produced some of the works of comedy of all apparently i was grossly this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen it my mind how one joke after the other can be so it me to watch these actors execute one of the most scripts i have had the to 
 many more reviews than this have described the quite spectacular acting casting and of this film it appears that the only negative reviews focus on a perceived in the film 's handling of the core moral question film is bar the final scenes in stressing 's belief that he 's not making some grand point but merely that for him a life of dignity is a life not worth living we as viewers see an enormous amount of dignity in 
 i hoped for this show to be somewhat realistic it me as just another mainstream show after i watched it i did n't feel the characters at all is this idea of how terrorism operates the main character does n't act like a at all and how he passes for a terrorist is beyond my neither of the other managed to appear genuine one of the members a white boy would never be accepted by in real life another member 
 i really wanted to like this movie but it was just the acting was the plot was and the pace was slow the whole time sitting in the theater i wanted the movie to end into a films and i 'm for an ending sure some of the were nice but guys i mean really and for a movie about a guy instruments there really was n't much music to speak of the music there was was and boring there 
 if you get a chance to get a hold of this lost for many years i doubt you will be disappointed ps has an odd of social and even hints of but it 's so odd that it was not only ahead of it 's time nothing has been seen like it strongly disagree with people who say that the film is dated especially with lee 's a few years back which was a of trying to capture the same 
 all i could think of while watching this movie was many have spoken about it 's quality is how this film such a realistic representation of the effects of drugs and an individual and their subsequent into a state of unfortunate events yet really the techniques used as many have already mentioned were and thus and irrelevant to the film as a far as the plot is concerned it was and you can read most other reports on this film 
 i am of what was using in the movie and also the of the bullet that he was to be if this is based on carlos 's i am that it is a round i am also of the itself he also made a comment in the final movie about the that the vietnamese man let him use that to his father mentioned that he thought it was the best ever made i would like to know which that is 
 this was really the worst movie i 've ever seen anyone who has seen it will know what i 'm talking about i saw it on so i did n't waste my money please everyone do n't waste your time i 'm really this was n't straight to video 
 this is definitely a see ' for those who occasionally smoke a in their secret trying to avoid being caught by parents teachers the police etc the is a lady in her living in her mansion breeding and absolutely of the fact that her so-called rich and husband is actually broke and cheating on her when he all of the sudden dies she is confronted with the truth the comes by to tell her that she is in a huge 
 the thing about calling house of the dead the worst movie of all time is that it 's really not there are worse movies out there i watch of hong kong movies that are basically the result of an japanese police drama having of inserted at the end to create something that could technically be called a movie house of the dead is however one of the worst films i 've ever seen at the walking out half way through 
 and the was n't exactly shakespeare but then nobody wanted it to be it was but it did have brains it had a very smart script with characters and a fun people came out of the theater smiling provides none of this there is no reason to if it 's supposed to be a to the hollywood it makes them look by providing nothing but fight scenes and one of the most i 've ever seen it all looks phony 
 the film is about sir christopher strong member of parliament played by and his affair with the character played by up until they met he had been a very devoted husband but when he met the odd but he could n't help himself and they fell in love you can tell because they off into space a lot and talk about how painful their love is frankly this is a dated and practically impossible film to watch part of the 
 this was a really interesting halloween film i to with the whole theory but it still makes for a good film i liked getting to see doyle back but donald died right after shooting the film had a really really bad director who give a about the series from what i heard treated donald bad and let harris come back as jamie its like he was just trying to bring down the film but i still liked it there were 
 i do n't see why everyone this film so much true it does have good intentions and meaning but you can not compensate for such a poor script allen is a brilliant but i 'm afraid this is just a piece of garbage it 's extremely predictable and the subject matter is all too visible i happen to be a huge fan and love most of his work but this i can not 
 this is one of 's first national films from the period between his mutual and the more mature united artists features more than the mutual films it continues 's for his comic expression most people forget that the film is actually a dream that charlie has while awaiting being sent off to the is plenty of via the being used to gas the enemy and 's into enemy territory dressed as a this stage in this career the great man 
 this is an extraordinary film it made me feel awful that died in N before i had a chance to see her live to know that she performed a lincoln concert in N & that i might 've been there but was n't is painful beyond just purchased my first recording while the musical recording is being able in this film to see her face & its tremendous & passion as she these of terrible is wonderful sort of like 
 an is always risky business and i think this should be praised there 's a lot of talent involved here a great many actors directors and writers unfortunately i could n't really enjoy this movie based on three issues i of all the segments vary in tone and quality and unfortunately some of them clash with the others several segments feel to me like seeds of good stories that never come to i 'm not talking about happy here or 
 i paid one dollar for this and at first i was feeling off but then i started thinking about it and i should be i have found a a real of bad if you think the opening dramatic shots of an empty stadium successfully with 's camera address then wait until the opening credits roll on the 's the script seems to be together from press and but i just ca n't believe how bad george hamilton is he seems 
 i 'm starting to write this review during a break as i watch the movie it 's the first time i 've tried doing that but i 'm having trouble getting through this one without breaks that 's not because it 's intense but because it 's 's almost painfully and especially when the robust dying brother is on screen being and and this would have been a much better movie if they 'd just left that character out of 
 fever pitch has many of the we have come to identify with hollywood romantic a relationship between two people with little in common the secret he 's been that she the inevitable breakup and the very public well i wo n't go any further but you get the picture in spite of its it works especially if you love baseball as i do though i 'm not quite as as ben a boston played by saturday night live from a 
 this movie has an all star cast john candy richard lewis and jim to name a few run in monte as well as some other beautiful european locations and is very funny the trouble that everyone gets in when they lie to protect themselves is great and i highly recommend that you see this movie it is well worth it john candy is in top form in once upon a crime as is everyone else if you and your family 
 very good arts film and jet is the best since the master himself bruce lee is excellent as the low key who all time and time again he has a presence and a look that is and as the king that you do n't mess with is simply beautiful in that mixed race original way that is unique because of her mixed heritage she has an and an all at the same time that i found the man with the 
 john carpenter 's it the greatest film of all time no maybe not to everyone but to me it is and always will be the film is sheer and will always hold a very special place in my heart it 's unfortunate i did n't get to see this film until years after it 's release but even years later after so many copy had come and gone the film still gave the same impact as it must have done 
 as a film i obviously had read all the reviews and funny comments about this film my being allen 's if i had my life to live over again i would n't change anything except for seeing the musical of lost horizon therefore i 've never been able to watch it without at the etc just recently i came across a and watched it for the first time in years along with a friend who had never heard of the 
 for the record the N version of the blue is not the original film as many have story was in great britain in N just after the novel was written as much as i 'd love to see the N version i 'd enjoy an opportunity at seeing the true original release of this story on the N film with christopher and the two youngsters was with beautiful the acting did n't seem all that great when i first viewed 
 after seeing the from the film i knew i was about to live one of those film which make me want to take my eyes i felt a slight optimism because the movie had a solid cast which i thought it was going to rescue the that did not is a horrible movie but it is not is the best i can say about from written by the same guys from license to something which explains they have anything but 
 this is an incredible piece of drama and powerful which hits you i found the film was great and getting to with the two main characters this was represented in a great performance by both two michael and whether the story is based around a true story i feel the story was trying to giving the audience a message that as a whole the general public should respect and feel for the needs of disabled people and that they should 
 what is love what is this in our hearts for is it not the does not this of love have the of fine fine diamonds does not the wind love the is not love not unlike the unlikely not it is to are you with someone tonight do not question your love take your by the hand release the power within yourself your heard me release the power the wild with a with one intimate that 's right do n't 
 despite some really locations in the and some energetic music by franco this film does n't quite reach the level of joe 's similar efforts while staying just about as the author of the original book the of a woman directed and had a role in this film which mostly a very young as she gets in a variety of sexual situations her played by 's al actually approves of her sleeping around and even her to continue her practices 
 i consider this movie a but it took me at least N N times to see it so as to realize what a great movie it was first it describes a face of that we do n't usually see in hollywood movies in particular german soldiers army and the government are shown more one of the facts that impressed me most was the mention by the end of the movie of a murder that took place in a forest in 
 well this just maybe the worst movie ever at least the worst movie i have ever seen they have tried out these N child of the movies about N times and none of them is good and this just maybe the worst of them they think that it 's going to be better movie as more they use that fake blood this movie does n't have any idea in it actors and is just terrible even make out that N 
 well is quite a good but typical 's movie it shows different aspects of indian families etc the movie is more than good but not extremely big plus point of the movie is direction music and and 's acting especially the last scene the movie starts with a common factor of indian movie a girl being by her story is the movie is a bit common but it is good good enough to make the movie a point is common 
 i guess there are two ways to make a movie with kids as the intended audience you can either say to yourself a let 's make a movie that kids today will love or b let 's make a movie that i would have loved when i was a kid the second approach explains why steven often make movies that appeal to a younger audience prime examples are the or indiana jones that cat is an example of the first 
 due to the fact that in N there were no i felt that the movie was quite the studio productions were very good and very elaborate the background effects were very and always appeared as if they were part of the whole set the actors did ok considering the of the film being set in a type of atmosphere where and possibilities of future exploration were at most had i watched this film in N i probably would have been 
 was struck at how even the acting was throughout william had an acting range that is wonderful for silent film not over the edge there are moments where the camera work is most excellent and combined with the story like when he is waiting to see the very well done enjoyed the 
 the plot does n't offer any new it even starts the same as i. this time there are no other for the machinery except for having an extra exit which is not very the characters are also not so well as in the first episode they just became flat as in a soap opera if somebody makes it to the normal exit the person would be asked some questions like do you believe in god its not really creative or 
 ordinarily i really enjoy movies like chances are but i was n't quite satisfied with this one for a few reasons the first half was pretty well done overall with alex dying and being in a new body played by robert downey jr. he meets up with his wife and friend and his daughter who is now grown up the scenes with them meeting again and downey who he once was are well done and there is a good amount 
 though and are the points of this story and are good counterparts for this is where and will be in N still in love the whole cast does a nice job from to john it shows a real of life though i saw this long i am glad it finally to the place where he was recognized in hollywood for his talent from the music to the scenes at the opera to the kitchen table this is a very entertaining 
 any one who saw the original would have to go out and destroy this alex baldwin trying to the late steve in a word for word just does n't work while baldwin has done some work this is a from start to finish had never try to compete with a star as for kim in the role of enough said looked dangerous and as the film had excitement and baldwin and company made this into a comedy i the one 
 to say that is a forced looking nasty to listen to and painful to watch film would n't be saying enough there are only two reasons i can think of why you 'd watch this film N you 've seen when you were young like i did and are as to what it is like but you will really only be watching to find out how badly they things up or N you 're seeing it with someone under ten 
 phillips stars in the action series william tell set in the century during the hostile of switzerland william tell is a reluctant freedom fighter against the and of the forces william tell is the swiss version of robin phillips plays the it is possible that would have had greater success in the role but he was unavailable at the time of the classic action show is made up of series of the episodes are in black and white but this 
 reading through all these positive reviews i find myself how is it that so many enjoyed what i consider to be a bad of my second novel there are many problems with the film already mentioned in a few reviews simply put it is a mess from opening credits to many characters are and neither nor puts in a performance that is worthy of them the worst by far is i have very much enjoyed her performance in some roles 
 is a very interesting movie that is somewhat difficult to psychological is the most appropriate i can think of the female alice that she does n't remember anything of the last three days the only clue she has is a torn photo of a hotel she is also by a very vivid dream about a science movie that she believes she saw many years ago in her pursuit of the truth behind her she does n't trust anyone but little 
 this movie was really bad it has that quality that a lot of movies have moments of humor filled with long that are completely boring any fan will like this movie but then again probably the only person who would see it someone gave me this movie to watch knowing i am a fan of and was a fan of la before the nature of that show wore thin to explain why this movie does n't work i should just 
 i 'm afraid that i did n't like this movie very much apart from a few saving it 's nothing to write home about has for the last years but the films themselves have on more than one account been and carbon copies of a previous success this is one of this is a movie the beginning is promising with scenes from a where a dead girl has her eyes together but soon after opens them however after that it 
 i bought a of this film for my girlfriend who shares the same name as the ghost girl in this film and enjoys movies about the the movie was shot entirely on video so it has the look of a pbs special about it the special effects are looking but there are actually some scary moments in the movie that got us to jump in our seat there is a particularly effective scare involving a virgin mary the acting is 
 i saw most of my today at the film festival in new york and had to leave the theater due to feelings of up within me i 've seen movies and i 've seen of movies this movie could n't decide which one it wanted to be so it ended up being a joke on seems to have been from movies like and and calling and what a sloppy job at that how can ever be off of its determination 
 i too was enough to see checking out with peter at the phoenix film festival this is an extremely sweet character driven film that leaves the audience in the 's plight in life more than funny each character in the family comic relief that not only but a few as well peter was born to play this role he plays a young father of three who brings his adult children together in what could possibly be one of the most 
 what a terrible movie this was i made it about N minutes into it and started until the end the plot is nothing special and the from the movie from the main story so much that your head will out of rage many minutes wasted just listening to characters on about something irrelevant to the plot something that could said in a shorter amount of time the camera work is shaky and it seemed mr. needed to take his finger 
 maybe this them in the N 's but this is one of those that does n't age well it 's got that working man of a rate rod live tv broadcast the plot is by the book the character 's troubled background seems and the love interest is and gives an ok performance but man he sure was an if i had to work with this guy in a warehouse i 'd probably want to hit him with a hook 
 i was quite impressed with this movie as a child of eight or nine the seemed very real and threatening to me and i could see why people would have been afraid of someone like seeing it as an adult it seemed almost to the and details like driving cars that looked like they were from the there is a certain reality to the way the criminals are portrayed but the overall effect is more like a bad soap opera 
 best fan boy movie i 've ever watched save free enterprise in some ways it reminded me of an early kevin smith you do any kind of role playing this movie will likely have you laughing often at its fun do n't expect a big budget here the acting is also questionable at times but it really adds to the fun of the atmosphere they create the script is truly with a lot of moments worth that always gets killed 
 first than anything i 'm not going to 's short film even i 'm mexican and proud of his success in mainstream another hand i see most of the reviews focuses on their favorite and not so short films but we are that there is a bottom line that circles the whole and maybe it will not be so for american people even if that was not the main purpose of the producers what i 'm talking about is that 
 imagine if you will four students have an to spend the night in a house in st. louisiana to check for the existence of the if you watch this in the dark and late at night you possibly will have the hair on the back of your neck rise a couple of times otherwise this is a very off of blair project what is to be dialogue is very and the actors are looking enough but seem to lack genuine 
 in a four a cell who used his company to commit a fraud and was by his wife the drag and his the who his six months sister and the intellectual marcus who killed his wife one night finds an ancient journal hidden in a hole in the wall of the cell they realize that the book was written by in the beginning of the last century and is about black magic they decide to read and use its content 
 oh if only i could give this less than one star there were two mildly amusing parts in the whole film and that is it one was where a line or two from the song do n't worry be happy was sung by the and the other was where fell of the toilet roll and landed with his feet and apart so that everything else he landed on on the way down hit him in the that is it there 
 this film is what happens when people see like in this particular one blair project and say hell people running around with cameras acting slash no i can do it and start out with a idea make up a terrible script and get a bunch of actors and start shooting a film plot is that in africa there a a breed of man like animals who hunt and kill humans the think that it 's a or a evil spirit 
 i just finished up this of 's the fear that was shot in louisiana outside of a few changes names setting this follows the short story point by point for the first N minutes but then tries to its own twist ending that you could see coming from a mile away either way it is a much better than full moon 's the fear too bad it is a terrible film director david mccormick the thing with all the of 
 despite its budget limitations this is a great film proof that effort and can overcome lack of cash the opening in which seem to show how some at least survived into the age of human beings is a nice red after that a comes down into a lake and causes heat which in turn causes the of a frozen egg maybe the suggest instead that this is n't the first time such a thing has happened when the appears it 
 this N is directed by leon and a at the publicity photos and packaging might lead you to believe that this lies somewhere between and is a strictly affair with no and little edge at all of whom i am a fan his stuff as de de la he is more than anything else one gets the feeling with this film that we have seen him and it done all before strictly therefore for only 
 charles stars as a police who declares war on a named duke fernandez who the daughter of a japanese businessman who is the man who 's daughter in this yet may not be for everyone with it 's somewhat disturbing plot but it is well made and indeed entertaining 
 in his otherwise excellent book lincoln in american memory the merrill peterson calls young a boring film this analysis simply proves that great are rarely fine film critics i am working on a on lincoln and frederick as part of my preparation for writing the i made a careful analysis of this film and of tag brilliant interpretation of it in his book on ford young mr. lincoln comes out that year of the first phase of ford 's that 
 this is an excellent fast by craven nightmare on street who for N minutes leaves aside the and presents us with something even more the evil of human beings we are far more likely to the benign evil of jackson than and murphy batman begins does an excellent job of a friendly even killer the performances by murphy and by from the are brilliant most of the film takes place on a very intimate level between two people their eyes 
 watched this when it was first and then missed it when it disappeared of british screens it showed a different side of old australia that we need to see more of good of old hand and young then the of the hard out back was it was missed this show was a cold look at the old way of looking at australia hard living and hard working the young with the old practical head real fighting with the young of 
 this movie came and went in the theaters due to the nature of it you can see why it was n't well received it was unfairly because of its subject matter more than the actual film itself higher learning is not spectacular but it was good film that tried to talk about a feared subject in america higher learning is mostly centered around played by a track star who is has to deal with not being fast enough and a 
 my family and i the night before and as bad as is my four year old loved it hot rod makes it look like worthy material the only thing that could have saved this movie was if himself had come out of retirement to in the face for making this movie i will admit however that the was good i was n't sure if the movie was set in the N 's but with the majority of the music coming 
 here in germany it was only shown on tv one time today as everything becomes mainstream it 's impossible to watch a film like this again on the screen maybe it 's the same in usa or especially the message is a truth find friends to make your ideas come a bit closer to reality or you become a loser if not an whole film is not particularly as simple as it may seem here every little scene every sentence 
 ok the very idea is kids do n't own planes kids do n't race planes with it made the air force look like total the kids father would not jeopardize his entire career to allow his boy to with him neither would a reserve i am sure were worse than this the is about the only quality of this waste of i am sorry but i just do n't understand why in the world anyone would write direct and produce 
 some funny but come bill a film keep the tv show and the interviews but a film i 'm probably but what a unnecessary film i do n't know i disagreed agreed this film is very confusing and 's a funny guy but also very bill 's rhetoric is similar to bill a brilliant but like many the between comedy and can be i think that the major problem in this film is his lack of this might be just 
 the opening was a steal from a film that is everything this one is n't and are the words that apply along with others that ca n't be repeated type returns to his home town meets up with old friends etc the usual kid single mother local and so on bad special effects ship atmospheric did n't the director see close good acting good story good camera good cutting not here do not rent unless you are sharing the cost 
 i felt this film throughout i impressed with russell 's talent in developing his relationship with such a typical of approach a bit and very persistent really loved the and direction pace was just right and the of nearly all characters was did n't russell 's talent even in N and i have yet to see 
 the film maybe goes a little far but if you love the show it 's what you expect it 's not a bad movie it 's actually pretty good if you do n't like the show do n't see the movie it starts off a little slow maybe but then picks up and turns out to be pretty funny there are even a few scenes toward the end after all the have gone through these do get to you also 
 i thought this movie was really really great did an amazing job in it i thought she played her character very well she 's an actress the movie was also really funny too the jokes were great i stop laughing i think everyone should see it 
 this film is a disaster from beginning to end N percent of the movie is made from scenes taken from & the world and & the women badly together with original scenes that do not add up to anything but a complete i 'm a big fan of those two movies and seeing scenes taken from them and with dialogue made my head spin these kind of cheap producers tactics to make more money by audiences basically killed the & 
 much as we all love al it was painful to see him in this movie a publicity at the ending of what seems to have once been a distinguished and career plays his part looking like an bed and everyone with a totally and southern plot out this way and that with so many loose ends and that the mind and then is there not doing much her scenes with are flat and hard to believe they meant a lot 
 you the for showing this soft core sex at N a.m. i truly enjoyed it to be honest i expected a lot more from a cast with and of course the as carter production values are truly bad mainly because of the low budget but a little more effort would n't harm for example the makes it look like a hard core movie there 's absolutely no effort in but let 's ignore that fact because let 's be honest 
 i had actually considered investing in this movie when was out up funding i loved most of the script but did not like the ending insisted the ending was as it had to the completed movie i have to say i am reading the script i had not the acting and 's would be as powerful and moving as it is here the two leads did an amazing job they were very and this movie is well worth watching just 
 what was bruce thinking when he signed on for this one this one made no sense to me i was so confused by it it funny at all i even know why disney made this one bruce is a great actor whom liked for a long time and this disappointed me a lot pass this one by on the video shelf 
 this movie had the potential to be a decent but it was hampered by only having about minutes worth of good script which was mostly used up in the beginning after that started to appear in the story that one could drive a truck through the movie followed a curve from good to ordinary to bad to by the time it concluded it 's not recommended 
 this is a video version of a stage production with extra shooting for the video edition the result gains both the drama of the stage with the impact of well produced film the set by george with and by are norman is and one gets to hear and see the young this production is stunning emotional and if you do n't see this you have missed out 
 i watched all three mad max films in succession for the first time a few days ago and was left bitterly disappointed with the third it the fine work of the first two films with weak and action and a story line that turns the australian into a sand pit one would expect to see in a children 's movie the character of max is from his dark and seen in the previous films and changed into a predictable that 
 i once used ' name as a clue to go ahead and watch a new film in which he appears so now for the first time my of film recommendation has failed utterly i should first have come here to see these ought to be to allow his otherwise efforts to be so wasted in the contractor of my worst fears has come to bitter i feared that the shaky and style first brought to my attention by the paul 
 this has to be the worst movie ever the acting is than the movie lots of blood but no idea where it comes from they do n't even show you the cuts i ca n't believe i wasted my time watching this movie we like we were watching a comedy and not a movie this is a to films for one if they are in asia why is there a white driving past waste management trash cans there 's so 
 in the N 's and in some cases flat out was pretty high do we get to win this time a line famous from first blood part ii could almost sum up how many people felt at that time a for the style of films they grew up with flat out balls to the wall we 're good your bad now let 's blow something up and go home while rocky and for the most part top gun seemed more 
 i enjoyed this movie extremely it was the last great mario van movie i know of it had a old west flavor to it big kane and tone had major parts it should n't have won any but it was all the same 
 first of all i do n't understand why some people find this movie so sure there are moments when the u.s. are accused directly like at the segments of ken and to a certain extent but come on they are n't accusations instead they are based on real and facts and all the documents that the cia released about chile confirms this for returning to the film itself what i enjoyed most on it is the variety of we find 
 the eighth and thus short of the ones this is the only one quite like this this takes two of the main types of entertainment of the and combines them well this is to the in that aspect the tone the is a the style which is in this is the plot is and the as well as the music is the sound in general is and really helps the mood and atmosphere along with the drawings and designs the 
 as good an for as you 're ever likely to see is an everyday story of royal folk in late century during one of europe 's seemingly internal it concerns itself with the joseph james mason his son the crown prince the miss and various secret wives soldiers horses and the bizarre of european royalty at the time of joseph 's empire in what the old movie used to call a of color it resembles nothing more than an but 
 without doubt beat street is the best film about the scene everything about it is spot on the clothes the music and most the the is basic but there to tell a story about the whole point of the film is to show what kids of that moment in time were doing what to them it shows that in general are good all that to these everyday kids was music and friendship having watched the recently i was surprised how 
 after reading so many reports of serve them all my days ' i went out and bought it for christmas a waste of money i 'm afraid i was looking forward to something in the same league as ' and some of the few other great productions from british television but this is not among them the characters are all too good to be true in a very predictable plot and with the most and script i 've heard in 
 if you want to see a movie with sex drugs alcohol beating of a woman and child rape this movie will satisfy you if you want to see a man exact on the of a wife who left him this movie has it you 've already heard the wonderful music that keeps the raw going the surprise is that in a story of violence action and music a can come in a moment of without a speech which the movie 
 this movie truly shows the and of indian society what it tries to show you is only one side of the story the other side of the story is the hidden emotional and mental abuse of indian children which this movie does not show indian parents are for the following a. destroying the of the children by making them completely dependent on the parents at a very early age such children grow up to be adults only in physical looks 
 even though i have great interest in movies i was to death every minute of the movie everything is bad the movie is too long the acting is most of the time a joke and the script is horrible i did not get the point in the story about and together so if you value your time and stay away from this 
 shuttle is an about four young adults who get a ride late one night on a shuttle bus from the airport to find out that the driver is a some of the of and it 's interesting plot work some aspects just do n't the bad dialogue and characters gives a good reason to not care for them but often the works and asks you the question of what would you do and usually what you would do is n't 
 why did i go to see this film because jim was in it and in the past he has made movies that have made me cry with so do you really blame me for expecting that again additionally the the funny his 's involvement and the fact it was a massive hit encouraged as my one line summary suggests i was disappointed for various reasons reason N it was n't funny in a movie i for about all together the 
 i enjoyed this film but i was surprised to see people referring to it as a comedy it was amusing at times but really it was n't very funny at all if i 'd been expecting it to be a comedy i might have been disappointed with the film but going in with no expectations i found it to be and engaging maybe it was because as an engineer i identified with the i was less concerned with of capital 
 is no ordinary action it 's much to bad to be ordinary one man walks toward another with a machine gun the other man fires one round and the man with the greater fire power without so much as a from the of lead down on him guess which one is the good guy such is through and through not a good action not a good drama not a good movie fails on all levels with it 's cast of 
 if you want to learn something about the spanish civil war and about all the political details and let me tell you you 've chosen the wrong is a vision of the war as it happened in a small island off the coast of spain when a war like this happens in a small island that takes position for the almost at once there is no war in the open the soldiers are sent to the front to fight in 
 and the man ' is one of shaw 's plays if handled and this production does a good enough job is the daughter of a military family who has a of a patrick and who shelters a from the enemy during a on the of and energy this production along at a good pace and if and as the are a bit by the rest of the cast they still hold their ground and as the parents are and the 
 step aside for hollywood veterans the brothers were ' what demanded and what it got however like so many of its recent decisions this one was a director is so out of touch with audience attempting to bring back physical and in place of funny dialogue is just a disaster i knew it the audience knew it and the cast knew a shame why did they ever consider changing directors not only that but the two brothers played as two 
 this movie does not really promote kids to be and have better attitudes as a family movie should and this would n't be considered family anyway because it has some things in it that children should n't be seeing not the best abc family film if you ask me if there were less sexual themes in the movie then maybe it would be better hollywood is n't doing anything to make a movie better by adding in sexual situations there 
 this is for different reasons a very very bad action movie first of all is out of shape he looks old and fat plays like he has to fulfill an obligation and his fight scenes require creative or plain replacement his opponent is a very weak this is about a smart and mean and does not deliver so what about the action well the two parties permanently shoot at each other in different locations of the jail they shoot wild 
 very good point there only an elite few the upper classes would both have access to the and be able to on an exclusively english speaking site such as the some might think is not reality but this point of view really put media society and democracy at stake you are probably right even if there is 's in venezuela most supporters will not afford to even rent a computer for half an hour to comment on you upper class 
 this one is a little better than the first one it still relies on a lot of its humor which basically keeps saying that the old bond movies were not realistic that wears thin after so many the were more interesting in this is a tremendous amount of total gross out humor hopefully one day real comedy will come back 
 i not only consider this to be the best film that jon midnight coming home has ever done but a real to incredible odds pat managed to reach a group of students and bring them from nowhere to a basic and awareness of the world his methods made be criticized by bureaucratic like mr. but teachers like will always be really showed that he had a love for teaching and that it was a natural high for him he did 
 when these events that took place some years ago hard to believe this actually happened i thought well there is a basis for an interesting story here many secrets were never uncovered the horse never found the main never captured this film seems to be by character study and very little attention to the plot some other questions are raised though like why on earth would be in this film its good to see career has taken off again but 
 carl cuba jr. was born to in the deep south he joins the navy he tells his father he will be back the father gives him an old radio and leaves on the navy bus the most valuable thing his father taught him was never quit after a recommendation from a white powers who his drive and he gets sent to navy school at he from his in uniform and from his chief navy master sunday robert de and from 
 film is a that requires a certain level of and this movie has none of that though they really tried hard with the 's the kind of movie that your the dump truck driver who 's always talking about how he 's going to make it big in the movies someday would dialogue is wooden and the while obviously expensive to make are the work of a director who has tried to be and failed due to a severe lack 
 should we take the opening shot as a strange frame i guess we have to anyway two women are behind a closing they walk to the talent agency and we go with them and then they are never to be seen again how come not inside the place at the piano or even outside with the sound of the piano then track inside and over a la so i guess is already telling us in a not very manner that 
 parker and stone the of the show park ' return with something entirely create a new sport that combines baseball and sport is known as 's like basketball except that the rules of baseball are involved and there 's another letter e in the 's how you play you just shoot the ball while these two guys try to you from making the fact i might try it one the game hits the streets it soon becomes a huge would 
 i like lambert as an actor he has played in several good movies subway but i ca n't even think he has played in that movie the story is nearly nothing the special effects are very bad and the actors also to resume the movie i have only one thing to say it 's the first time that i go to watch a movie and want to leave after N minutes 
 perhaps the weakest film in the series despite the presence of john as an egyptian high and george as his predecessor by a bad case of 's disease supporting jr. as the if indeed it was him under the as his contribution is negligible at best it 's a N minutes in itself i guess but the standards have considerably lowered when compared even to the two previous and the end result is strictly routine and not at all just 
 there have been so many many films based on the same theme single girl needs boy to pays him and then guess what she falls in love with him there 's a bit of followed by a row before everyone makes up before the happy ending this has been done many thing is i knew this before starting to watch but despite this i was still looking forward to it in the right hands with a good cast and a 
 we saw this film in toronto at the film festival last year it was a truly moving experience i had heard of the truth and process but as others have written did not know much about the details of the process this film demonstrated the process and the growth that can occur when people are able to face up to their understand the events from the points of view of others involved and together and the others involved in developing 
 i was with this movie as it had such a great the friendship of three women by one falling in love with a younger i to add these women are all drawn in extreme not very supportive of one another and conspiring and to bring each other chancellor and could do no wrong in my book prior to seeing this but here they are handed a dismal script and told to balance the action between and which does n't work 
 he plays straight but with a quiet intensity that makes him one of the top in movie history roy stars in a poor man 's french connection that has a little of the same appeal is a better movie but i prefer watching this one because N i think is great and this is his best movie and N this has the best car chase ever one that makes look like a cable production thanks again to bill who actually 
 although time has revealed how some of the effects were done this story of love and still is you 've never seen this film before you 'll be shocked at how much has been stolen by later film makers i was watching this with a friend who was at how much disney 's from the film they loved the movie and enjoyed that it was such a for so many other films and film 've given the film an N 
 imagine the worst from saturday night live and mad tv in one N minute movie now imagine that all the humor in those bad is removed and replaced with now imagine something N times that ok now go see the underground comedy movie that vision you just had will seem like the thing ever is the single worst movie i 've ever seen there were a few cheap very few but it was even if the intent of the movie 
 film at its best set in the immediate aftermath of N the good bad and of that time montgomery sam because sam 's a and therefore automatically perceived through 's narrow lens to have been a who got out of fighting the war does n't like people like that the truth is that sam was a too but the truth is something which disappears when you 're feeling right about the of hate you 've been in and the world 
 this was one of those films i would always come across be it on tv or cheap but never struck me to give it a shot as i thought i was n't missing out on much it was on one night and i thought oh well why not a good decision too as i would kick myself for taking so long to get around to it for me it left me impressed as it 's up there with burt 's 
 parker and stone transplant their from their to a feature length live action film with generally good results much of the film is and running with their new toy box the plot is itself two average guys a new sport a of basketball with baseball scoring which becomes a national craze along the way they numerous sporting movie and send them up along with any other bit of popular culture that comes into their sights it runs like a stretched 
 was by far the biggest load of i have ever wasted my time watching this show based on the commercials is less entertaining then an actual N sec ad for the makeup was half to say the least hard to imagine a with white teeth even after going to the this show could of had potential for a funny series if they could of gotten the cast from the commercials that in it makes for a show perhaps if the 
 i totally disagree with the person who first about this movie to me this is about a man with growth trying his best to look for the love he is for trying his very best to fit into the society who does n't seemed to accept then met someone who him with best friend 's love and was shown the way to receiving the love he always wanted to have the man who created all that in returned received something 
 as far as films go there are few that are worth time and energy but with a recent of such as date movie and the it is a breath of fresh air to come back and a truly funny like his mother has no end of medical problems little goes to work for the what is a series of most of which work there are however the but a foreign who ca n't master the american language at least a 
 i have been a huge fan of the original crew of the enterprise since i was eight years old i watched all the movies and each one for what they retained from the old series and for further developing the characters and the star universe in general even in the country i thought the aging of the characters was well handled and the story worthy of a theatrical release however having said that star the final is easily the worst 
 i enjoyed this film very much many korean people will feel familiar with this film because many of them have when they go to school was average the movie would have been better if the or the movement of the camera was more however was very neat and acting was also very good kim usually played an innocent weak girl in the korean but this time she plays a very well sang woo also plays his role very i like 
 some war movies succeed where others do not and that can be from a variety of the one where you can feel the raw the of being under attack the soldiers the trials people face inside them when in combat etc are always movies i find compelling movies like and a midnight clear are but two examples of movies that you sense a connection to the characters in the film succeeds on that level as well it speaks of the 
 this show is my guilty pleasure all the way when i first in to america 's next top model i expected to be and to find it very very stupid i did n't this show is actually serious fun i read on one of the other reviews that it makes you wonder if you have what it takes to be america 's next top model and it so does who does n't love the and excitement that come with being 
 awful simply awful it proves my theory about star power this is supposed to be great tv because the guy who directed is the same guy who directed this about a b r i something a thousand times more interesting to do like watch your tv with no picture and no sound i rated it so high there are n't any negative scores in the rating system my theory about star power is the more star power used in a 
 this film is an excellent teaching tool as a of to kill a in with a study of the novel itself can be used as an independent literary study or as an introduction to 
 this film was made and cast from my home town i remember the about it and the whole about the fact was in town essentially N years after a film was laid to rest without being finished a group of film students set out to complete it with dire consequences it would seem someone does not want the film is one has to remember that this is a comedy and therefore has to be taken a little in but it 
 i read some reviews here on and thought i would give this movie a look disappointed on the plus side the male leads are good and some interesting photography but as a whole this movie fails to convince seems to be full of its ' own importance in trying to say something meaningful but falls way short and all in all the picture is an is one of those films classified as a film which can be defined as follows 
 well in all honesty it 's beyond the of stupid but killer is still one entertaining little no plot tons of up effects and a eating monster what 's not to love pretty much a couple of find this that likes to nestle itself within a woman 's beef until a is unfortunately thrust into its mouth it finds it 's host who is later discovered frozen in a house by a group of guys and their equally whose van 
 this show is without a doubt one of the greatest shows ever to be on television i mean the acting is great the the drama the comedy it has everything and with such a simple story a plane on an island the characters are great and lilly is hot fox once again shows us what a great actor he is is so great garcia is i could go on and on also the unexpected plot the back stories of the 
 i was fully up to see this film i had been waiting a year for it to be cleared down here in new zealand i should n't have built myself up so much because it was so disappointing and is without a doubt clark 's worst film there is so much wrong with this film first off some of the acting is great in particular as ' and the girl with the brown hair i ca n't recall her name 
 oh boy where do i go with this one acting weak plot stupid deaths this is n't entertainment this is n't waste your money time or life on this pit of 's just god damn is this movie awful tom why why would you waste your life on this this movie not worth it i 'd rather crack and my head up against a wall than watch this this act again please take my advice and stay the f # 
 returning from N years in china a young refuses to become the for a gang of movie was a bit of a departure from harold lloyd 's previous movies comedy derived more from dialogue often rather serious here rather than the elaborate sight which harold 's of the past there are some moments however which are pure fun as when harold attempts to follow a convertible down a crowded street or when he desperately tries to keep a from losing 
 so N is kind of bad and it does n't really even have the in it and the acting is bad the is stupid but i forget to mention how funny this film is it is so and so ridiculous it is too fun not to enjoy there are only N in the movie and they do n't really seem to be in with the in the other film but they are pretty funny and funny thing that returns for 
 is the first film which stephen king has written a script for given this and the excellent & song that they used as the theme of the movie you would be expecting a odd and ultimately experience unfortunately that 's not what you 'd be getting the thing is they could have probably made it a good movie the beginning is intriguing what with it 's small town atmosphere but something strange happens about N minutes into the film the

 just a comment on new orleans an earlier noted the following this film could have been shot in new york or another northern big city because it presents us with characters that speak more like than maybe a southern one might hear in that part of the country there was also another comment along these lines from an english people in new orleans do in fact sound i have never found out why it 's mentioned in a of by

 well what 's to say the golden child falls in the category so bad it 's good eddie murphy is having some funny and sometimes quite lines but you are still dance has never been worse than his role as the what a f ed up name is this should watch the golden child difficult to say but my best guess would be people who likes embarrassing movies and can be by bad acting bad plot and an even more

 while i was watching this movie i never thought i 'd be defending it it 's honest enough from the about not having much of a plot there 's no real characters to onto except the killer some of the acting can be better but most of it is know a three out of ten is n't but there are reviews saying it was shot poorly and completely etc i think it set out to do what it 's supposed 
 directed comedy that supposedly the classic films but really is no better than them except of course in the technical department good makeup effects and any that is worse than its target is doomed to fail casino our man are worse than almost any james bond movie after two hours of hearing the voices of the aliens you 'll be for some peace and quiet 
 five characters in search of an exit clearly has to be one of the more and better zone episodes ever made because of it 's ideas and plan where the characters have to search to discover identity and it ends as a surprise you have a military major a female bag pipe player a and who all together in the bottom of a wall and none know how they got there and they do n't know who they are so 
 jim not really a film it is a vehicle for as jim but having said that the scenes are a real to the modern there are no N round points decisions plays the irish bank clerk who gets a shot at the world title is well to the role of but his opponent john sullivan is still better however a of the old school played by ward theme of the film is a man pushing for his big chance leaves 
 anyone who has seen the for this film would be for thinking this film is an out and out comedy in actual fact it 's a though not overly funny about a couple of are numerous in the film the script and plot are weak and the love aspect of the story is yet despite all this it is quite thanks largely to the two leads robert and lee miller these two fine actors in particular are always good to 
 an eye opening about the N of a compound near texas people including leader david in a that destroyed the compound there is still debate over how the fire started or can you still trust government ethics 
 i was very surprised how much i enjoyed this film i thought it was funny painful and warm 's performance was and vulnerable for once the director of a film did not make her beauty another character in the film the between kate and her young man is lovely to watch and it plays out very well her relationship with her friends is both a and a in her life who has been a in so many british films does 
 there was some from my part about what this movie had to offer for the casting did n't seem right had already done very well in N and the did n't seem to offer anything challenging to him or the audience appeared out of place and the rest did n't seem very the film finally ended i was not completely for i had seen a decent that could have been much better had the responsible parties taken a little more 
 i was really disappointed i was n't really planning on seeing this movie in the theater and i wish i stuck to that plan it really should be a movie i was kind of excited to see it as i 'm a big fan of but this movie did n't do her justice i 'm a little disappointed with the acting all around what a horrible cover up of 's it bothered me every time i saw her shoulder there 
 you could get into the of this film and say how it could n't happen or how could the main character just walk into offices and start using computers etc without someone and really pick the movie to or you could just sit back with a of and enjoy the story and the acting personally i prefer the latter i live real life and watch the news with all it 's and and so would much rather be by my 
 bad bad bad bad bad what else can i say kate jackson must have been desperate to direct may be she should go back to acting on second thought she was a bad actress to who would put money in to producing something this bad i like movies and usually have a good and the odd scare but this one is just bad bad bad the acting by the stars was worse than what you find on a soap opera 
 there 's nothing amazing about amazing williams ' part of this movie 's problem is its lead actor douglas he was a actor and with it for most of his career he allowed his good looks a manner and usually but not in this movie some fine to make up for his lack of acting ability i douglas as an actor before i knew anything about him as a person i 've enough about him to know that i also 
 warner brothers produced this that was the biggest commercial success for in guy madison leads a band of soldiers and to rescue two white women being held by indians which essentially all there is to this film the format was in its early stages as a hollywood to compete with the growing popularity of home television and the effects work very well here the make off with the and are pursued by the indians until the white men make their 
 one night i upon this on the satellite station out of i decided to watch be perfectly honest i was n't main character is beautiful and her body is shown off would think her would be wasted as a but apparently not after watching the whole film my only real is the acting of the supporting cast particularly the actor who plays its bad the prison guard is he ever does is get drunk and make ill attempted passes at 
 it aired on tv yesterday so i decided to check it out this was one of the last bruce projects related to their old N batman the series after that jeff came along and batman with his new the batman series but anyway the story of this new batman movie centers around the appearance of a new known as however batman feels the need to stop her because of her extreme methods and also in the meantime take down the 
 on paper this movie would sound boring the idea of a man traveling the on a riding certainly does n't have much appeal to it but the real power behind the film is its and its intelligence writers will not find a better study of what makes a movie work than the straight story the perfect example of this is a scene in which alvin meets a runaway girl she 's pregnant and afraid of what her parents would do 
 the worst film ever made bar none give yourself a pat on the back if you can possibly sit through every painful minute of it except for the bit where the loser turned from forced medical his soup on the doctor 's head and like any good should that 's all 
 one of the most romantic and most musical movies ever definitely worth especially if you have a taste for older style of the animals and the alone will make you while watching the movie a must for fans 
 this show is just another bad comedy which will probably be after two seasons it 's not just that the jokes are they 're also not funny and in the first episode the father said something along the lines of ' i wish women did n't go out and get jobs and have the same rights as men ' that really helps attitudes then he was making fun of his son saying he was weird what parent says their kid 
 no i 'm not if they ever propose a movie idea they should be kicked out of the studio i 'm serious their movies are exactly the same in every one and they only consist of traveling to foreign locations having a problem which they easily resolve hoping to be popular and getting new think about it if you have ever seen a movie them with a different plot contact me and tell me its name these movies are poor 
 according to in his de la robert N page N 's character was not very compatible with women he had quite a number of with female members of the to whom he dedicated some but musicians even did not qualify for of fine was a of von died from drink or poison and was according to a frequent customer of street in vienna a british says that contracted before he was that he became because of that is possible but 
 well how do you even rate a movie such as this one does it even have value really it 's a movie that tries to get as close to being a movie as possible basically the entire movie is a bunch of guys a young girl not very appealing and on top of that also not that realistic 's obvious that the movie tried to be as realistic and as possible however the movie is just all too fake for 
 as was to be expected a film made in the would be sympathetic the and have a lot of in it and naturally it is the scene on the mexican border when a custom 's officer by showing little respect and then the latter of making him open his only because he has long hair the constant could have gotten on my nerves had i not been prepared for it to his family and friends about potential movie ideas for 
 this movie has one of the best club scenes very good if you like music some situations as the main character carl begins to take drugs for example are a little off reality but the plot is entertaining but the characters are all a little i 'd not recommend you to see this film if you do n't like the alone this movie is a with the really cool special effects and the club scenes and it 's a but 
 one of the movies made in recent years good plot and chemistry make this one a classic 
 i think it is a nice movie i think it is a very movie through and i think it was not intended to be is a result not a purpose i think it is very natural i think it is i think it was interesting i think the actors never made me think acting they are not & co neither is the film a block they are like the movie normal that can act i think the movie reached its 
 this was surprisingly for a tv movie and quite true to my own experience of it was actually and i can only assume it was written by someone who 's gone through a similar experience because it had all the little details the characters were quite and the performances by and were great i think what i like most was that they made them specific and smart and there was no down of the reasons for beth 's it was 
 really the tale of two brothers and their respective falls from grace via drug and later redemption one brother a played by james franco is your typical sensitive but the other brother is a future doctor who becomes less as he himself falls to while dealing with the stress of living up to his family 's expectations for both children not too heavy handed as drug are want to be and all in all a pretty realistic of the family 
 director who brought us big budget like the and the of has directed this of the die hard concept done on what looks like a blair budget a california nuclear is by arab but are you ready the are n't arab they 're really american soldiers as arabs we find out that they do n't really intend to blow up the just make a statement we 're not sure what the statement is but never mind so there 's really 
 this movie was one of the rolling on the floor laughing movies i have ever seen danny de plays owen perfectly is portrayed and was one of the of the the beginning of the movie it starts of differently then what you would expect larry is trying to write a book and is having some troubles larry teaches a writing class and owen after larry trying to get him to read his story owen eventually asks larry to kill his 
 this is a short film both james franco and deliver performances that hurt ring true and stay with you since this is called a story this is n't much of a but i wanted to change the outcome even though it is right for the story because i had already come to care about these people i can only think of a few short films that have had that effect on me shot acted high work all around even to 
 not knowing what this film was about i it out at the video store and after seeing it i enjoyed it little seen from director bernard rose great story and characters as a fan of 's i was surprised of her british the only exception for this film was the ending however it is worth the rent 
 this film ai n't half bad it may be a little long at times but carried along by beautiful an beautiful love letter and great actors you forget time and enjoy the grand prize however goes to and as well that would be telling but they are just great 
 i expected to enjoy a romantic comedy featuring but was disappointed on many levels first of all the story is so badly recycled as to make it almost second the setting acting and story are not very or third there are a lot more good black actors to choose from than these standard picks how about some third there were very few played in if any none really central overall film was a great disappointment but the style was very 
 what a pleasure this is really a only french people can do that kind of thing without being and as a result you spend a really good time watching jean playing the most of the movie stands on his and he has them wide enough to make this movie a good one he has the perfect way of the james bond kind of guy that he is no match for mike in austin powers for example the are also good 
 yesterday i finally satisfied my and saw this movie my knowledge of the plot was limited to about N seconds of the but i had heard some good critics which caused my expectations to i saw the movie those pieces had been combined in a story that was becoming quite intriguing with some apparently details but in the end everything is disclosed as a simple succession of events of bad luck in above everything i felt that the story made 
 please save your money and go see something else this movie was such piece of i want to go but i had to so i thought i 'd at least once not a single it was that horrible chris will never get a good comedy role after this and a night at the this movie is completely obvious has no smart humor at all and just itself over and over again listen to me and as far away from this 
 prior to seeing show people my impression of silent comedy was essentially and only i could not imagine how screen comedy could be possible without relying heavily on spoken word or numerous but this film proved me wrong in my view was probably the greatest actress to come along prior to ball i mention primarily because ' and reminded me of her to the point that i wonder if was n't one of ball 's primary influences this is coming 
 overall the 's army movie is very funny although the is n't quite as and as in the tv and radio series so where does this leave us the viewers if you 've never seen 's army then the movie is a good way of bringing yourself up to speed and getting on the mad world of the downside is that you might not get it because as i said the in the movie is a bit on the 's 
 the ancient is a truly classic piece of work as the original the with the old himself is fine clear and without the artistic work that the reading of the fits perfectly the of the setting and of the work itself carrying the audience into the period with a still yet moving using excellent strategies only well by the era producers and much less apparent in more current works brought to television and video a movement that races through often 
 margaret mitchell in her grave every time somebody watches this mess fine and sets ca n't even begin to lackluster performances by as the title character and the timothy as even worse than the acting and perhaps partially explaining it is the script which is and predictable add to that bad script a score that 'll have you and you 've got a disaster i would n't wish on any is just and i ca n't imagine how it ever 
 for those of you who have read 's highly respected novel this film will definitely you because of how an it is with the exception of one minor 's feature film debut is an almost recreation of the book down to the last line those of you who have not read the novel this movie might be a little tricky it is certainly not a large drama story instead it has a strong element of to it but i would 
 this was neither nor made the whole thing played out like a conspiracy theory by ibm to win the match in question just to make some money kasparov has an problem he was up before the match and when he lost he did n't like it i remember playing against computers back in the and it was n't too difficult to win as time went on i started to lose and did n't like it today i simply do n't 
 the plot of the story and the performance of the lead actors are very much the between two boys on the screen was done in good taste you can easily to their if you are one but if you are not one you can appreciate the kind of love the film is trying to 
 in europe it 's known as who wins in america it 's known as the final option but under any title this action asks the audience to put their to one side for around two hours i find it hard to how lewis collins the hero here was almost chosen as roger moore 's successor in the bond films this guy is so he 'd struggle to get a job in a museum as a davis is on hand to 
 i really enjoyed this thought not quite so much as the english patient a classic the first N minutes or so feel but as law on the back to his love the film picks up in and and it becomes a very romantic drama apparently it is fashionable to hate at the moment but i do n't agree at all and she does well here i actually think that the between and is developed in the script they really don 
 it 's hard to this movie because i dislike the story itself and no amount of good acting would have saved it think raising arizona with a mean streak the acting is but is way over the top yet not enough to make this a nice camp film as usual coming in somewhere between and a employee the rest of the cast have their in either from the stress of their parts or the stress of the whole exercise a 
 i was expecting to view a more style of film but unfortunately this turned out to be just a badly made low budget action that just does n't have the talent for that story is about a very beautiful woman named marshall thomas who 's rick jeffrey works for a secret agency and he has invented a that is bullet proof and can shoot and and has a that can shoot as well the head of the agency martin has 
 decent action scenes but the movie is with a slow nearly dialogue that leads to minimal character development and a seriously horrible did i mention that the made no sense but in its defense the action scenes were impressive enough even if they leave you your head as to why they just 's not much else to say about the movie it 's a action that makes no sense it 's like watching a worse version of the and all 
 men of honor features cuba jr. in what is probably his best performance to date he plays carl a man of and he 's a poor farmer from the south who wants to become a navy but has problems because of his race the head of the school played by robert is a that nonetheless grows to respect the film is about how has to the nearly odds not once but twice the performances are what make this film special 
 i really must have caught a different film from the rest of the on this site because at a of the film last night the audience was so by the that i 'm not even half walked out shot as if the thought he were approaching some new territory by a homosexual story the film david lynch inspired with inspired acting the performances in this film are so and that i figured one of the actors was going to pass 
 at least for me i have been following the career of mr. since the beginning and i was not crazy about this film i think cruz was the type of woman she is portraying does not look that good she makes the character also the scene was just weird i do not get the point and the was another thing that drove me are the why people coming from the same place have such a different the difference between the 
 earned his fame on the small screen though the big screen has not lost him any either is a fun just like on the small screen he has lost none of his character or at all and behind all that none of the film is either a human side to is revealed during the film the idea of running for is a brilliant fresh and funny one and the of ' man is mixed well with the stern harsh world 
 i loved this film when i was little today at N it is one of my all time favorite films beautiful and appealing characters are just two of the things to like about this film although many people might not enjoy some of the most of them are and go along with the story it focuses on charlie a german who may seem to some at first but eventually will win you a film by any means often very dark 
 i like the wind and the lion very much it was a good movie i thought that since i 'm young and it was made so long ago i would n't like it all that good but after i saw it i was of how good it was my family liked it my friends liked it everyone i showed it to liked it i liked it because it showed how arabs and people in was treated during the early N

 this kid is rather bad but in no way do they make him the type that adults and can experienced thieves at every turn no he is not so much a as he is a kid with severe emotional problems a nice couple looking to adopt get rather into adopting him and while the husband is a bit more willing to give this kid a chance the mother is not through in a bizarre michael character and the always and 
 i wo n't argue with anyone who this film as is january jones 's performance but please check her out if you have n't already in the tv series men starting later this month she 's excellent as is the entire cast i 'll assume she took on the role strictly for the money and what a mess it was going to be turned in a minimal acting job to avoid do n't know if that 's the case but 
 michael jackson is an artistic phenomenon his short movies music are simply the best i do not care if i get a feature from this man but i do care to get a of his crazy cool crowd and some of and there also should be a few everything i 've mentioned is here stupid plot and fair are not a problem when i witness michael jackson in action to me he will always be the ultimate king of music 
 as we are well aware movies are not set out to be a direct of history but it is a when a movie is made which has absolutely little to no i wish the director the screen writer had done research in this topic all this movie does is create a forum for hate between people while causing a that should not be there this movie portrayed the and in a very negative while making the third group look as 
 story of a strange love and a fall desire about beauty and his fear and of and and an venice n't know if it is a a or the reflection of a film director 's world it is absolutely a and a exploration of illusion a old mirror of limits signs and death 's a trip in an old space and death is a 's trip copy in the immediate reality and the is the music a soft sweet music 
 i 'm N years old a and over the last years i 've been in four it 's all there the fights the the food the worse always little or no money and every one was drunk or high but the clubs the fans and the music made it all worth it just like strange fruit i 'm too damn old for it now and the in the hands and mean no more but for the length of that video 
 let me start off by saying that i loved the original it was bar none one of the most i 've ever had in a filled movie theatre i 'm not being a also made the look better in my eyes if the setting had been changed to some american suburb i probably would 've ended up the film said this movie is a complete mess i wo n't say it because a the movie does have some good points 
 i once lived in the and let me tell you what i did n't have the idea what the this bear walk is i never heard of it the whole N years i was up there it was really funny in the beginning but went down hill quickly 
 this film was made soon enough after karen 's passing that perhaps richard carpenter and the people to karen were feeling a little guilty as to how they may have contributed to her health problems as the years have passed almost N to be exact it must have gotten easier to deny any richard has spent the years after karen 's death and the he made with her he married his mary and from what i have read it looks 
 you know a movie is bad when the highlight of it is being able to see a brief moment of jeopardy thing about white men ca n't jump is that it had tremendous potential for several years i lived in area quite like that portrayed in this film racial were high and basketball meant everything to everyone a film about the members of this basketball culture could have been very interesting but the acting and poor script in white men 
 you just touch the new crop is just awful the jokes are not funny some of the make me want to stop watching tv all together you have let your creation go down the toilet the guests sometimes are good the are mostly garbage weekend update has to tell the audience when to would get a proper reception in a though make sure andy goes with him the show has about N jokes in all and they just keep them 
 stephen king by king himself in which a young family newcomers to rural maine find out about the pet cemetery close to their home the father dale then finds out about the ground beyond the pet cemetery that has powers of only of course anything buried there comes back not quite average picture starts out and and continues that way for a while with the worst element being 's performance it gets a little better toward the end with disturbing 
 the script seems to have been wholesale cough cough borrowed from a certain other movie involving using a drilling machine scene by scene the two movies were almost identical just enough of the serial numbers filed off in this one to prevent a copyright infringement other than that i have to say i found this somewhat entertaining as i enjoy of movies it 's a little bit on the stupid side as far as the science goes but if one 
 i 've never been a fan of until now she was truly amazing in this movie the she must have gone through shooting after does n't thinking about this was a very hard movie to watch the subject matter is and you feel so just sitting and watching a woman being abused for what seems like an i actually felt that the whole thing somewhat when her friends returned to the house and i did n't find the conclusion at 
 but like the disney film of two generations ago this film fails as well in the department but at least disney used a the true story to mundane for movie producers i do n't think so there is ample to accurately they true story instead of the accounts we have had to suffer through some day a movie will bobby 's owner john gray as the that he was and bobby 's license a being paid for by the lord 
 is a great film the four young foster and are wonderful the song on the radio by summer is lovely a great film 
 i returns and this one both of the films are absurd with poorly written characters and bad voices the voices could have been done but returns was worst than this because of the they drew 's land was great and so was the original drama the only good thing about this film was the was alike of the classic and a funny line like when they were talking about things that are not real and then walks by the window 
 it 's strange how the least known movies sometimes end up the best you 've seen this movie has all the elements of a standard modern day guns cash etc and yet it stands out from your average hollywood i would credit this to two very people christopher has a cool confidence and is one of the and women i 've ever seen on screen another major reason why this film stands out is the setting shifts to jamaica after 
 you know this is be a movie when it was made it the N 's it 's in black and white it has no name actors makes up for the lack of special effects well not to be this movie incorporated all four of the above elements to turn this into a true but i am discuss special effects here or lack of them did you catch the scenes it looks like it was poorly through an note the in

 this is a that means there are no characters as such they are all plain and the movie relies completely on the quality of the there are quite some good jokes in this movie unfortunately they are hidden in a mass of real stupid ones if one expects all to be absurd the fun wears see there is american pie N my all time favorite movie it contains a lot of real original characters maybe the jokes are but all 
 what makes this special from a perspective is its which the audience to in the of music it the form of while a of sound and movement that invites us to the similarity found within the traveling music of historically traveling the film itself is a single take of sweeping movement that the globe and from one culture to the this film one 's breath is taken away by the simple beauty in our common connection to music and dance 
 the movie was certainly true to the real life story on which it was based it was hard for me to find newspaper articles about the actual facts but when i located them i could see that truth in this case was than light was evil in her role as the mother in this movie so much so that it was difficult to separate her from the role the mark i think of an excellent performance rick schroder was as 
 this movie has made me a and coach larry fan the story 's characters slipped and fell before they begin to grow as they struggled through strong conflicts those were and completely like life there were no easy answers for the problems facing them all actors and an excellent script brought this true story to life i wish there were more movies like this one these days i watch almost exclusively true stories because they are typically far more interesting

 watch this movie just to see khan say i love you it 's both and at the same time when he says this from the beginning to the end this movie made him famous and i totally recommend it d it 's highly entertaining the music 's and you will right along with here you 'll feel scared for the hero and and oddly enough you will identify with at least one of the characters you will feel sad and 
 this was one of the best half-hour shows of the without a doubt granted the show had a barely capable cast with every single episode and it as far as production values the sets went but it i have to give it some credit for being with the i mean the plot of each episode was enough that even i a movie and N 's got a little and out great show just great regardless of what the other have 
 the story is quite original but the movie is slow building up to the point where they steal the cars its nice though to watch them prepare the stealing too but the actual stealing should 've been more in picture however the work on this movie was excellent and it is a movie you have to see 
 was very to see the movie at the international film festival it was the opening night and was such a movie it was shot around india and i want to go there now the main actor was absolutely incredible he was the highlight of the movie apparently he was also in the movie he was the total star of the show 's character me up was very funny and the girl forget the name was great too they were all 
 watch this movie it 's truly a good ride through the difficulties of making a movie and what happens when it up in the film maker 's face there 's a lot of stuff about rock and the philosophy behind that movement and it 's relationship to this project so if you 're into old american you 'll dig it but there 's a ton of bad acting from the failed project that are incorporated yet they do come off 
 the film concerns a classic theme in fact it concerns the theme by batman from beginning to end but in real data and details the mayor of new york and very and dynamic in order to get some project through slightly faster than normal yields to some pressure from some private business contractors about a criminal drug dealer who should have been sent and kept in prison and he the judge in his turn to set him free on in

 everyone if you saw in the rain you remember the scene of gene kelly in the rain you also remember the dance number of donald make if you saw royal you will remember fred on the ceiling if you saw rock you will even remember the title dance number by the king is what is missing here there could have been some blockbuster dance numbers in this presentation the was chuck 's i can do that the mere fact that 
 watched N out of N & brian smith and supposed to the original classic N ' yes the movie continues where it ended in the first one but the problem is that it plays out much like the original one of the great things about the original was the of the story which this one does n't have the is also very for disney and all we get is the same characters going the same kind of story all over

 a story of amazing the over and over again the characters and plot are completely as is 's mad camera work which is usually a factor in his films and any grasp of is nowhere to be found it 's out to an degree by the end you wo n't be with excitement but with and like me maybe an urge to fall 's performance deserves in a better movie there 's just not much going on in the

 i loved this movie it was almost the same as the first by the lake only instead of just killing women he men also and the scenes are much more interesting N of my favorite scenes are when stanley and are in the dance club and he is describing 's last moments before she is thrown to the water and when stanley is visiting in his right before they head down to the set when she him those scenes for

 what is with all of the european especially england comments here all i got say is that when i saw this movie for the first time when i was like N i thought it was great of course it 's stupid that 's the point you have to see the movie dr. and men in black to get the whole joke behind this movie but come on people what did you expect to see i can think of many movies

 i had seen lady with red hair back when it appeared and did n't remember it as something to the truth is that notwithstanding its base in a true story its screen play is silly and the real merit of the picture is the cast a of some of the best supporting players of the N 's and N 's make a background for the delicate work of the always hopkins and the wonderful spectacular performance of who as usual

 it starts off pretty well with the accident and the decision not to return to la but everything falls into place too quickly there is a decent plot twist the end but so many scenes that do n't make sense played by brian austin green comes home angry and ready to people and he takes the time to put on the club when he parks his car in front of his house in the middle of nowhere i do n't 
 i tried to remove anything that might be considered a i also assume that you 've seen the first movie or at least know the general so if you have n't some of this might not make this movie the audience over the head with tired again and again in an attempt to get the theme across we are again and again by questions of purpose and and choice and forced to endure the long sessions that contain from a

 from the very beginning the political theme of this film is so obvious and heavy handed that the outcome is entirely predictable any good on writing will advise of characters character and three act structure in this film you will find none of that the police are the and consequently are shown as incompetent and it never seems to occur to the makers of this film that police might be citizens who see joining the police as a good way

 i have no idea how anyone can give this movie high marks i did n't rent it thinking it was the next great the next great or the next great obviously this is n't meant to scare but one fatal flaw with the production entirely the out of the experience the sound was horrible i had to work the volume control the entire movie you can imagine how difficult it is to get into something even a when you 're 
 the story is and poorly written we are given and a possible hook in act one only to see it had the writer bothered reading his work carefully it have been apparent that 's character 's initial problem and meeting with the ' girl suggests that there will be a troubled alliance between them as they try to solve his problem goes nowhere the relationship goes nowhere and there is no sexual tension in any of the relationships digs anyone

 i got by the title i was expecting an and intriguing into instead i got a rather boring and story about a leading character is n't given much psychological unless you are willing to as was a shame because the core of the story could have been good with a better effort to the inner feelings of a man who had to live with alcohol and violence since his the general idea seems to be more like i 'm the

 this has got to be the most stupid film i have ever seen ahead first of all the plot is stupid the little kid is weird and they move to a hotel because his father is the of it we find that the kid has a gift the this gift never ever has anything to do with anything except to make the kid seem cool then the movie gets more boring and boring until the man finally goes crazy he

 i had the honor this evening to see a of the movie these at the philadelphia film festival going into the movie i knew very little about it and just took a chance on it because the film 's plot sounded interesting so as i entered the theater just hours ago i what the final verdict would be up or down these is the story about three best friends from a small town is the who basically does n't know 
 here 's what you have to remember about this movie it 's a kids movie i do n't know about the rest of you but i 'm an child i was with rainbow so naturally i love this movie but if you watch the other rainbow movies this one is by far the best but like i said it 's a kids movie you have to judge it as a kids movie it does n't matter to kids if the 
 this movie was well done but it also made me feel very down at times as well for anyone that is considering show business this is a must see as it shows the raw deal in what goes on for these struggling workers the was definitely cool and the acting and it some of the student 's attitudes might have been a little like 's especially because i 'm sure someone like that would 've been kicked out immediately for 
 i really wanted to love this movie and not only cause it had in it but i thought the would be cool cause i enjoy movies and shows that around chefs the was good but besides it being around chefs everything else is just very oh and little miss was very in this movie although seems to be a bit in every movie she is in cause she plays a lot of roles where she is it has some decent

 i 'm no director or writer or anything related to a movie but watching more than N movie everyday has given me the idea of what is a good movie or not so here it is the quick and the is a of the quick and the dead i was thinking that it could be a little bit of a of a cool movie with lots of starts in it but oh no i was really in for an very 
 i had seen in a couple of movies and really could n't understand her appeal she could n't dance for peanuts she did n't attempt to and as for her acting she seemed in a but i had n't seen her silent and this film is wonderful rather than her own image as has been suggested here to me it seems a on who did start off in went on to highly emotional women 's pictures and did end up 
 this movie is a pile of and to try and base it the first is just a the main thing that let it down for me was the usage of the one out of the first one which once said by classic actors such as sam can not be in any way i mean when phones wade in the and he ends the call with stay cool that was great but when the the agent back home and he ends 
 what was an exciting and fairly original series by fox has down to during the first season dark was on my weekly must see list and not just because of the over at fox decided that they needed to the within N episodes of the season they had totally lost me as a not even to see i found the new characters that were added in the second season to be too ridiculous and the new were stretching the and 
 if you enjoy the yes i said actions and reactions of john candy you ca n't help but like this film by the and always saw candy as a broad actor a big and sometimes he was see and but when given the opportunity he could really be and quite it 's too bad he was cast in so many roles that only showed his broad side because we 'll never get to see more of the other oh the 
 i 've seen this film more than once now and there 's always someone complaining about the obvious construction of the plot but then this is part of 's game he plays along with the rules of 's very nice how the highly story of how the two meet is again in another even more story that the make up for a casting this film is a between fact and it 's more about things that might have happened in 
 i think this is a pretty good movie but one thing makes it very interesting to me it is obvious once you look out for it the main characters in this movie are the for the on the is john is and tony is there is even an episode of the where uses the line i her with a stick the connection is the most obvious with the hat and long hair and the voice has the head unlike john 
 remember the good ' batman show from the N 's the one that people praised the one that people of all ages could all appreciate the one that showed batman as a real instead of the in a bat suit the one that had you could to the one that had with real well clearly warner bros. does n't hence this do these people know anything about batman have they even looked at a batman comic before do they know 
 i knew it would be a bad movie when i it but i hoped for a good bad movie oh well had fun making fun of the endless sand eating well actually and weird acting from i think it was about five actors the needs a director 's commentary so that i can find out what he was thinking or if he was at all i ca n't believe they actually went to england and wherever to film this could

 i have seen the perfect son about three times i fail to see how this film is a film i am not even but i do n't see it as a film it is a film with a character i ca n't see why every film with a character should be strictly a film about being i find the film to be sympathetic to the study of death the death of someone who is your i think turns his life 
 and will keep you on the edge of your seats i do n't typically go for movies but this was worth my was serious but it was also 's character proved to be and honest no matter what you know that he 's got your 's character developed throughout the film he was n't just a suit he definitely proved that he could be a hero and handle a ending through me a little though it did n't really go 
 i will warn you here i chose to believe those who said that this was n't an action film in the usual sense rather a psychological drama so you should appreciate it on that basis and you will be am here to tell you that they were wrong completely no not completely it is very disappointing if you are looking for an action they were right about that but it is also very on all other levels as was n't 
 i 've seen some terrible in my day but this one tops them all the cast from the story which is in itself to the book mr. is nothing like as for a appearance makes this a difficult one to sell to a sympathetic audience is nothing like the one reads about in the original text and james appears in the film far too little to leave the with any understanding of his important role in the story also as 
 the story on the island bob who makes a photo shoot for a magazine meets the her free spirit and for life bob who has suffered a very experience shortly before her life is not so simple as it seems however through bob gets in a dangerous network will be able to win his trust review the dialogue in this movie is very natural and the story although it stays a bit on the surface and it would have been 
 i doubt much of this film is based on a true story at the beginning it says based on a true story sort of i bet the only truth to it was there was an turned hunter possibly named it begins with talking to who works for the fbi is being about what she knows about a theft of N million dollars through we see as a child then as a model and how she became interested in being a 
 i watched this last night on altman must be the most hit or miss director of note ever this show despite its star power is utterly and its political which i as a proud liberal in no way disagree with are and and seem from the of usa today despite the fact it 's coming out of the mouth of someone as as mario the drama as such is not very dramatic and the comedy is not funny the only 
 not the best of the 's but not the worst either i feel guilty laughing at this film considering it had to be career lows for all involved yet the acting dialogue scenarios and the ever present boom get to me and certainly add to its bad movie as much of a linda blair fan i am top or go to also special to henry who 's the only one in the cast who does n't play his role too 
 the film shows relations of the dying mother and the son who is very attached to her and definitely her what does it show it shows their living in very poor conditions it shows how they walk really he is bringing her but what do we see further after their he walks alone at the same places where they walked together it is not possible a person who love and care about another dying one would do everything to make 
 batman returns is more and than its predecessor and i like it a lot also the is more and the entire environment is along with the music composed by the danny i did n't like the idea to make the a monster unlike to the comic books where he 's human even if he looks like a monster he shows well that he a human dignity and i felt very sorry for him when he saw the of his late 
 this was a character 's movie the plot was n't that hot when it was there but the characters were interesting and very the story focuses on the family in the wake of the son 's i say that because the story is mostly about the surviving son and the mother because if the father was supposed to have the story focus on him too they the movie pretty poorly the acting on all parts was very good particularly as 
 i knew absolutely nothing about before my of it i did n't know anything about the story the cast the director or anything about the film 's history all i knew was it was a french film had i known more i probably would n't have viewed the picture with an open mind on paper the does n't sound interesting to me had i known what was about ahead of time my interest while watching would have been limited however 
 is just stunning at times and for me the only reason to watch this silly film despite the was one of the women of hollywood in fact for a couple of years i ca n't imagine anyone that looked better except maybe elizabeth taylor in her the of the show gene kelly does not play his normal at least the kind of guy we all know him from in ' in the rain here kelly 's danny much of the

 this was by far the best war ever made from the very beginning of the first episode when sir laurence described the events in day the soldiers came ' to the final days of the war when the clouds appeared over japan i never missed a second of this classic series and i remember it well even though it was way back in each and every aspect of this tragedy was covered in detail this whole series should be for 
 from hardly to an school style shuttle crash is better classified as a mix of fake blood and the almost style of the film seems to be a failed attempt to recover from a lack of or effective story the acting however is not nearly as many of the young actors a hidden talent particularly don and jamie who shed a well needed of light on this otherwise terrible film would have never shown up on set had he known 
 this movie was and even with a less than convincing ending it 's still well worth seeing the film begins as is about to robert when the minister asks if anyone has any objections a guy up and that ca n't get married because she already is married insists this is n't true but when they investigate they find that the justice of the peace and many others remember her and there is even a signed license slowly it becomes 
 i first saw this film around ten years ago and i thought it was very funny indeed it was not as bad as some critics were making it out to be the fact that it was written by the usually john hughes shows that you can at least expect some funny dialogue by the way i also think weird science is quite good which was also in speed by hughes film has a very look to it using all the

 i was rather to see the low rating this movie received here personally considering it fun family fare it around a young who is sent by his mom to key to spend the summer with his uncle porter while there he a named lots of amid the predictable uncle as well as a little for with a local 'm a great fan myself so absolutely loved paul in his role as and uncle porter for he keeps an endless stock 
 with and filled with is so much more than the drama we 've all come to expect this is almost a silent film with what dialogue there is in german and highly german at that perhaps the intended the film to reach the possible european audience as anyone with even a little high school level can easily with the the story is of little importance anyway with the film succeeding on a level not a one of and the power 
 this movie was n't just bad it was terrible after i watched it i actually felt the need to take a to get the off of me there is running ' with an elderly couple making out it is not funny but it is the monster make up was cool but that is all the errors alone will have you angry at least i was the is really anything else you could possibly do would be better than spending time 
 eddie is nothing short of a and this is eddie at his very best his material is extremely and and his delivery is some of the best ever on stage instead of the audience 's intelligence he relies on it to draw humor from his preferences the moon landing and the british with so many one ca n't help but repeat some of his lines forever more do you have a flag should be considered one of the lines ever 
 this is by far the worst movie i 've ever seen from the plot though the shots the special effects the acting and did i mentioned the plot every single thing in it this is a good example of what means and i 'll try to explain i understand what the of this movie was trying to do this was supposed to be one of those movies you ca n't really tell what the hell is going on up until 
 i admit creating great expectations before watching because some friends mentioned it and they are not as a must see and it is a must see just do n't expect to see something are interesting in many parts of the film but there 's just too much and it does n't stick in the of the good things are the of 's blue most of david lynch 's some of 's and perhaps a couple more i missed i just 
 this movie is actually worse than most movies i 've ever suffered through and i 've suffered through a lot nonsense it 's got terrible forced dialogue plot developments really drawn out ' scenes which look more like a high school art project than a movie at best attractive women long boring sex scenes involving said women forget what you know about especially ones with fake difficult to understand speech from some of the characters and they actually used the

 when taken as a whole for its ideas and of the current system and political process i think this is a great film granted the movie was not the comedy i expected but once i got over that this film really made me think so much of what we see and hear in to any election is such a joke there is in particular a debate scene in this movie that i felt was a of our political debates and 
 first of all excuse my bad english of course only a movie simpson can include serious like this i 'm a norwegian and i felt and shocked the makers of this movie did not take the time to do their research upon making this norwegian movie even is more accurate when it comes to facts about this i 'm posting my out of my frustration country is named norway not is russian not norwegian never use those black with that

 while this is n't an all time classic comedy it is a pretty good little movie to watch if you catch it on a saturday morning with not a lot else going on right lloyd plays an american coming home after growing up in china where his was a has come home from china to find an american wife and plans to return to china to continue his father 's is recruited to run for mayor of his corrupt home 
 what an disappointment the score of N N here on built up some mild expectations but oh my was i disappointed the first thing that bugs me are those university kids yes i know can be and so on but why are they in movies always portrayed as complete there was one character that i thought was but not it here was killed off way before the end the other characters was poorly executed and even the supposed just did

 i saw the movie last night and i really wanted to like it my expectations for the movie had been going up and down ever since i heard it was being made some days i 'd see something spectacular and some days i 'd be being the kind of fan i am i had high hopes for this movie but in the end i was i love the richard movies i did n't like their sometimes nature or the changes 
 i had the pleasure of watching this two chairs down from one of the executive producer at the atlantic film festival which was interesting because he at very different times than the rest of in atlantic canada the movie is about three who in one of their last of their youth devote a large deal of energy to sleeping with a married old man despite much 's definitely worth a watch but the was geared a completely different than the

 east is widely known as john candy 's last movie as he died on the set that 's just what makes it so sad not simply that candy suffered a fatal heart attack but that it was on the set of such a movie seriously i do n't know what they were thinking when they came up with this piece of but the has no it 's as if they took every unused script for stupid and just mixed them 
 this movie starts out enough and there is a moment where i thought to myself this is going to be really good however it gets rather boring rather quick at the end the acting is fairly good as is the location and the story starts out rather well too the problem not enough on screen and an ending where you have the monster basically turning and running i wanted to see more especially after a very good sleeping bag scene 
 is a good actor and when he 's not a family film a fine director but he really should n't have directed this movie and the should 've been rejected the director and writers must understand what the original tv show was really about as well as who the characters were and how they worked the original series had many episodes with writing using good dialogue and with situations that american producers would never consider using in children 's programming 
 this movie was so heart warming a true to an actors real life everyday ups and was truly a wonderful experience to share the passion of the actor on film and respect for what it must have taken off screen this film is a reminder to everyone to go for there dreams never give up for the stand

 this is a unique and bold film it 's energetic with highly developed characters very good performances i love directors who are not afraid to ask the audience to think carr to look ask questions and dig the surface by the nature of the film it practically demands that the look as well it can take some to do this i can see how some people might find this quite disturbing however i found it much more than just carr 
 my question is what was the worst element of this movie was it the acting script maybe it was the waste of alan and jack and especially are capable of bringing extreme to a role in this movie it was hard to tell who the bad guy was granted was playing an good guy but even in his good guy roles he could be very so the net result was a potentially good movie of any feeling of conflict

 the film is somewhat entertaining but the greatest feature is 's performance it has been N years since this movie was released and hopefully has gone through more training perhaps she should stick to the more somewhat characters that she has generated in other performances 
 it 's always interesting to view a movie after hearing so much from other fans experience has taught me that you should never fan taste within a my expectations of this movie were a great deal higher than my viewed should n't play with dead things is a movie with a good intended plot that trips up too many times to carry it out the whole idea of a band of actors staging a of dead had me however everything 
 boring as hell and kind of a 's the story of a woman who struggles with the concept of marriage as a business arrangement the romantic nature of a one night stand and the uncertainty and of true of the story 's are of other recent movies the english patient but have far less the first half-hour i started checking my watch wondering if i 'd make it home in time to catch on passed up to see this 
 ok so is n't deep and meaningful like or as big budget as N but on the whole i found it quite fact that kurt russell stayed in character not speaking and being virtually made the moments when his broke through all the more i found his portrayal of restricted emotional development more than 's in the films and before i get comments yes i know that was a and kurt was human but the put forward by both films 
 the question when one sees a movie this bad is not necessarily how did a movie this bad get made or even why did i see this awful in the first place but what have i learned from this experience here 's what i learned just because the rules of movies have been and times in the last ten years does n't mean someone wo n't go ahead and make a movie that uses all of them without a of 
 roy is not steve or but then who is the is one of the better movies even today and is second only to 's and the harry series which is n't bad company there are three things that seem to make a good movie script with great acting great car chase scenes and some heavy action this movie has all three and the car chase scene is better than that in harry plays the head of a group of out 
 this film was bad bad acting bad bad writing but it was n't bad in a funny way it was bad in a boring way i watched surface to air because i thought it might be a it was n't do n't make the mistake i did there are plenty of more ways to spend an hour and a half such as watching dry or reading the seriously 
 this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen i was going in expecting a movie but at least with some cool car what i got was nothing the racing scene are so low budget they them up to make it look like the cars are going fast in one scene a mercedes goes from over N to N in like N seconds by just around in circles its just you see a real movie about cars see 
 i 'm glad i never watched this show when it came just why it lasted N years it me of the terrible N 's with fake people fake clothes and fake music how did i ever survive growing up in this era the acting in the majority of episodes i have watched are forced this makes for very boring shows the plot lines are not very interesting as the old zone shows the old show inspired the and made one 
 i really thought that this movie was not only is the history correct but the style is and yet intimate i was a fan of blunt 's portrayal of and how she kept her spirit even though she was forced into a while in her youth blunt the and sometimes manner that became famous perhaps for the romantic elements of the movie are so genuine and tender that by the end of the movie you understand why chose to live 
 i do n't recommend watching this movie it 's a movie in which a movie is being with no attraction between actress and actor being played the sex scene at the end of the movie which is to explain the reluctance of the actress being played in the movie to cooperate with the actor being played in the movie in it is a blunt of the same scene in the movie fat girl everything there was played with more if 
 this movie states through its that the world is essentially and pain and those that ignore this have on one can argue whether this is true or not but even if you accept this as true the movie 's ending either a disputes this by saying there can be some good in situations or b this and uses a in order to leave the audience feeling the movie its by him as a sympathetic character despite any evidence for that 
 on one level this film can bring out the child in us that just wants to build and throw stuff in the air just for the of seeing it fall down again on a deeper level though it a desire to with the land i with the artist when he said when i 'm not out here alone for any length of time i feel i considered andy one of the great contemporary artists i 'm familiar with his works 
 this film is an attempt to appeal to a younger of to N ' and an to all of them i refuse to believe that that age group is that as to be by this unnecessary early in the film one of the characters i am surrounded by this is the moment in the film which goes steadily down from there full of and events the film is also full of characters who are not exactly a formula all too 
 really i think this movie is more an example of an easy target than a truly bad film in fact the movie is done very well in many and is very the script is a little but that 's the the film has a atmosphere centered around a just like all the old this too has a that you around so that you do n't always know how to make sense of it at first and it can be a 
 friends i 've never seen such a trash movie as night of the N it seems that the director kevin had the intention to copy like the evil dead by sam N or george a.

 may contain a few weeks after i had originally wrote my review for of the living dead i realized that i may have been a bit too harsh on this movie which is why i decided i would do something i had never done before review the same movie again do n't get me wrong i still do n't like the movie i still think it 's and i still think the do n't look all that the story in 
 one is to define the of de 's movie as event of the thought ' following the example of the nominal is a certain bart 's for that substance which the of the script for his new movie is taking shape simultaneously on his computer and in his own this as a response to 's N ' and cost de N years of work playing with real and characters as well as with the audience it reveals the of the 
 a movie about dealing with the problems with growing up and being true to yourself blue is mind candy for those who like and is the real star of this film while the more famous zeta jones plays his girlfriend and plays his drug those who do n't like or in the you 'll find that it takes a long time before the movie even hints at being interesting the beginning is slow and spends too much time on long 
 makes usa look like now this one can only be recommended to us john supporters or members the message is very simple let 's shoot them all everything that is n't this is badly acted badly badly interpreted stupid but no fun at all this movie could be used as a device by cia sorry there ca n't be any us because they are the good

 i have to admit i did not finish this movie because it was so stupid and not worth watching i watched it with a room full of kids who also were not laughing at the stupid and crude humor the director bob seems to be so with and that it the real story that i grew up with this is not a good film for kids besides the fact that the content is so crude the movie is just stupid 
 is one of those films that with a little more acting a little more direction and a lot more story logic would have been quite compelling as a entry as it stands it is still a film that has solid and effects and a that the mood of in spite of itself and there are no getting killed one by one just adults so that is a change of pace and the plot line is similar to dead birds with 
 father of the pride was another of those good shows that unfortunately do n't have a very long life and that is pretty sad specially if you consider that almost all the time the worst shows are still on air think in the simple life i admit that are many with this show and the but despite the the show have it own merits the is just adequate not incredible but is good best are the characters all the animals 
 of is based on somewhat pat formula by now of japanese school drama the formula somewhat goes like this the main comes from world outside the normal society and has there 's a very beautiful and girl in a supporting a normal character is in there who shares the main role in the unusual things happens in an usual social sometimes the story is about the main and the normal character that to the existence or destruction of the absolutely 
 is definitely not a film most people would find amusing or even interesting for that matter there is no scene acting or plot development that would light a spark the world is one thing but plot is something you really ca n't bear the characters are not only they 're not even there is no and there is no sense in anything that goes on there is a world in ice where nobody is doing any meaningful work except playing 
 i also made the mistake of thinking that i was going to see the N with rush this was worse then a lot of student films that i have seen the script was forced the acting was and the it was so slow that i just managed to force myself into staying but i always give a movie a chance so i suffered until the very end apparently there was a memo out about this movie because my friend and 
 is an interesting film although i would n't use or do describe it it 's more a minor character study that seems oddly sympathetic of the serial killer jeffrey who murdered and his male victims the film centers on the relationship between and by is almost the more interesting character of and having once escaped an attack he returns to for sex and a second think the film is because it does little to 's years how events may have 
 i watched this movie really late last night and usually if it 's late then i 'm pretty of movies although i tried i just could not stand this movie at all it kept getting worse and worse as the movie went on although i know it 's to be a comedy but i did n't find it very funny it was also an especially and portrayal of rural life in case this is what any of you think country 
 short with no dialogue african girl and characters the lion and the what happens a lion wants to eat an african girl called there is also a rather confusing is he on 's or the lion 's side message my thoughts i agree with lee this is rather mean on poor african people i like how the main character who is an african girl is quite a nice main character but they still her and make a younger audience not 
 this middle class became the subject of much by the new breed of in the such as ben did it deserve such well terry and june was never it was never a tale with different which at the conclusion it was the show your mother and father and probably watched they rather than but they were never likely to be by the show so the fact that it never challenged them was foot in the grave suffered initially because it

 this has to be one of the top shows ever made and yes i was even shown the end of and that still made me hate it even more not to mention the of this show i do n't mind psychological and philosophy but it out into the like nothing else not many of the characters seemed to be very interesting the only ones that seemed to be interesting were and other than that mostly everyone else were a bunch 
 i am one of the biggest fans of silent and have probably reviewed more films for than any other person every film he made from the beginning of his career to the early with only two exceptions have i reviewed so you can tell i am a major fan it 's because of this that i found this episode so painful and hard to watch i loved this man 's films and kept thinking how could you well now that 
 aside from a few titles and the new holmes movie i think i 've watched every movie guy has directed twice to say i 'm a big fan and is one of the reasons why this movie is a very different approach from when you look at it with lock stock and sets us up for a psychological of sorts as a gambling con finds himself at the of a set of foes he did n't expect and a walk 
 richard 's big ' is a trip through backgrounds characters and a conclusion that nearly brings me to happy i see short i have seen over and over and over and i never tire of it having it on tape from a broadcast on tv it never stops to make me burst out in and then reach down into the of my spirit the of the human condition cause when someone says on let 's finish the game ' everything 
 this movie was excellent a bit scary but excellent at that for those of you that have heard of and know the story it gives you a idea of what and why these kids did what they did in the back of your mind you know that people think of this stuff but you never realize just how bad it is and this movie makes you realize it 's seriously that good it also makes you think twice before you 
 i think this is a load of all they do is argue and each other across the face and they call this acting these people get paid lots of money for this and most of them ca n't even act to save their lives also the story lines are awful and after watching it for a few minutes i am with it i like the way that harry hill takes the out of it on his tv show ' the 
 is a good word to describe this 's say every movie has a selling point a ' is the effects as well as fan boys in seattle 's is in their what if someone you never met someone you never saw someone you never knew was the only someone for you many relies heavily on these and some through draw of big names leap years employs both by using the irish as the and featuring considerably famous names within the 
 all this talk about this being a bad movie is nonsense as a matter of fact this is the best movie i 've ever seen it 's an excellent story and the actors in the movie are some of the best i would not give criticism to any of the actors that movie is the best and it will always stay that way 
 this movie is truly worth seeing robin and henry thomas proves that he 's one of those the child ' who grows up to become a real actor the characters are perfectly drawn and in the wrong hands because of their they could have been but all the actors are simply the cast of this movie has to rank up there with that of girl interrupted both movies star the brilliant the score and music fit perfectly and there is 
 this movie is a only upon multiple can one truly understand the of this film personally i enjoy the for his no subject left style of the introduction you right away and holds you at the edge of your seat throughout the film he provides wonderful insight into the world of the and allows the audience to really ' with internal this film the script itself holds the movie together not only for kids but the elderly alike will gain 
 this is one of the worst bullock movie since speed N but not quite that bad i really lost it with those out of the blue not so special effect guys if you 're an go with your girl to see this movie i give it three

 poor performances by martin and grossly supporting characters with no real plot ending leaves you than a with more loose ends than you could tie up in four that is if you even about these wooden characters is the only real asset that in which the chicago searches for the character is the music in that also is poor and in the final scene when martin 's character his hat for the woman he called a almost made me go

 it is an interesting fact that by and formal logic and form about those sciences that most people are not interested in but then around one thousand years after the computer began to the human thinking and the humans who were refusing to reflect questions of being other than biological physical and chemical ones suddenly felt because they could not cope with the consequences that this computers would bring over night 's am together with 's and 's is probably 
 what was this about you can not change the future cause it has already been written i 'll give it this much i did want to see what happened next and therefore watched the whole movie this movie took a concept and made it you 're looking for a recommendation see it at prices no but an interesting concept they should have left the reference out 
 i had planned to write something explaining what i did n't like about this movie but this is going to be more difficult than i thought i ca n't remember much about it i watched it just three days ago and it 's made almost no impression on me that 's usually the sign of a real about the only thing i remember was being by most of it the of having a bogart as the wore off real quick 
 i bought this set sight and wish i had n't the script needed some serious as it seems to be completely of any feeling and in comparison to the book the lighting is very but if it was just that i could it the script does n't focus enough on the characters there is hardly an introduction to various characters making it a difficult to who is who especially in the planes no idea who dies when have long felt 
 conventional wisdom is that a is seldom as good as the original movie there are exceptions but this is not one of them disney should have quit while they were ahead this was a real disappointment after a reasonably entertaining N 
 this is a brilliant political no wonder why it was largely ignored in the u.s. it our foreign policy for what it really good film from this era was also totally dismissed simply because it showed accurately that the u.s. is a war machine on and in its for total world plot good acting some big stars john ben anyone and some scenes of should have made this movie a hit unfortunately americans do n't like to hear the truth 
 i remember when i first heard about jack i was in video at with my family on a monthly video hiring tradition it was at this time that i worked up the to venture over the section of the store the various titles i finally came across jack the cover was enough to convince me that the film was beyond my years later the film disappeared only to be replaced with the inevitable yet unnecessary i once again to the 
 written and directed by is a little tale that speaks of respect for the ocean respect for humans young and old and respect for cultural differences it is a new tale of a little to be a girl rather than a of disney 's little has by hand a film for the young and the heart the film begins with a slow of sea and scores of little with faces there is n't any need for the motion of the

 i doubt was even at the time the whole theme married to a murder mystery being a obvious attempt to grab a young audience of the era without in the least truly showing any understanding of the the dated aspect aside from many problems including acting silly and dialogue that go on long even after the point has been home in the first N seconds a failure to create any true even though the actual plot is on paper a 
 is it just me or is this an awful film i 'm going with it 's an awful film knowing full well that it 's a guy usually defined as full of car crashes explosions etc i still expect some small degree of credibility if i ca n't somehow believe in the the film will not work thus we come to the problem with assault on not one for i never report details of the plot however i will make 
 i like kevin and and i love mary stuart but the movie was n't good at all there was n't a character in the picture and the plot was nearly is a great actress but she just did n't pull off the tough girl character she had similar problems with her character in the second day of christmas perhaps she should avoid these characters especially those with an female child to play off wood was her character was a plain 
 in love and war is a simple and should be viewed as such possible it is the story of a british captured with his by the and in a former as the surrender to the allies the is freed and attempts to however the germans arrive and the is captured again only injured remains at large the rest of the film how he is hidden and protected by the and his survival end of based on a true story in

 this movie changed the art of film making telling a complex story in a powerful new way the film with fantasy a modern war with strange scenes full of smoke the film uses music not as a score laid in later but as a practical part of the scene playing from etc uses a classic piece of literature as taking scenes and characters and putting them into entirely different that is a tricky and thing to do then he takes 
 in the opening of where 's george rises from his bed one morning puts on a suit and goes into his mother 's we realize later to give her a massive heart attack that will kill her and get her out of his life forever this is about the level of humor one can expect from most of this picture with what might be taken as plays a new york attorney who lives with his supposedly mother ruth gordon whose

 this was n't the worst movie i 've ever seen but i had heard lots of good things about it and i was disappointed i could see where the film makers were coming from and that they were trying to express the fact that the two sides in this battle were n't a whole lot different from one another that the individuals were getting lost in the fighting etc etc well that 's my anyway at any rate the movie

 i have loved this movie since i saw it in the theater in i was N then and was my favorite actor and crush i am now N and i still love this movie the best part about it is whoever i am dating it too because it is a total movie it is with enough action and to keep men with the attention to the screen i only wish that it was available on 
 a 's life is like a favorite candy bar it 's of great little that add up to something really story could n't have been better it 's has heart and every character has a nice a growth or change by comparison the only characters in toy story to have an are who to love being a toy and who his of there are tons of and moments in a 's life all of the actors turn in great voice 
 this story had the potential of a good film the difficult choice of love money and the and regret of making the wrong one however the movie was by the horrible of robert redford as the who offers $ N N N to sleep with moore like redford has to pay for it redford 's good looks and all american just do n't cut it as an threatening redford 's acting are insufficient to make his character i can see 
 even worse then the boring the of rose it started off and right up until the mom said to the see i knew she was in an i told you so voice it was a terrible line spoken badly and it the rapid demise of this bad movie every family member has an issue from the past with the the starts to accuse everyone of either his wife or actually having an affair with her with him killing his buddy

 the first time i watched it was when it came out N and the last time i watched it was just before writing this review it still makes me my brains out after all these years it not truly the comedy ever made this is one indian movie which deserves its place in the top khan and khan in probably one of their best performances in roles the thing that makes this one a time less classic is its comic 
 this was my first and probably the last movie i was eager to get into it as it featured one of my favorite actors and was a film by of whom i 've heard a lot the opening was promising a long shot over a jeep of soldiers across the border ok but that was all nothing left the movie had big and i do n't know which to mention first the main plot of the story is revealed to

 i saw this movie years ago in a group tradition of fast forward film where we would set out to rent a bunch of and vote for who picked the night we watched this it was voted the best due to of plot and fun is certainly a silly movie to be watched under the full understanding that you are watching personally however i would n't recommend additional this movie will leave it 's own mark on made enough of 
 even though the plot was very well detailed and the story line was the fact that steven voice was dubbed with some one else 's through out most of the movie was as you were who was talking there were many parts where he would start to talk in his deep voice and then the next some one else 's voice was doing the talking for him i do n't know the reason however if he had difficulty with his 
 the a of course the original was a psychological and one that has improved with time compared to this N it 's a classic there is no character development here only the the brain the i 'm get us here fellow the oh so sensitive but seeing as how the were banking on the special effects being the star i guess characters that you can with are a secondary concern unfortunately the effects are doors dead children that ca n't 
 water is a very beautiful movie i would put it straight under the wonderful short movie from mackenzie it 's not only about coming out but also about and acceptance in general i am looking forward to seeing more of laurel 's work in the future the actors and are quite good the main characters relationship could have been a bit as we understand there is a very strong bond between them but maybe this could have been explained a 
 not since j. michael 's N has a television show captured the wonderful art of applying a story to a television show this is easily the best thing on tv right now the characters are and one can easily get attached to them and care for their the are the type you love to hate and leave you wondering what they 're up to next and brian 's work is the most innovative out there to s. for a job 
 one of the problems with popular culture especially when discussing the popular culture of the is that mass media especially television is usually about four years behind ' media primarily music many people think the generation remained important throughout the actually it was all over at in by N ' rock or the ' had moved east to england and led black and david early and the so-called ' who were all and love ' not neither in a different 
 if you value your life in any way shape or form you will do yourself a and pass by this seemingly interesting movie on the know what you 're thinking i saw the and it looked great however buyer i fell into the same trap one of my friends expressed certain reluctance to watching this movie but i forced her to sit it out oh how i regret that most movies the movie starts out in a mexican resort where 
 this film was it provided a somewhat view of the british club scene which if you really look at it is a funny thing the characters in this were so realistic to those of us who watched here at my place that it was like watching a movie about were a few scenes which really made this movie work the getting ready scenes the get me a real doctor scene the white background scene showing each character in a total 
 i loved this movie the was the plot had some nice and turns and the characters were well on two fronts however roy scored far above average first i have rarely seen a popular film in which the quality of dialogue was so high there were many and to the i could give numerous examples but why should i just watch the film second this movie understood a principle rarely acknowledged any more for a drama to succeed it needs 
 this is truly a classic this film appears to have influenced arts films for decades the spanish background music the competing schools the high onto the of catching thrown cheating in the secret training for an exotic technique themes of patience and and more were by many later films such as the kid N hero N kill bill volume N N and N feel lucky to have first seen this film in N shortly after it was released just before 
 so where 's my i seriously expected a and to drop from my ceiling for watching a full N minutes of that comedy central is truly dropping the ball lately trying to fill the left by with multiple seasons of a man men if you pay attention to the show you 'll notice that when is n't over and laughing at his own he only makes which seem to lack any sense of humor you ever notice how people in 
 not sure if this is just a movie or if it was intended to be a of a b western story line was but the and acting were just plain bad plus the music in the background was to no end too loud and just many times you could not make out the over the background music i 'm in single action shooting society and do some old west shooting with them and a lot of the actors are members 
 there are many distinct problems with the movie for one there are way too many the husband is a hunter and just happens to be hunting on the day that the main killer shows up with someone the killer knows i will take that one the kid calls the real estate agency that the wife works for and asks for money to be ready when he comes to get it i will take that one as well before he goes

 karen goes into a japanese house as a substitute to a strange woman who at day and at night karen goes after hearing when she a ghost she will learn the house 's is very scary the scenes are and the characters are good the are i love the whole plot the ending was i at a scene where the little boy so to the man finding his sister and i was shocked this is the movie i have watched 
 this script was mildly original when it was written in N but the poor performances and the quality level make it impossible to recommend some of the are absolutely terrible and the dialogue is never natural a few of the plot were creative but i was very surprised to see it so highly rated here at the a few scenes are it 's as a film that if fails completely to if you like this sort of run do n't 
 if you 're a film student or were one or are thinking of becoming one the name has or will have a like other like although 's are not as as 's and has had such an impact on the history of it 's of course taken for granted the reason i bring up the film student part is because at some point whether you 'd like it or not your film professor N times out of N will show 
 i have seen high several times over the years and always found it was an with an odd sense of humor but i never knew that it was in the and i never knew that the actor that plays simon committed after the film was released i guess i did notice while watching it last night that the actors seems rather odd for americans and a few of them are n't very good at their english that aside though this 
 from germany and i love the i go N times a year tonight i saw it was a wonderful evening you mr. waters everybody who has a chance to see the movie go 
 i do n't know what would be so great about this movie even worse why should anyone bother seeing this one first of all there is no story one could say that even without a story a movie could be worth watching because it some sort of strong feeling cry fear but in my opinion this movie does not do that are just watching images for N there are more useful things to guess you could say the movie is 
 some movies are but still pulp others are simply boring this movie has an almost unique feature of being both utterly and totally boring by the end i did n't care about any of the characters i just wanted all of them dead so i could get out of the theatre 
 this movie is without a doubt the best i have seen in my entire life the star cast is only an added bonus over the amazing special effects and story and the movie is about an ancient love affair that down into the modern world two in incur the of a great and are subsequently the woman is born again on earth while she is in college she is and the rest of the movie basically focuses on the hunting

 this movie is a and it is pretty interesting this is a good movie based on the true story of how a bunch of norwegian managed to stop the heavy water production in norway and the of the rest of the heavy water to movie is n't perfect and it could have been a bit better the best part of the movie is that some of the are played by themselves if you 're interested in history of and film 
 i 'm not a big fan of at the best of times a few have been quite good check of dream for an but this one is just more of the same but a running time of i expect more than N every the only real are when male and friends help out lee 's i can say is avoid i there is at least N other movies on the shelf that deserve you $ $ N of out N 
 the photography was beautiful but i had difficulty understanding what was happening was there a lot of the N do they mean something in culture there 's not much plot not much happens and it just along no real start no real middle and no real end rather was difficult to get into the characters as you never felt you got to know them it was difficult to know which scenes were and which were real the move felt chaotic 
 this american came as near as popular art to be from its and title to the performance by william from the harold russell the film both the dream and the reality of the postwar world this intimate with the psychological facts of american life gave it an almost universal audience but unlike contemporary and preceding message pictures it was not a it showed americans as they are presented their problems as they themselves see them and provided only such temporary

 let 's get tough is one of those movies that people probably regret years later that they made full of awful talk and jokes this east end kids story details how the kids want to join the military to defeat the since they 're too young they decide to clean the town out of those they find one throw fruit at it without anyone doing anything to stop them and he pulls a short out to them the say to

 this film requires a lot of patience because it focuses on mood and character development the plot is very simple and many of the scenes take place on the same set in 's the dennis character apartment but the film builds to a disturbing characters create an atmosphere with sexual tension and psychological it 's very interesting that robert altman directed this considering the style and structure of his other films still the trademark altman audio style is evident here 
 does anyone remember it who also directed and was by the film contains over N errors does anyone remember the green that s the john wayne western where the duke a called vietnam from a bunch of from the tribe if you watch we were soldiers you can help but be reminded of these two films of all what s with that scottish that s played three times in the movie four if you count the end credits i mean 
 note i could n't force myself to actually write up a review of night it just ca n't be done instead i went through what i thought about while watching the that i thought about while watching night 'm so tired of those dreams where these elaborate deaths will take place only for the main character to wake up right before she it of course when i say elaborate deaths i mean off screen or in the did n't the 
 this movie just seemed to lack direction the plot developed so many in such a short amount of time that it seemed to lose any of what the true was there was a lot of wasted dialogue and just seemed like the writing was rushed and a little too the scenes and story began to take a back seat to the character 's back stories which were a little weak to begin with in all i would say it unless 
 rock hudson 's second venture in the science after seconds is embryo a film that combines elements of the of and in one rather weird film about for lack of a better word a test tube baby that grows up to be barbara is scientist in organic development and gets a chance to first experiment on his own when it is hit by his car some from the female dog are given to a born and it grows into an

 the in the dark is william 's favorite episode it is also one of my favorite episodes the program is pure star because it deals with one of the series ' main themes the respect for other life forms i do not think one could get a example of one of the show 's most interesting ideas in this episode kirk and his crew have to a monster that is killing miners on a distant planet the story is an 
 i enjoyed this film very much it effectively combines humor fantasy and a few moments of with a solid film making effort from brilliant and a very original story concerning my only complaints are that it had its moments and was n't as as it could have been still i give this a solid N out of the u.s. should take note of this and other fine japanese films that have come along recently and have them available on region 
 people must learn to watch what is up there on the screen this is a great film that is based on a slow careful gathering of details which serve to establish the of these two men the of the country is well described by his fear of talking to women he has at least three chances to start a conversation with a young woman and loses all of them he has many decades of ahead of him and maybe unemployment 
 my very favorite character in films but in nearly all of them the character of has a small bit of as a and if the s can tell who is under that then they are in reed s s fighting serial N the his whole face making it a real mystery as to who really anyway is one of the best character s in films and to bring it up to date think anthony hopkins in the of N is 
 this movie will be a hit with those that enjoy explicit about sexual and f in almost every sentence like a good plot like comedy like or other human values stay away from it was so bad i left after about half an hour i saw two kids slip in that looked to be about N very harmful this deserves an x 
 ok ok i must say i was impressed it 's hard to say what i 'm more impressed with my ability to choose the right romantic comedy to watch so that i do n't my eyes out or the movie itself either way was pretty good it was good enough for me to watch twice will smith was funny and good kevin james was just and absolutely essential for the movie as much as this movie centered around will smith 
 this is a great movie i like it where down to get his ink and the chase him but he them opened the window and did n't even notice them is very pretty too & when he stuck the up 's its and when he is saying love is the greatest thing on earth while standing between two is great too then also the part where he his while watching guy kill many people then you see him as he 
 my is one hell of a roller ride the special effects were excellent and the wore were is an actress but she proved everyone wrong and her role as the girlfriend she was just simply wilson was also good as the average joe but he was a man to work with one of the greatest of all time the supporting cast was also especially who was extremely good a lot better than in the scary movie franchise did very well 
 this was the worst tv movie i had ever seen the were so it made me i the constant in and out and the frequent black and white to color switch i also thought that the story did n't make any sense what so ever and it was another action movie with a hero a bad guy and a few i could make a better movie than that with my own camera why i can hold it steady something the 
 i had looked forward to this movie it seemed anyone who had seen it loved it i was completely disappointed the acting was so the script seemed like the writer had gathered N different scripts from various movies and chose dialogue and them together to form one was any omitted in this movie there was a hit a serial killer a fire numerous the main character in love with the cross by the police style i could go on and 
 the zone has achieved a certain about it much like star that 's because there are many devoted of the show that no matter what think every episode was a winner they are the ones who score each individual show a N and can not evaluate the show because of this a while back i reviewed all the original star episodes the good and the bad because the overall ratings and reviews were just too positive now it 's time

 back in college i studied marketing and even though i missed a whole lot of classes and never really paid any attention i will always remember the main and most essential principle of marketing namely it 's not what you sell it 's how you sell it this principle fully applies to the 's as it 's basically a and yet empty package richard knew exactly that he had to the 's attention away from the major so he threw 
 having worked with young on the run i found this film surprisingly i would never have found it had a friend not his there are classic themes here coming of age the limited choices of the who is the good tragedy is in every life & the many or relationships are meaningful when alice acquires a gun we know she has some with how to use it and it does not end in the cast really sells their roles it 
 also known as water this film tells the story of two as they struggle their way into the world of love and sex this story is told at a slow pace and that works very well it gives plenty of time and space to get to know the different characters and to grow somewhat attached to a small cast puts some extra pressure on the people playing as they all have some more screen time than normal but the people 
 i loved this movie first because it is a family movie second because it offers a take on dealing with the news of in a family with far less than what i have normally seen in the movies the brothers are very close yet are not their desire to protect the youngest brother is noble but not needed in the end i understand that leo 's choice on how to deal with his treatment may not have been the most 
 a total and of a movie the kind of film even would be embarrassed to script direction acting and action 's are so dire as to be almost painful to watch and one help thinking that it 's mere N minute running time could have been better spent the above must be related to the director as that 's the only reason i can see for of this some might call it fun or bad it 's good ' just 
 i grew up watching the old inspector as a kid it was like get smart for kids ca n't solve any case and all the work is done by the walking talking dog brain and his penny i had heard the live action movie was decent so i it out at the library i this movie for free and felt i should have been paid to see comes nowhere near the of acting don adams had as the voice of 
 there is little more that i would like to say about this movie than it really can touch your heart if you let it sure it 's surrounded by all the hollywood stuff but i found myself actually in this movie and very interested in the outcome i 'd recommend it to all you out there in a second 
 david mackenzie 's to the brilliant young wants to be a story of a who is trying to some issues with his dead mother it wants to be realistic and at the same time it wants to be funny and of its lead as he himself as an meet this end the film tries hard to be its has letters looking like that of its original is of rock which tries to convince the audience that is ok just a 
 what in god 's name happened here how does one go about creating what is practically a cheap of was ever supposed to someone anyone or even make a dollars profit but mainly what happened here extreme was directed by a by the name of andreas who specializes in films such as of and N and some of which contain in the titles in the department this one is n't much different than the rest although the level of well

 i think i 've seen worse films so i 'm giving this a N but it 's a struggle to remember what they could have been possibly nasty & or possibly just plain but it is a struggle to think of something worse it 's difficult to know where to start let 's just say it 's a poor man 's under an even poorer man 's jean van the only feature was seeing van i always what happened to 
 i would be one of the few people who owns a copy of this classic but i only own N i actually own its that when i say good i mean bad but i will try to do a review i even watched a ' which one of the other here mentioned to compare it to this and born a is actually worse but not quite as is this ever funny everything about this movie is poor everything the plot 
 the real irony is this joe was a top in other situations away from the he had a track record for being very funny and and larry and had actually known him or at least of him for many years and liked his work so what on earth was going on when he joined the troop as the third obviously nothing in most of these late era more often than not the boys are against each other or joe against 
 i just got back from the film and i 'm completely this movie is an to all of the theatre i was in maybe had N other people this movie was recommended to me and i could n't believe that this person liked it i ca n't believe that any human would like it there was no plot no plot at all it was a joke how can you make a movie about nothing this movie only goes to show 
 after the success of and spanish movies spread like a disease in the increasingly sad world of movies the result is all in films like el a production bad written but acted and directed even worse i did n't read the campbell book but i 'm sure that the author of the who its mother did n't have much in common with this terrible production avoid it at any cost unless you 're searching for a quiet night in a

 the one of the best films of all times and everybody must realize this a boy and a big fun and in this days our industry is is the best film of last ten maybe one of the best films of all is quite story characters atmosphere is is a director and tells about routine event family dreams expects about you tells about me tells about promise you will find a piece of your body in this life a new 
 i seems in the beginning a interesting film a spanish in a interesting madrid but it none of that is actually a film only interesting for future films directors learning about what not to do making a film it can be worse in others words even the presence of a winner enough to justify the $ dollars to see this film the acting is and it seems the actors were just waiting to finish the daily shots to go home 
 i do n't know why i picked this movie to watch it has a strange title and from the it just looked like something different every once in a while its good to try a film that 's slightly different from the mainstream hollywood and this film certainly was different right from the beginning this film had me but i could n't figure out why until the end if the film when i realized that the movie was great because 
 did it better much of 's speaking part is letters written to various complaining about the amount and speed of his payment 's mostly about the death of children and other family matters is an more engaging the music is century and producing century concert hall sound the overall production quality reminded me of a junior high slide show s was a brilliant man whose music speaks for itself this film adds nothing sent me N that would n't play 
 this movie earns its N for writing poor technical merit and problems some people have given this movie a N and perhaps that is if you are simply scoring it for its fun factor however technically this is an movie serial from start to finish produced by writers actors and crew that really was true of nearly all the because they were meant as entertainment particularly aimed at the kids and there 's nothing wrong with that but high art 
 this story is told and and continues to be in every possibly way imagine the charles 's story has been in every possible way imagine i admit i have not seen the classic sim version and i 'm sure someday i will but i would be away if it touched even close to this amazing version i believe that if himself had created his story for film this would be story is well known i wo n't go into much

 this was a great movie for being only N minutes long there was an aspect of contained in this movie and i am glad that picked to film it in black and white the plot is simple yet entertaining that keeps you engaged even the dialogue was good along with the acting it reminded me of what was to come in by not being in order i liked how the main character tried to use what taught him for example 
 could have been good fun but it the only it is the pace is deadly slow and the plot is fairly confused and so that it 's next to impossible to care where it 's going the story would have been acceptable in a creative writing class from a and sensitive eighth but this video should have carried a warning label caution student film fit for only by of the film maker 
 james bond in the well that 's the way it looks is after all best known as bond in never dies N and golden eye N both shot prior to this release frankly the film 's two leads are both badly with turning in the marginally more convincing performance and with as grey 's love interest having to battle with two on the other hand are perfect but the film is not about it is about the of the canadian 
 this first and hopefully not last & feature lives up to expectations there are plenty of jokes some a bit as well as some great to past science movies with the of awful and movies being forth from hollywood it 's great to see such a great film like this that 's for almost everyone if there is any justice it will be top of the and be at least for best at the next the is wonderful the characters 
 this is going to be my first review on and i 'm glad that the standard rating is N out of N because then i do n't have to change anything first there are awful movies movies you can make a out of like island city earth or the that is totally acceptable they makes a great party then there are the worst movie ever i can not believe how utterly this pile of dog found it on a second 
 this movie was a there was no development of the story viewers were thrown into the story without explanation and left to fend for themselves in trying to work out what was going on the action were but confusing they were n't the and they were n't tiger this movie is best left to cable tv where you do n't have to pay to see it or convincing a friend that they should hire it and then go over and 
 i as eugene morris jerome in my high school of the play and this film definitely does n't live up to the script or the of neil simon i know this play and and i can tell you that the acting was off the production was the changes in the play 's script were poorly done if you want to really enjoy this play you should see the actual play not a hollywood movie the eugene character lacked soul and 
 we were excited to rent this one after reading a few reviews and seeing that it scored so highly here well we got it home and could not believe what we saw its basically comes off as if its written by some hard up old guy who could not help his sexual and into an film that really lacks in plot and humor the main character is all over the place one moment he is like an little kid the 
 this is the film i have ever seen but in all fairness it 's and rather funny i do n't think the intended it to be your typical hollywood blockbuster quality it 's just a stupid film about a serial killer who gets in a load of toxic waste causing a reaction with him and the snow as it 's the middle of winter he then turns into a killer which is enough to to make you on it 's 
 this is n't a very good movie but it is easily the best studios film i have ever viewed lloyd the brains behind is n't concerned with a good plot or even making a moderately entertaining film his chief concern is making something bizarre and his definition of bizarre my definition of terrible this film we have the titled character whose favorite is n't baseball but the heads off of receiving his release from the board has deemed him despite 
 i just watched this short at the movies was a very sweet sad little movie about two brothers that are in love there is some great acting from both the male leads often times movies with this subject matter seem to get too caught up in the controversy and shock value of the plot that they forget that there is an actual story writer director james does not do this and instead lets the story play out with honesty the 
 the slightly set up episode of the previous week paid off in no uncertain terms with an episode that hit the heights there was a certain to the resolution of the but it was a good start for all that as is now common with this doctor the moral ethical and emotional considerations of his actions were stage they were always there in the classic series but they were a side issue to be over when the doctor was in 
 star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning a notably bad actor getting by on his now looks rather than any strong dramatic talent richard has always occupied a rather position in the american hollywood scene always a sure bet in leading man roles who still holds a notable presence today but he seems to have settled more into these sort of direct to release roles and as such maybe seems to be more settled in 
 who would have thought that such an little film could be so and i am really impressed it 's a shame that more people have not seen it i loved as always 's score and what a debut by bernard rose yet i wonder if i should call this a film it could easily be argued that it is a fantasy or a drama as well well regardless i love the potential it has everything and everyone in 's played 
 why would anyone make a film like this why would anybody invest in a film like this why would anybody in the film business work on a film like this why would any theatre show a film like this why would any tv channel program a film like this why would any critic bother to review a film like this why would anybody watch a film like this why would mental not be made of the of a film like 
 mary is definitely much better but this is a lovely film nonetheless is as price and david has great fun as mr. brown their chemistry was just brilliant as well the children however just lacked the same though paul is very funny and the were actually not as bad as some people say beautiful sea is the best in fact all the are outstanding the special effects were wonderful that had plenty of magic and the story is original enough 
 after i saw la several years ago i said to myself that i would never see it again so powerful and disturbing it was time went on but i could not get the movie and its main character out of my mind the story of a respected piano teacher in vienna cool and collected on the surface an expert in classical music with the inner world so dark and disturbing with the of fear and destruction strong enough to her 
 a movie and very gary has never been more and is more beautiful than in any other film if you do n't believe just watch the movie every cast member is wonderful the love scenes between gary and will make your race the story is great the script is do n't miss this film 
 it borrowed scenes from star wars etc the humor is so dry and that you ca n't help but occasionally at its and the fact that you are watching it exactly what you 'd expect from an comedy the average person would enter with an of N and leave with less than stephen is an obvious from this movie the humor would have worked better with stephen the version of this movie is not as good as the original the 
 note that i did not say that it is better just more the lack of social commentary and helps keep things was actually sort of surprised that this was not a movie as it has all the including from the after every murder a ridiculous rape scene which is sort of hard to get upset about since the is a and 's a lot to love a about whom it is that he has no or feet drives a police

 i 've never been impressed by anyway and final justice which i had n't seen prior to its airing proves to be no exception it 's not that the character is any less than mitchell it 's just that there 's less that call me ' to fact one suspects that mitchell and final justice were all schemes of a agent of joe don 's trying to get the star killed by a heart don must have found a new 
 i do n't understand why some of you or many have given this film upward of N stars out of do you understand that there are lower ratings for a reason sure this may be a with some but it i 'm not a on films but this was awful really actually i should call it more like a because how the acting is production is well barely an attempt at plot development awful acting silly effects and an abrupt 
 the gets started ' the formation of the ' without even to develop any of the characters or show us why anyone is doing what they are most of the events in the movie seem to the plot without even a of character development the plot from club scenes to action scenes and back again 
 japanese 's N is extremely trash film and so fun to watch there are also some but i have n't seen them since these films are rare some kind of some day would be nice since i think many trash would like these films the in story is about one extremely strict school in which teachers think that it is to students in order to discipline which is according to the teachers the most important thing in education the school 
 i do n't understand why more people have not on this other than the fact that perhaps not very many have seen it it 's an amazing cast of characters one after another after another all done by the guy who wrote the play if you do n't like plays you may not like this after all plays usually do n't look good on tv but it 's a show that will have you paying attention throughout highly recommended 
 but i want to say i can not agree more with a wonderful was thinking about it just this morning wanting to give advice to some who 'd lost money on his card through fraud and wanted to say money in ' and i was talking like james he did n't say those words i still think he would i 've never forgotten carrying ' in his reconciliation with his son have money in ' good enough kids have with 
 harry has a quote right on the front cover of the the next of really i have heard a lot of surrounding this one but was n't totally convinced however i am a die hard fan and will give just about any movie a chance no matter the budget or the rating cause never know where your find the next not is poorly poorly acted and funny just because you have the actors who played and and a with tons 
 i 've seen better production quality on i the actors as the writing was terrible and the direction not sure how they could get the lines out i really doubt any actor would have been able to salvage this movie no matter how good they were the characters were not developed at all and there was no real in the plot which just seemed to go nowhere much it 's a shame really as the for the movie was good 
 the lifetime channel aired this in october but i only got around to watching it now it 's the old again small-town connecticut boy dave ford long has a quick with his best friend 's girlfriend on the of his departure for law school in new york thinks about her for the next five years while he is n't doing contracts and briefs runs into her again when he returns home after the death of his father on the of 
 of course i was watching i loved i liked season N season N was ok and loved the final one there is a show i did n't know about this at all one of my friends told me about this i was really watched the first N episodes what a piece of girl drama there is no science well hardly any at the end of every episode we can catch a of a that 's all who this did they 
 i saw this when it first came to video my little sister got it as a gift and i was probably N at the time what stood out for me was the lack of conflict that so many movies have where the main characters get mad at each other because when it comes time to explain themselves they just do n't say the one thing that you 're shouting at the screen that would make sense of the whole deal 
 in this movie everything possible was wrong and i do n't know why i bothered watching it until the end it would have been more fun watching dry for out loud i even liked and it was much better than this here is the basic plot for you a gets by that hold the evil of N and becomes an killing machine that have zero during the movie i lost hope when it did n't scare me at all when 
 i 'm seen this in its in a movie theatre and the pictures are one really wonder how by did they manage to film those waves those animals those is that a plant a a from the movie anyway it 's remarkable sure we 've seen a lot of such on tv with weird animals and so on but none with such a beauty a precision a deep the only downside is the commentary in french it 's by usually 
 somehow they up the N 's ten years that changed our country in four hours and what a painful four hours it was they the major events and and they claimed it was about two families yet you barely saw the family if i were nbc i would be and embarrassed for airing such trash what was amusing was this family you saw in the very beginning was in so many ways but managed to attend every major N 's 
 i had first watched this several years ago on a tv channel the film emerged as a from not being sure what i had made of it initially despite having status over the years the achievement proper is clearly viewed with even by i opted not to make the purchase as i did with the similar and to me without a face N recently however i managed to acquire the via a copy of the spanish which over the two 
 david lynch usually makes films that resemble put together the wrong way they are interesting to look at and think about but they really do n't in your mind perhaps art will always mean the most to its straight story is not a typical david lynch film not that there 's anything typical about them anyway it 's an through rural america a real life alvin straight took on a lawn to get to his brothers house he rode N 
 i saw this film last night following a lot of good reviews from many sources i would like to point out that if your not ready to try and work out who is who and what it all means you will hate this am still struggling to understand the roles of the actors in this film the film from different stories and does not allow you to really with any of the the political 's and those interested in corruption 
 when i was growing up into space was my most favorite movie i remember the time when channel N ran the movie for the whole week and me and my watched it every single day i still remember every part of that movie the ending was so sad when giant robot got up along with and then watching with all the running down his face calling for giant robot there should have been a to the movie in which giant 
 in this short an urban man and his wife have their weird lives set when the man takes to wearing an old red suit of his mother in kept watching this hoping that i could see why it had been made or why the other found it funny for me it was a total waste of everyone 's are the same but this was clearly not to mine 
 i actually found this movie ' finally one worth my time to watch and rent it is true some scenes were over the top on shouting etc. but what movie does n't stress its agenda or to ' almost none what surprised me is that i read a review elsewhere done by a on another review site but found his negative review instead a more accurate of his own review of the movie not of the movie at all anyone 
 this is only the second time i 've felt enough to comment at about a film the first time was for probably the best movie i 've ever seen and that was for is at the other end of the scale compared to as in the worst film i 've had the to see apart from the two scenes containing naked women there is nothing in this movie to raise it from the that it 's see effects script bad 
 michael has always claimed that was the only film he did for the money as well as the worst film he ever in hold on michael were n't you in the and hurry and were n't both of those films a good deal worse than perhaps only too the demands of an action film in N degrees temperatures the director richard was as a result of during the shoot what actually emerges as is not the career of michael instead 
 this is a beautiful funny vivid film it 's even better than nuovo which it parallels but does n't the story a full circle and had the theater as the credits rolled a hundred years after this story takes place we 're just as by images in a dark theater 
 man was for the first N minutes but as soon as the so-called special force agents hit the screen it went down hill faster than a fat kid on a opening makes us think we might have a yet fun on our hands but no the film makers any hope of that when the special force agents show up i wish the took a different route and had the man chase down some until one of them finally gets the 
 the idea behind dead is great takes place during an radio talk show there was so much going for this film unfortunately as soon as the made their appearance all was film is ridiculous and only those with a passion for will enjoy it the were stupid they ran around their arms they looked like a bunch of people putting on a house for know this is a brief review but i just do n't see the need to invest 
 i love plain and tall end its such a good movie it tells of the of living on a live on a farm so i know what its like to have love the setting in kansas its such a beautiful place my favorite country star is from kansas i love the country in kansas its just so beautiful i would love to live in plain and tall end i think is a love story i love love stories they are 
 tells us the story about a boy who lost his mother and some sort of complex is something like N minutes long but would be better in ten there 's like an hour in the middle where he is doing climbing practice on and habits in a church tower like only he is much less sympathetic 's a strange love story involved which does n't have anything to do with anything she happens to look like his mother yes so 
 master of italian is called a lot of bad things by and is of absolutely none of the backlash in fact every time i hear something bad about i think they 're really talking about he just does n't get the same amount of attention because his films were never as successful in theaters in fact his best film N 's cemetery man was probably his least successful or just did n't get the attention he felt it because after 
 i guess that after leonard had been successful in the search for and the home william thought he could direct too although he is a competent actor he shows here that he 's just not a good this movie is hard evidence to support the arguments of who say that william being an arrogant for although his character james kirk was always the most important role in the original star it seems in this movie that he is the heart 
 have you ever felt like your being watched like someone keeps on every move you make well just remember before you decide to break the law the fbi will always be there at least that 's the feeling you get after watching the but slightly crime drama the fbi story it the roots of the organization from a small bureau to one of the most modern facilities in the world in N by telling the story through they eyes of 
 i think this would have been a much better film if the had been portrayed in a more light my family is from the southeast region of louisiana and i live in southeast texas about N miles from lake charles i have never heard the people i grew up around talk like these folks did the were portrayed as most of the i know are well educated proud people and do n't sound at all when they talk the way 
 this show has all the typical characters in a comedy the good guy the the the rich girl but it 's set on the N 's that 's the only difference that it has with other tv i do n't know how you can like this show its humor is i mean the jokes are so direct a typical is this oh i want to have sex with you audience you 're a audience oh yes i am audience and 
 this appears to be two movies into one in the first is a in a small town she wants to help the romantic life of ok i 'd never heard of her before either but she and are in both parts of this we know it is no longer miss polly she is i had to to see if i 'd fallen somewhere i had n't she no longer in a small town but on her way to the title 
 this show drives me crazy it goes against everything a family should be even if it is intended to be a comedy the show is to follow dave and gold michael and as they raise their three children larry and mike a good premises for a comedy yes but it does not mean it will be a good do n't think i 've ever heard talk from parents to children and vice the only talk that seems to be in 
 the movie is just as fun as at the is a total that nothing better to do than sit on his fat rear making a smoke ring from his and drinking while the doctor acts like a version of nicholas up all that so called blood which in reality seemed like fruit of all the seemed very to even call this piece of a rest of the characters in this movie are total of time the ending was awful the 
 this show had a lot of but i did n't know about it until the season N someone even recommended the show to me but i decided that if i was going to watch it i was going to wait until the end of the season so i could watch it in bulk due to the show 's format i 'm happy i waited i imagine it would have been fairly have nearly every episode end in the middle of 
 this is the most film ever made in hollywood it is a tale of how to take a european and the life of of it until it is a dry like an on the the because it reveals how the world of hollywood really works money it makes me wonder how many great films could the of my memory if the hollywood process had not them to cry for the murdered children see or read the golden egg if you 
 is a film that has all the elements of a class a western except one the story that really belongs to a class b or c. that was acceptable at the time the film was made when people were so to see a western in color but it just looks very nonetheless for people who enjoy old it is entertaining the original color and sound are very well kept on the that recently came out is a good is mean 
 i saw this australian film about N years ago and have never forgotten it the movie shows the of war in a way that hollywood usually over the relationship between the soldiers of the two countries is by the differences in culture and the ultimate knowledge that in the end we are all really not different on the inside if you can find any type of copy of this buy or rent it you wo n't be disappointed just 
 i have not watched every episode it was mildly entertaining if nothing else was going but after watching # N i was of and dunn they had a nice attitude in the movie so i figured i 'd tune in on la boy was i seriously you could pair a bunch of provide them with the same budget and i bet they could knock off something more creative on the screen i mean at N where most people are in 
 this is the worst movie of all time it 's one of those that is so ridiculous and the acting so bad that you turn off the video into it so that you can use your time for better purposes like cleaning the toilet if you actually watch the whole thing god help you 
 if you feel as the singer is too much of a pain to watch on tv try watching him in the movie for N hours straight his face is all throughout the movie and it is very to see him act the demanding and intense scenes this is way far from a real love story get the right it is not or and is complete with him doing a dance auto fight scenes getting accused of murder he from prison 
 it 's now N and years since this first aired i have n't actually watched it seriously or closely in about N years now that i 'm an adult in my i can look back with a serious eye as i watch the episodes concept the is partly an to the classic but also its own original show there are a few episodes that are structured like the old for example there is a singer that attacks and so he 
 neither the total disaster the critics claimed nor the its few insist is at the very least an attempt by guy to add a little substance to his but then nothing is more than an ambitious film that off more than it can especially one using the movie as might be expected from 's name on the credits as producer there 's a element of de look ' about it set in a kind of realistic fantasy world where america 
 former pack actor and all round pretty boy lowe stars in a film set in a high security american prison i had a gut feeling his character was going to be popular for all the wrong reasons like in the first series of but that kind of film it s more like a man on the run film like the it also makes a to the themes of punishment and justice with james putting in a as the spokesman for 
 i do n't know why the critics this movie i hardly ever agree with them movie could have been a little i do n't usually go to movies i even had to myself up to see it in the i need n't have bothered the was full of kids too was great as always i also liked zeta jones and taylor the house was very and beautiful in a way the special and sound effects were i also loved the 
 miss cast away is an amusing which with serious plot or character development to pack in as many as possible best enjoyed with a large audience that is open to such and perhaps has had a few drinks most of the jokes are based so in future years this film may become a of pop culture to conversion of the does create a appearance in some parts most the opening appearance of jackson is indeed a strange event but i 
 this movie over does it on the i mean really they over did it the original is better it does not use like the in this movie its the simple people running from killer and really in afghanistan the plot involves army soldiers finding a terrorist and being attack by and dying _ but the reason i gave this movie N stars is because the way the camera in on the soldiers the acting is bad and this does n't 
 please people do not bother with this poorly directed joke the direction was totally wrong from the outset where is the history of his mothers ' emotional and the general in the original family why is ed portrayed as this large imposing figure full of anger and hate what is this the writer and director obviously did no research into the history and just wanted to cash in on the name the who made this movie took so many with 
 ken russell directed this weird not very and if i had n't known that i would have my life that the director was brian absolutely everything about crimes of passion from the that is a little too to the domestic that turns into a and slash plot to even the title this unfortunately since brian is increasingly seen as a poor over the years russell should have tried a style of his own sure an in the style of or 
 there is the of film and there is the frustration of movies made on the cheap this one falls into the second spot is the name of a the film is about a whose father has been killed by he heads out to track them it was the bad print maybe it 's me but i felt i 'd seen this a hundred times most of those times better than it is has promise too the is with a woman 
 after tracking it down for half a year i finally found a copy and it was not disappointing because i 'm one of those die hard fans who need to see all their works and i finally got to see the so called hot film of but i could n't believe was forced to make a movie as such in his respectable now i 'm sure he that he made this movie nevertheless they found the perfect person for looking 
 this is one of those movies that make better than feature films the concept was really cool and different the humor was unique i just felt there were missed opportunities to put the into this movie so many lines and were left hanging too long with no ending and really did n't leave me laughing wilson wilson & were great was in this film and needed more exposure and more opportunities to spin her character into more screen time N 
 this was perhaps the worst movie i 've seen in a long long time forget that it 's clear no research was done regarding detroit forest in downtown detroit the writing was horrible the completely and quite frankly the characters were embarrassing i can not for the life of me understand why actors would to such a low and participate in something this god awful now i have never seen the original and do n't know if this movie pays 
 below but read on or you 'll never know the horrible fate that all to rent a night in a research laboratory a major medical is about to have deadly results a chemical compound that was created to hunt and destroy deadly cancer cells has from the hazardous waste disposal system into the building 's now the involved in the laboratory experiment are not the only in the facility that will become the altered professor a leading has just determined

 the idea for the movie was n't too bad a film shot in a corn on halloween the bad part was the camera work the ten million shots of and corn and the hour and a half long walk this guy took in the oh i 'm sorry the i picked up this movie because it reminded me of a corn near where i live and i thought it was a cool idea for a movie but taking everything into 
 this movie was by far the worst movie that i have ever seen in my entire life i 'm not even it was poorly made and the actors could n't act it was a waste of my time and money it looked like a movie that my friends and i could have put together on our own the case the movie came in is definitely a nothing in the movie looks like the on the front of the case it 
 i 'm from i 'll try to speak in english all i want to say about this movie is that it is and will be my all time number one seen it above N times at least and will see it for many years now it has all the little things i like in a movie it 's very makes me cry shows a whole lot of love things and questions about love and reality and the true things that 
 this usually all sounds a lot better in my head so me for i 'm hardly 's biggest fan and will try not to to calling him a ' which is quite hard i do n't like to or a movie before seeing it so with cautious i walked to the today to watch to call it a of a ' would be unfair here is happy enough to take the title from 's less than spectacular dozen but not 
 strange and if striking a fantasy really boring way too much male including incest and just a sort of i will however that certain of dialogue taken on their own terms do have a quality 
 i 've seen many hoffman 's movies like dogs or rain man and i liked them but his characters are much to often calm or even shy persons i expected him to be in this movie the same as he was in dogs but i saw a totally different person he was much more energetic in this film and reminded me of al in the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end i liked the way hoffman 's 
 i watched this movie on television back in N and it was an amazing movie i would love to track down a copy of it just to watch it again and again it 's been N years since i watched it and it still out in my mind from the beginning it draws you in the characters and plot line keep holding you the ending was the feeling and rage that the son displayed when finding out the truth about 
 it is so rare that i get to rate a movie without having some as to whether i should have gone up one or down one but this one did the explosion rate a higher or one down because my brain hurt trying to create a plot no this one a solid no 
 no movie with in its cast could possibly be that said i have to add that this british film comes close the story takes place on board the atlantic ' and it 's based on the 's ' the word ' is spoken the strikes an and we hear a my god to ' the doomed passengers eventually take over the in a bit of sound work but the year of the film 's release N means that a modern 
 i have seen bad films but this took the made no sense and all the characters do is every couple of seconds oh and i think one has a low count its that good a plays a a english plays a of a and some lesser lights play there are some russian oh yes some one has a gun and maybe talks high on this film like the 
 robert they call his character doctor i think he 's a or something and family move to an affluent suburb and his dog are nearly killed when some local neighbor kids get drunk and go through his front yard at he charges which the kids ' and suddenly him and his family are the victims of a violent and disturbing mason rather plays his wife who urges him not to use violence against his and who really just wants to 
 a large part of the scenes should be cut off there is a lot of scenes that should have been cut off for example the scene where the i got on my dick i like dick playing in the scene or a bar scene where a professional main job is a about other scenes featuring a woman who wants to loose her to a who walks like he wears women 's three too small while they make love did n't 
 the channel plays nothing but soft each night from till about N in the morning but their ' factor is very limited if one exists at all in fact i am sure i will find a pound win more scary than anything this channel has to leads the dance deserves special mention because it is i feel the low of a channel full of lows i can not even begin to tell you how bad this film is but for 
 water shows the plight of indian in the late says in the end that the problem still exists largely by giving statistics in the end to gandhi several times in the movie before finally having a scene him and does nothing extra ordinarily innovative or new in the movie yes the is pretty impressive but that can not be the soul of any movie for me india has had several problems like many other nations but it has got rid

 if you and your friends find as much humor and from horrible acting jokes and overall film making as me and my friends you need to rent simply reading the tag line and seeing how not funny it is you should assume more not funny poor quality great content through out its a tale of some of kids who every law of physics and reality and fly back in time through a modern day big screen tv to a world 
 normally i have no problem with a movie or story with an ending that leaves you wondering to out what really happened when it 's done on purpose but this movie really feels like they got all but the last N minutes done then realized they had $ N left to finish on i saw it on i recommend you not spend money on it either if you catch it on tv watch all but the last N minutes then 
 i really this movie mainly because of the main characters they are both and people they hurt everybody around them playing their silly game the effects were good but what good are they if there are no characters that you with or a story line that is interesting am i supposed to be happy when these two people finally their love for each other after watching this movie i was thinking this is supposed be the # N from france 
 this film the word it will surprise most that this word can actually be found in the defined as nonsense the movie the word because i would have to add to those four words pc on a level and film tries so hard to be and in touch with contemporary and thinking do they think there is almost no plot to speak of though there is one to sleep to the and most things about it are how a white 
 this movie makes look like 's list and the really need to consider more carefully before putting their names on a product a like this regardless of the involved is just bad business larry needs to be kept away from a movie camera at all costs shows that his skills are inadequate for any of those jobs a project gone south hell ride allows usually good actors to the at least when the camera is n't centered on 's attempts

 from what i remember seeing of this film it was not good i always say that if a film is good and can keep you attention throughout the hardest of moments example a cold & war than it is a film that has done its job the fact that i was for most of this film only proves the fact that it could not keep my attention and it did not complete its job why did i fall victim to 
 this movie lacks any or even mild even the is not good the plot would have some promise if it was done by someone who about what they 're but the people who made this movie obviously did not basically the film proceeds in a series of fits and starts main character insists she 's not crazy about in his yellow or in front of a car on his character insists she 's not crazy and on about her passion

 this is the movie i have ever seen however i have harder at plenty of movies this is because best in show 's lies not in or but in sophisticated and the dialogue is is so quick that you end up laughing not at each individual joke but only until after several jokes build on one another each your until the jokes and you ca n't help letting 's a film but what makes it extraordinary is the acting i 
 there was you is one of the worst films we 've ever seen it fails in every respect was better as an actress in in comparison this film is when a character once or even twice in the course of a film one can understand it but 's character falls trips so often that she might have a bit of jerry lewis in her in her each fall was probably blocked and and although this is bad enough for a

 essentially this is a film with a few features that may or may not redeem it for you depending on how much you want them to in opening up the red green show for the big screen the the carefully over a decade 's worth of episodes set in and around in favor of a road movie with a big musical score and boring that 's not with enough good to make it as entertaining as even the most episode

 i have spent the last week watching john films starting with ' a woman under the influence ' and ending on night ' i am completely and utterly away in particular by these two films from the first minute to the last in night ' i was completely and utterly absorbed i 've only experienced it on a few occasions but the feeling that this film was perfect lasted from about two in right through till the credits came up 
 this film is about a bunch of who are supposed to be assigned to a task that is expected to fail the pull together to successfully complete their the police academy films the humor comes from the characters on the boat i thought it was an engaging film and i will stop to watch it anytime it is on tv no it wo n't cause you to your relative role in the or you to do great things for the 
 this movie was produced by the biggest producer in costa rica although their authors about it as a the biggest movie in costa rica ever made and their actors even to say that they did n't get an nomination due to it 's political with oil he right well this is all a lie this movie was supposedly based on a book written by carlos about a love soap subject and it secondary story is about an oil problem on

 when the magic of opened at radio city music hall i was enough to believe it would be as as some of the first films were story was the by the sherman brothers were way below their usual level the characters were and james stewart and had both seen much better too i was interested in seeing what alice 's contribution would be like since she 'd been from the screen for so many years and was always so in 
 i like underground films when they have something to say or show for that matter i tried hard to like trash i tried to see some artistic achievement or some interesting representation of new york city life in the early N 's or at least being by it but the movie and ca n't be called either art or entertainment trash is basically an excuse to joe 's body for N hours while he meets other figures i agree that 
 i 'd heard about this movie but did n't see it until my daughter who saw it on a flight to australia told me it was a great movie i was interested in seeing whether rupert away from harry was showing the promise you see in the movies i was n't disappointed he 's become a fine actor showing a range in driving from a shy boy being beaten down by an mother to a young man finding himself to

 i believe that this movie was a terrible waste of my time and i would know after watching it N times in class this movie does not show what absolutely perfectly happened during these times no one can truly say that these things happened to the letter if anything the only good part would be the actors even that they were really really were reading the script without expression quite boring i would rather watch play school so i would 
 i would think that this was one of those films whose director had n't read the book it was based on were it not for the fact that they are just slightly similar it is certainly possible for a great film to be based very on a book and this was certainly the latter but not the were a number of flaws one was that it tried to be too much like the railway children probably because adults would expect 
 my wife and i watched this movie because we plan to visit and soon fortunately or unfortunately the landscape and complete with are the only members of this cast we expected reasonable and movie but were disappointed its only grace is an extended and remarkable fishing full of wooden with long and if movie 's is its dialogue and the acting ranges from stiff to completely one scene in which out as her native and husband his on an innocent 
 so steve you have to a man who is not only willing to throw himself into a river that clearly is filled with tons of from the and not only daily but with enthusiasm he was never able to make me want to do it but he managed to make his wife come movie does not fall into my parallel universe of film category the films for people who just had their teeth have a or have no film experience 
 i got the very cheap and i 'm a total and probably the only where this movie could ever interest early drew movie she 's looking great and she gets a quite lot of really scenes of her like a scene a dance scene quite a number of etc she does never show the friendly we know from her more recent movie itself is pretty average or and much more looking like being made for the tv than one for 
 you may like tim burton 's but not in a show off lasting N minutes it demonstrates good technical points without real creativity or some established pace 
 who were they with this there was just too much in this film that was hard to digest right from when wishes death on his father to when he in london with his uncle played by only to abandon him minutes later the only problem with that theory is that anybody who has ever passed through london knows that such a would be impossible to pull off and especially not by an indian but the film problems do not end 
 i have read all of shakespeare 's plays seen productions of a majority of them and even acted in and directed some i do not necessarily believe that shakespeare must be done in the traditional fashion but i this is that is and unnecessary there is that is far beyond what i believe shakespeare intended some of the dialogue is and there are those elements like the and that add no meaning to the movie but replace shakespeare with the 
 this series has its ups and and the latter is the case here there 's an amount of with an of the baby 's weapons but the film is a seriously the itself than usual at times the action to a as the camera follows the of the who nearly gets lost early on all in all said there 's a eastern quality to the music and action that may win the approval of dedicated viewers this installment spends much 
 after reading all of the reviews about this film and a few that give it a i finally decided to throw in my no cents worth i agree with most on the point that if it had n't been for lewis and chris ferry it would have been a disaster in oh just north of where all the real talent fled south down years ago at least as far as a tank of gas would allow i did get a 
 james stewart plays dr. ben who with his wife and son are tourists in an city they get caught up in the middle of a murder scene the victim something in dr.

 grand as it is kenneth 's of what is perhaps william shakespeare 's most popular tragedy under the weight of its four hour playing time and certainly takes some real staying power two entirely separate would most likely be better in order to fully appreciate what is certainly high class film making while i absolutely acknowledge this as such i must to a lack of enthusiasm for the old his rhetoric and he sends himself up so well and his 
 never before has a film driven me to write a review but this was just stuck with it trying to find what it was about this film that made pick it as his first serious role but frankly it was a poor this made a good book but it certainly did not work for me as a found it lacking atmosphere and i found many of the scenes musical he may be but a serious actor acting by and rose 
 law gives his all in this which offers little else of value completely lacking in excitement or leading with appeal one decent fight a few moments of mild and a movie in a series of conversations between law 's character and a dogged well played by timothy but despite their best efforts both actors are to the cross of the film 's a lesser actor in the lead role and without the benefit of oliver 's would into the sea

 i 'm a fan of low budget and but this was too much even for you can get past the weak plot the effects and the acting then the horrible writing will kill you or you 'll wish it would the was most likely written by high school who thought that saying sir yes sir over and over again made these guys sound more characters were all the typical other guy with sensitive side evil scientist with secret agenda or

 this is a little movie that provides pretty much what it promises some good entertainment after all when a movie it features top you have to figure that it is not a likely candidate for the best picture those guys are not actors your next clue is that the movie does n't star nicholas or you should n't expect to see the current hottest names it was meant to be just plain old entertainment and in that regard it is 
 forest 's performance is all the more impressive for making it almost to sit through this historical does not justify changing history the begins from the ground up with the lead character played by james to create a for the purpose of giving the reader a point of connection in the book is that white people ca n't just read a book without a white to to but at least he was placed in a somewhat passive role making up 
 rich in love is a film which takes the into the on of a somewhat charleston family highly shot well written and acted over you like a summer as its life into the characters such that at film 's end you 'll feel like an old friend of the film from the director of driving miss is a somewhat little which will appeal most to mature audiences 
 reviewing and saying it 's a bad movie is n't hard at all after all critics at the time it came out fell all over themselves this film saying it was among the worst films of the decade so the fact that i say it 's bad or anyone else says it 's bad is certainly no surprise it 's like someone talking about practically no one says that was a good thing right the question i have and no 
 this was a great movie and safe for the entire family which one does n't see much of anymore my wife and i and N son loved it even though you had an of how it would end it continued to be a fun and the final ending surprised us there should be more movies like this 
 several years ago i saw this film without on television and despite me not understanding a word of what the characters were saying i still got the general idea and the mood of the film me no long last i saw it again a few weeks ago my heart when i saw the picture in the television guide and for N days until the film was really shown i told everybody i knew to go and see it the story 
 this movie is available as a special bonus feature on the of N & N it has nothing to do with those movies except it does show that and are in a like those other movies this one features young people who go to a building where they get trapped inside and run down the a lot while they get picked off one by one in the end one or more characters are revealed to have another identity this is 
 i at first thought this little fantasy would be a little entertaining i was wrong a good cast roy as the president did n't help it any the story had every possible scenario that could take place in a terrorist nuclear disaster and none of it could possibly happen true the of the president could only be accomplished with the inside help of a in the secret service air force one but everything they regarding the football and the of 
 given the mgm treatment kate plays a who comes to suspect her rich husband robert taylor is not the she married but a killer mgm 's attempt at a is doomed from the start by a script and the casting of as a woman for her life who could ever imagine afraid of anything louis b. mayer to tell vincent he was a not a musical taylor is embarrassing only robert also as a good guy retains his dignity in 
 i had n't planned on watching because i did n't like that much i thought was a nice but slightly boring little bank movie with a of stars anyway i was talked into watching one night and i it a lot the plot is not only boring but also i do n't even know what it was all about i left the movie after N quarters and got some coffee with another girl who did n't like it much more 
 i 've known about page for many a year now the images of her from the N 's have since become and still have a strong draw even today the page look is also still popular within the world and remains as distinctive today as it did then so i watched this film with quite a bit of to begin with the result did not other things it was entertaining to see the movie 's recreation of actual figures like 
 it is a great tragedy that both richard harris and john are no longer with us but that should n't blind anybody to the fact that in N a pretty appears on both men 's no doubt john this movie doing for his wife what like it hot ' and million years ' did for and respectively creating an sex symbol for the new decade having run to moore on the beach in ' 's reputation an cast and location 
 a good film and one i 'll watch a number of times rich the previous is right there is much more going on here than is clear from the title boards and i have to wonder how much has suffered in translation were there more in the original or was a audience expected to more or since the was written by the author of the novel on which this was based was this a currently popular story with which the 
 just by reading the title you would think that it would be a good movie well at least i did it started out good but became so boring after the first half hour it tells a story about a mother that is so desperate for her daughter to become a that she will go to any to get what she wants the only problem is that her daughter 's friend is the girl in the way she always wins the 
 just went on and finally watched this short directed by richard i had previously watched his funny getting started there in this one a couple are playing the wife keeps shaking her eyes while her husband has nothing but e 's on his side the wife leaves for a while to vacuum her bed and before catching her husband looking at her side briefly before this the husband a tv show called for with the stars something and the husband 
 found this film in a discount for $ N it was n't worth it some of the camera work and look and sound as if it were done by a film student 's performance was somewhat credible but the film was predictable and the action was and thing that i will give them however unlike most action films people in this film actually ran out of and dead bodies for new weapons and 
 i was one of the few who showed up to see steve 's video it was quite an experience in propaganda and was hoping the film might be an actual of michael moore 's visit to my local school but it turned out to be another liberal effort to conservatives and the local community it sure seems for a to make a that only reflects his on 's more surprising is to see all the ' votes his have posted 
 life is too short to waste on two hours of hollywood nonsense like this unless you 're a N year old girl with no sense of reality and nothing better to do characters poor acting weak story slow pace and most important to this films flawed one about the overly dramatic relationship 
 i have always been by silent films there is something about seeing actors and from N years ago performing by today 's high-tech special effects i always try and imagine what it was like to watch a particular film at the time of it 's original release it helps to appreciate the of early the life and passion of is a very production from originally in N but expanded and finally released in imagine a series of famous paintings coming 
 this film is along with and both films leave a lot to be in the way of their prints first both films are very dark occasionally making it hard to see exactly what 's happening second neither film has and you are forced to watch a dubbed film though del does seem to have a better personally i always prefer but for the out there this is n't a problem these problems however are not the fault of the original 
 the plot of this movie is as as a bag of hair plays a character that could have been upset by the of the story he is evil and a wife it 's a character as far from his and la law roles as you could possibly you 've thought he had the looks and the acting to play the really bad boy role her 's your mary louis parker wears black and little black throughout the has always had 
 by mistake i ordered a series from the their new version of robin very disappointing in comparison with terrible and backgrounds while i enjoyed the who took from the grace character the rest of the cast left much to be as a for instance 's looked like it came from and sir guy well he looked a bit like a character from an outer space movie has stolen the probably forever in the telling of this tale cast story lines 
 i watched this episode with high hopes after seeing it on so many people 's episodes list i 'm not in any way but from the start i they were in some sort of with the huge eye looking down on them to the type of characters in there even though throughout the episode the questions of who are we where are we what 's outside carry the of the episode which i unfortunately already figured out i must say 
 first of all i 'd like to tell you that i 'm into and such stuff it is true that everyone has his own preferences but you can trust me on this movie i 'll be objective to begin with the story it 's follows the story line of the comic books as far as i 'm familiar with them but the well it 's not actually terrible but it 's definitely cheap and it would be a lot better 
 look i loved the proper film but this was bad the kind of bad that makes you wish you could get that time back in your life the kind of bad that makes you think what on earth were they thinking to film this in the first place the kind of bad that makes you wish you 'd taken N more minutes when stepping into the kitchen to grab a during the film the kind of bad that makes look 
 my partner and i had never heard of this movie and decided to give it a shot picking the title from a list of movies on cable without knowing a single thing about it as it opened and revealed the cast we thought well how bad can it be bates jonathan rupert lynn dan and more as the story we became more and more with our selection and the film soon had us laughing out loud throughout this is not 
 a strong pilot this episode does an excellent job of setting up the characters and background for enterprise the to the original star series it a few times into convention and space never seem to go out of style and i can already to as seven of but the looks strong the characters are and one can already see hints that this particular crew will have to be more in different ways than those of earlier later series scott hits 
 making a book into a movie by following the story is never a good idea when people read the book they automatically start making their own mental movie of who the characters look like the places they exist in how the situations progress and everybody 's is different which is why when the ' movie finally comes out you 're always going to have a segment of the audience who are disappointed that it just does n't measure a and 
 mr. and mrs. smith is one of the not too well known early american 's movie but if unfortunately also belongs to this category is an not all the movies signed by the master of in that time the early N 's are really worth seeing and to tell the truth not this film is n't really a and mrs. smith is an average and conventional comedy where it 's rather hard to find the 's touch maybe you can 
 this royal basically had the message of these days and image are more popular then edge pretty good match a lot of heat for edge who was just starting out as a again and what better way to go into a match with it kind of got a little slower at the end then usual overall this match gets a not a good match had to carry through this match who seemed to be really lost and up his moves 
 how this character ever got hired by the post office is far beyond me the test that postal workers take is so difficult there is no way that a guy this stupid can work at the post office everyone in this movie is just stupid and that is probably the point of the movie how they could go their entire lives and not see an is also i did n't take this movie too seriously but it was so stupid 
 grant is one of the best directors doing adult films his only rival is andrew is all the movie but the 's office with her & two other is just incredible nearly as good is asia 's performance with the construction worker i highly recommend this movie & gave it a it 's almost as good as grant 's elements of desire which i gave a N 
 it is not every film 's job to stimulate you i will take an ambitious failure over a mass-market hit any day while this really ca n't be described as a failure the sum of its parts remains that quality me into watching it again and again this is a challenging movie that does not wrap things up neatly the problem with the movie is in its structure its plot seems to be up just as a second ending is 
 from actor and independent john a woman under the influence gives the a look at a working class family with a problem of mental the husband played by peter is a blue collar worker who has trouble showing his wife played by the amount of attention that she deserves from the of the film it is obvious that is very and strange but only a few minutes later it is clear that she is much more than that crazy out 
 aged female scientist fellow scientist in order to steal for cells and the aging process she takes it and turns into the beautiful evil who goes around and wealthy very in clothes and those around her looking a lot like the late from the film however in spite of all this it 's and sloppy without the james bond that had had even the madrid and lake geneva locations do n't make up for is by manuel & and it 
 when good times in N it was one the first black family it centered on the poor chicago-based evans family and their struggles to make ends most of the early episodes focused on the parents james and florida evans and their struggle to provide for the family john and were the best part of the show they were actors and had great chemistry as james and florida evans they had three kids and michael was the but son who made 
 the original road house is by no means an award winning film but it is one of the great guilty of all time it should n't have been that hard to make a there 's no need for a big budget big name stars and spectacular effects even the story did n't have to be original all it needed was a good time and some great fights i do n't mean just some well lots of them there are a 
 i doubt this will ever even be a film i loved to be sure and i did not expect much out of this film and got even less what could have been and moving was it was of the music that made and had more than cheap dog food there was no background on or the people of that era the characters shown were not familiar to me even as a fan of 's and all the versions of his 
 i attended the premier last night the movie started out with a bang perhaps due to excitement the audience for about N minutes then most of us spent the rest of the time fighting off sleep this movie can not be compared to or any of guest 's work unless you want to say of is a gone wrong it just fell flat it died it was painful the story went nowhere the jokes were even if you were a 
 one night at 's is a very funny movie that is more than what it should be its form is more sophisticated than what i expected and its was the thoughts behind the movie stupid men are are that 's what i have to say about this movie is that not only does it hate women but it men it does n't have any for any of the men really it seems that way because of the form but the 
 i almost never comment on movies but i saw the N reviews of this movie and decided i had to weigh in with my own review an of mine received this film in the mail mixed in with his academy the guys who vote on the and was so with how constructed this movie was that he brought it in to our class to demonstrate to us how not to put together a film has no plot the scenes are 
 well was morgan freeman any more unusual as god than george burns this film sure was better than that oh god i was totally and all the way through was perfect as the out of sorts and carried off her part as the frustrated girlfriend in her usual well played performance i for one do n't consider her to be either or i think my favorite scene was when opened up the file cabinet thinking it could never hold his 
 this was unusual a film which was in fact it was so nice it on being too hard to believe in parts as i watching this story i was thinking nobody is this nice this mainly i was referring to ed harris ' role as coach jones i think they went a little on his character but that 's better than the reverse showing him worse than what he was in real life odd to see harris playing the role 
 sue is a N year old with an of hair and a life as a she and her father bill jim try to survive on the streets by being small time con artists in chicago bill decides to jump in front of a car in a parking garage while will about lawsuits and to the intended victim it happens to be a very upscale lawyer named grey kelly lynch who is at what she has done not only do the 
 lord david wrote an interesting book in the early where he looked at the works of mrs. charlotte and he selected these writers as the popular of the first half of the period and he explained their strengths and weaknesses as he saw them to the reading public some of his comments are quite relevant to this day but like all criticism it gives an idea of the spirit of the times of the critic 's life as thought highly 
 in today 's world of digital fabrication there is no computer than can replace the actor and writer this type of character driven film is far too rare these days 's performance as well as james jones are to their audience 's high expectations i wonder if this movie was made for tv it has a personal quality to the it is an to say that the performances are all outstanding the only thing that keeps it from being a 
 the movie opens with a beautiful lady in a white running through a eastern european town we know she 's being followed by something because she keeps looking behind her and soon we see she 's being by a man in a black then we realize that the man is actually the hunter and he is after her but look is that her reflection in the store window no its just her identical but unfortunately they both get this brilliant 
 i have nothing against a but this stephen nonsense is too too bright and modern the plot about a new boy in a small town who is a sort of a cross between a and a and who feeds on the blood of female for a more treatment this is given an look and feel with hardly any atmosphere the kids are predictably pretty and energetic but the big plus is alice as the boy 's mother from ghost story 
 think ' with instead of and you get the general idea for this picture a very story with effects and an ending to let the door open for a part let 's hope someone has the sense to spend their money i 'd suggest a the movie ' because compared to this ' kicked and i only watched that show to please my girlfriend wait and watch it on on a sunday when you 've got nothing better to do 
 killer N out of worst acting ever no really worst acting ever david hess last house on the left no the one from the rent it it 's really good is the worst of the bunch pretty stiff competition but he is one would be hard pressed to find a home movie participant with such an camera presence the film actually to a stunning painful halt when he is on the that the film actually has any for mr. hess 
 i was very excited to see a on one of my favorite italian directors has in everything from to he has touched upon a couple of times with films like and & the last this is a and guide to the films of he is interviewed throughout with english rolling across the bottom of the screen the from his films are by a with english the proved extra interesting when it the often in america here the scenes in detail 
 i heard about lost from a that had obvious differences of opinion on entertainment he loved it well i watched an episode or N in the early seasons and was so i it out after a few years i upon lost with the current fare was i surprised can you say well damn i got in the pace and are very good some of the are so so with the characters but over all good my favorite characters are ben 
 the best part in this movie is the first one located in i shows a good talent for photography and the movie start is surprising the rest of the story is quite boring insists on situations and characters trying to suggestions and technique and a very and completely leading the whole thing an end which gives you the of an long story cut abruptly short frankly this is a real movie and is a real director 
 you were on your way up and you on a says to jim leonard that sums up the plot of this story of up and coming leonard a young bogart when his dream gets by the carol played by leonard has been working on a new and improved motor but now his love life and motor company both have their ups and in this N minute bogart had n't developed the quiet style yet good performances by most of the 
 i loved this film i 'm a true tom fan and i have always been impressed with all of his work from his most dramatic roles like cast away the green mile saving private N & philadelphia to his roles like a league of their own turner and catch me if you can the lady big & of course toy story but in this film is n't the only great actor who lights up the screen tyler an up and 
 this movie is like real life by which i mean not a lot happens in the available N hours or so and not much game plan or plot is by the frequently cast their being due to the experimental lighting as mentioned by many a big no big surprise that altman this he is a very performer yes we all loved park but a porter anyone kansas city t. and the women but the fact that the raw material is 
 best stephen king film alongside it though this one is more fun than scary this one 's got it all great cast with a alice and brian and a fun from king himself in an amusing use of music & 's in particular characters in a typical king setting middle of nowhere village of humor you ca n't really get good here because it 's too much fun and over the top but really nice makeup effects like they do 
 following their daughter 's murder and allen escape the city to find and in a on a 's intentions are good he wants his wife to get out of her depression by her across an ancient prison and sees the perfect setting for her when the photos are developed they are full of dead allen quickly the history of in their new mountain dark remains is a pretty decent offers some genuine and plenty of acting is fairly good and 
 this movie starts out with kids telling each other urban such as the in the microwave and getting something extra at a chicken place unfortunately it then turns to your basic movie the first being about a with a bit of a secret this one is at best then it gets worse as the next story about this kid with dead flies is on and it goes on and on and on it is way to long and not all 
 i just watched this movie and i 've got say that with such a great and great talent this turkey just there a friend lent me this movie and i watched with an open mind mainly because he had such high for the story well the movie started off with kevin as a fighter pilot retiring why why did they make him a fighter pilot he was supposedly going to be hired by anthony 's character to be his new 
 this film is my favorite comedy of all time and i have seen a lot of of all i should not this film had no a dialogue is almost completely written by the makes this film absolutely cast is one of the best 's you will ever story is about the dog show in philadelphia and some of the in and is absolutely great this is one of those films that most of the laughing comes from the of the 
 this show was bad the writing the the guy who played craig could n't act his way out of a paper being it was on thursday night this was definitely great to watch with some beers cool music bad acting poor writing all came together for my was a comedy i do n't care what happened to any of the characters they were all boring and stupid the first five episodes were the worst since they could n't reveal who 
 the success of the original french series i 've only watched the first which was n't too bad considering led to a spate of the italian counterpart which even changed the race of its was clearly less and more more and more into as the series went along there were N black films in total with the even having the of her name changed to avoid copyright issues still the object of desire became almost as much of an as 
 five fingers of death is a classic of N 's as the film that broke out to the west this is a must see for any serious fan of the it 's also a damn entertaining film with action solid and mostly fight and great N 's era oh i see so you want it the hard way five fingers is an tale and i mean literally eye for an eye it 's great to see portraying a hero he 
 and give an outstanding performance in this movie along with although it is at first thought to be only about love it really goes down deeper than that the beauty of nature this movie placing among one of the best i have ever seen the horse scenes are absolutely any out there will love this movie 
 man oh man i 've been not the right term there 's a long list to watch this film and finally had the chance to do so and news are for any von 's both element of crime in the dark the five etc is probably the for its in terms everything is and you really get the feeling of being inside this time taking from the masters of like till films of the N 's with drops of von 
 it was like someone was trying to make a scary video game and a at the same time the historical aspect was great everything else was horrible the for the directors other movie that seemed to happen every other minute the video of the actual ghost hunting was like a scary movie rather than an investigation they had house music and sound effects that would you from what was happening thanks for wasted N hours of my time when there 
 huge and summary of american as seen through the eyes of martin to say there is never a moment in all of its N hour running time many periods and directors are all examined discussed more from the perspective of rather than contemporary director for anyone even interested in american films or in general a and the best of the 's century of series 
 full house was and still is a great show it 's a good show for people of all ages and is also a good family show there really are n't any shows like it anymore the kids are very and even though it 's a bit it 's still good especially for anyone who watched it when they were a kid i would love to see the cast interviewed now anyone that would like to see interviews of the cast 
 i wo n't say anything about music because this topic can be so deep that it can become one huge separate review so let 's concentrate on movie that is brilliant no doubt one of the best works of simple story about love friendship freedom and oh yes the for which even are ready to go in war there is not a single fake word single fake character single fake feeling in the story because the love freedom and friendship 
 i was one chosen to see this movie in a you should know that this film is based on the video game far cry a for its time really good game N second you should know that the of this is the great this is a man who takes video games postal etc and makes movies out of them very horrible ones still remember when i saw 's the king 's a there were so horrible mistakes in this film 
 much can usually be in period pieces that ask us to recall important historical events and them with enough love interest to keep the story going battle of the the century struggle for the control of quebec an all of canada between the british and the french with form the new america it has the of a sweeping of but in the hands of writer pierre whose script deserves a award for worst of the season and the scattered and 
 enough i have actually seen the film that this film was a to it was called the fighting eagle and i saw it when i was just N years old it made such an awful impression on me that i never it i 've been an fan for a long time so when came out on tape i bought it i was to realize that it was a to the movie that i 'd seen so long ago 's has 
 i 'm we see even one this old film we do n't ordinarily get good opera films and here is a true grand opera the are not great it 's dated but as opera it ca n't be and i 'm an opera i ca n't even detect one if we did n't know that was in the audio nothing would convince me it is n't she does everything with her dark makeup is fine and she brought the role 
 this is a family comedy in the very best of the term about faith and family ann with the help of everybody 's favorite gets help in lifting the 's above the would-be schemes of john pure fun 
 version of a story that had been turned into the film in N england return of the concerning the pursuit by the police of a master criminal known as the because of the like get up eyes etc he of the good films from the N 's it 's a solid little entertainment clearly influenced by or did this influence the of the films the seems to be more a than a master thief while not the best of the 
 and horrible i was not surprised this short lived show did n't make it i remember when from the tried these episodes like they were actually scary coupled with bad acting and music i was surprised this showed was ever it never showed up again and one can only be for this 
 walt was particularly of quality so how come the producers at disney would release such a roughly acted even for family fare mess of a movie the big green had a good concept and since it is disney you know how the movie is going to turn out obviously but the big green is horrible the jokes are and steve still alive pulls in another terrible performance on his with too much time on their hands in small town are 
 & is another one of disney 's it was with of and the actors and with the a similar concept was used in mary when the children and mary disappear into the sidewalk art i am mainly rating this film through child 's eyes because i have not seen it in years back then it was one of my films it was and and the last scenes the conflict beginning with the walking into battle were my there was also 
 this is the of the are completely and the heroes are pure and are wonderful as well as the new actor who plays the role of outstanding performances magic funny and dramatic and a perfect ending make this film absolutely i 'm not so sure all content is appropriate for younger children but for an older audience there are plenty of the do not do this movie justice my and i were quite skeptical but were so we had taken 
 my friend gives me these N huge boxes they 're of gordon he says i 'm have some giant i say but not so this serial rocks but i had to & to almost everyone i knew to find a player for is really a little of everything in this serial there are & i guess you 'd call the sets & combine roman egyptian and there 's even like english and some of it was a those horrible with 
 if it 's an art and film there is not enough art not to mention it is a there is not enough it is a drama there is not enough drama and as far as are concerned there is not enough and too much thought it could be a for tony 's movie but there is no tony so i guess been it 's not tony it 's an action movie it lacks explosions which would have added some interest 
 this movie is just funny but funny to enjoy this movie completely you ca n't have a perception of how a film like this goes and just enjoy all the side jokes and which are involved with the film i still find the bit at the start funny when he says want a beer funny stuff but what makes the film decent is the fact that it does n't try to hard to create a serious spin on the film 
 it 's me again ' i sit through so you do n't have do you think this is about could it possibly be about a woman who call a sex line and arrange to meet in a area then her comes along and their with before they make off together with his cash what a guess and if i tell you that the who is put on the case is forced to team up with a assistant to these what 
 N 's is one of the best releases than this game well star wars star wars episode and the of of time are far better and superior games but i still love is the best from a movie second only to star wars the story is perfect it 's like you are in the movie graphics are excellent the movements are extremely realistic the enemies ' intelligence are the best part in this game i loved playing the stage in 
 after three outstanding television series ' and a christmas special the bizarre and yet characters of bleak town make the jump to along with their the league of mark steve and are the more familiar of the with the central roles shared between the in an added twist the final member of the team is portrayed by actor michael where to start is in conversation with his writing when of he is paid a visit by two of his characters 
 what else is left to say i 've read all the reviews here and most are right on however one person even went so far as to call this movie evil and that tainted it or something along those lines evil what a i mean basically made this film open your eyes this was the very lowest grade of nonsense that has come along in most thing about code is how much money they spent to make it if this 
 this movie is horrible if you pay attention to it it 's a perfect movie if you just watch the images dance across the screen each one with no apparent connection to the next i this movie because i 'm a david fan and i really appreciate in was in the film for a total of ten minutes and the and dance were and left something to be the moral of the story was really i could n't tell if 
 i saw this movie back in N on a with valley of the these movies helped a interest in in N i visited egypt seen today the egyptian from flat and a few but it 's a movie to look at the sort of thing hollywood just does n't do anymore and it has a great story not just the usual or affair too bad wo n't restored prints of this to be seen on the big screen 
 along with patrick and robert jack was an the very first proper episode of following two pilots murder by the book is not far off classic plays ken franklin one half of a murder mystery writing partnership his partner jim is the one ken has no talent other than the gift of the and a for promoting the books as soon as jim has decided he no longer requires ken 's marketing skills ken a plot to kill jim except 
 this is one of the best movie i have ever seen my parents comes from rural india and to some extend i have seen the life of the peoples are really poor and have financial and social problems the movie just reflects exactly the same full credit to the director and the actor they have done an excellent job i just wonder how can movies like and can go for and not i do n't understand the criteria on which 
 it 's true that this is not realistic story but romantic comedy is not a that i look to for what counts is that the characters are and as needed is beautiful and and is in an kind of way they have enough chemistry to make the story in the area that counts sexual attraction i would love to see either of them in another movie and yes the is pretty too 
 i do n't think you can get much worse then this put together bad actors fake and three stupid stories and what do you get this excuse for a first story immediately shows the bad video quality and the acting is just really especially when you bring in the N year old as a with the usually over the bit plus the man is ok but the woman is rather you look great not the in this one was the 
 now this show looks like most of the other shows of it 's type from the 's but the only thing is about this one is that it 's different they use a lot of comedy and action in this one and maybe a little bit of drama too i personally thought it was a good show i ca n't understand why would they cancel it the good thing is that the fan base of this show is still alive 
 this film is about a gap that exists between the real world and the world of the dead there 's a lot of about the if you install a program on the computer you see dead folks much like if you play a you 'll die in frankly most of this seemed rather silly and lost me what i did find interesting is the idea that the dead live within their own separate existence being totally alone for this was 
 a batch of films from blockbuster last night and this was the first one i watched it was late on a saturday night wanted a film fix this was awful almost so stupid story i really thought films like had put an end to actors delivering ' and dialogue that is hard to believe was actually and read off a page and scenes that are nothing to get excited about especially when in a film this poorly i 've always 
 i think a great many viewers missed entirely the fact that this is obviously a of western is not a bad movie it is a in take on i do n't believe this film was taking itself seriously for a makes this film even more unique is the fact it is centered around N strong beautiful women two of which are black one asian and a are n't your usual western women they 're tough they can draw fast and 
 in a sense this movie did not even compare to the novel however it was good to have a of what the looked like and also the if you are not good at as you read i would never recommend watching the movie rather than reading the book i hardly suggest even watching this film let alone any other films based on this literary work this movie and many others did not fulfill this book one important part that is

 of all of the mason movies i have seen this one is my least i have never liked as an actress she only seems to know how to play one type of character a career woman with some chip on her shoulder who for that reason is extremely difficult to in any way with this one is no exception it runs true to only thing that this movie in my opinion is an performance by scott as the prosecutor i 
 i ca n't believe people are looking for a plot in this film this is and up already these two were a their comic is as funny today as it was N years ago not a word out of either mouth and they were able to keep audiences in their comedy was n't sophisticated by any stretch if a cushion ca n't make you there 's no reason to watch any of the stuff these guys did it was a

 what i think i 'll probably like best about the new star wars film is that it will likely blow out of the water if you 'll the when it comes to sheer devastating box office receipts and thereby knock it out of the number one spot every time i hear someone declare is the greatest film they 've ever seen i think to myself you do n't see a lot of movies do you what a you could make 
 i loved good times with the rest of many of you i love reading and commentary the writers on this show were and the actors were beyond to answer the commentary to the other superior and positive commentary what happened was that james was killed in an accident i believe i remember that it was a trucking accident or car accident and it was the episode when it first aired and i was a tiny thing it was so sad 
 more of nothing if you are a rush fan you know what this video contains from the past the big N hits from the N 's and their efforts to remain contemporary they do succeed in making fun of themselves by beating the critics to the by portraying themselves as unfortunately they fail at protecting themselves from embarrassment of their faces only add to the fact that these guys have you are have been following as much as you can 
 i am a great fan of david lynch and have everything that he 's made on except for hotel room & the N hour movie so when i found out about this i immediately grabbed it and and what is this it 's a bunch of drawn black and white that are loud and and maybe i do n't know what 's good but maybe this is just a bunch of that was on the public under the name of 
 i 'm pretty sure would have considered this a the first two stories are decent nothing spectacular and then there 's what on earth was thinking it 's a random piece with little to recommend it one should feel frustrated at the lack of or conclusion but there 's only relief that it 's over 
 this movie may not have seemed like much to some people but it had everything i look for in a comedy fall down funny moments accompanied by a moment or two of seriously moving scenes great actors and pretty much everything a good movie is supposed to be like despite david playing his usual character he made this role into an unusual performance which i do n't think he had ever exceeded until he hit the screen with joe regardless 
 in stand by me and teddy discuss who was tougher or mighty mouse my friends and i often discuss who would win a fight too sometimes we get absurd and compare guys like and the or and but now it seems that we discuss guys like chan bruce lee and jet it is a comparison seeing that lee is dead but it is a fun one and if you go by what we have seen from jet in N and 
 i absolutely loved this movie i am not even sure what particularly about it but i think it was wonderful and should be available for the women were and yet got along well enough to spend the time they did in the in italy the actors in my opinion did an excellent job the characters were all so different and yet story that made it work there is humor drama and relationship issues all in good time this requires N 
 a review i have put off for far too long N is one of the best films made to date if not the very best stanley was a of a film maker and this is one of his very best works and although it is by many and respectively it is considered one of the best films of all time and i 'll have to agree back in N no one had done anything like this before and no one 
 in N was the hot actor after his performances in named desire and on the frank had yet to himself on the silver screen but 's portrayal as the nathan detroit helped with his is a great screen version of a great play and the choices of leads and support players are imagine a movie where this was his one and only role as he portrayed sky in addition the female leads jean simmons and her stage role as nathan 
 after reading several good reviews as well as hearing nice things about it by word of mouth i decided to rent come i must say i was rather disappointed the story was hard to follow because the film is set as a series of between the present and recent past that are very poorly executed the characters despite the actors best efforts are flat and the sex is and are more explicit than they need to be i 've never 
 the man is a smart movie that makes you what you 're doing with your life and what makes you when you see these people in like doing everyday events and realize that 's what we do and what we want in real life it really hits close to home this is a surprisingly effective movie that at the end leaves you asking questions about your direction and not so much the movie andreas is the main character whose life 
 the world of edward d. wood jr. is n't a particularly good it 's lackluster and cheap looking the people in it go off on which make it very and but this adds to it 's i say this because it 's a about an that made pictures and surrounded himself with fellow and as such there 's really no other way to document the life and career of the man and his crew of there are some of insight 
 clara is wonderful as the title character of the film essentially a film about a girl who moves to spain with her mom at the time of the spanish civil war it turns out the mother goes home to die and she is left with her she also makes friends and much in a short time jose is at first a to her then they become close the film is shot in soft colors mostly carol for her who is 
 this movie is a through the mind of a caught in his own philosophy he the ever question of am i ' and is i ' it 's a and thought enterprise there is a of beautiful images of the hand drawing itself or rather itself more and more we follow the writer in his over what to say and what to film we see him with his wife who left for peru leaving him to take care of their 
 i 've written at least a half dozen reviews of this little and none get published so i must that someone at really likes this awful movie the idea that a bunch of can a military tank that has set in the desert for over a decade and make a fighting machine of it again is so is the acting and direction pass on it

 i watched this film when i was a kid and i thought it was terrible then now that i 'm older i found it just as terrible universal could have done better than this they merely decided to make the most money they could out of using all their at once to me that was a cheap shot these characters were capable of holding their own in their own movies and the choice of actors was needed to be 's 
 i in my opinion is the single greatest novel ever written it is as close to as any creation can be reaches the pinnacle of her art this is at best a to the version is inevitable that version is far more to the spirit of the book and far more to are some good elements here kate having previously played in cold comfort farm clearly 's is a wonderful raymond makes an frank the production is but the are 
 when you watch the making of with this they tell you what is attempted they are the story of good evil & trying to it to a main stream movie audience in a modern society such as this is where the film fails there are way too many sheep in this movie people are too for this type of far as the acting & technical functions they are done chuck actually is ok as an as the appearance of as 
 this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen the highlight of the movie is a comparison between the of natural gas and a the acting is i know acting is hard work and stuff but that 's why it should be left to real actors watching these people act is like watching michael j. fox perform brain surgery it 's shaky at best one of the other comments would have you believe that the movie is saved 
 lee is a who turns himself in to the police or illegal gambling for reasons that seem unclear to me tony tony is a who a pool hall and spends his free time by being in the right place at the right time tony gets arrested with and is sent to jail where they form a bond that may not quite be friendship but it will do for film came to me under the title of frank and tony which 
 full house is a wonderful that is about a danny whose wife had just died in a car crash so danny asks his brother in law and best friend to help raise his three ' and this is my favorite show ever and i can watch it all day long and something on full house is always making me and there are sad parts also there is never a moment in full house the main characters are played by bob 
 not to waste your time watching this project i 've had my comment twice now for reasons that i have yet to understand other than the that someone involved with gone is n't happy with what i had to say so i 've things down to the this time with an of my original comments that can in no way be taken as a personal attack on anyone nor unfair commentary gone is the sort of train that gives new 
 my best guess is this piece of work will come out on sometime before movie was terrible the time line all over the place this would n't be so bad if it left some for the end it was entirely predictable pick on wants to know why they hate her so much die a terrible death girl goes home and looks crazy girl brought evil spirits with her makes neighbors go crazy and kill each other kid understands what 's 
 i had high hopes when i went into the theatre having seen the i was as as the next person to see great talent participate in the making of a story with a beautiful it 's disappointing to see this talent laid waste by the poor of words are and probably because it was composed with a more western theme i would n't find it difficult to imagine the same with french or english in they just sound musical items

 i 've bought the of all and it 's not truly a horrible movie but a lot of things could have been better it had a lot of historical value played out by very and it 's not an everyday that actors can play out such a role and have it be somewhat there were some parts that were a little and confusing but i would n't say that the entire movie was horrible once you think about that N 
 if you watch the extra you 'll note that the director is totally and was actually a of in a video store put two and two together and you is doing a for his old despite the being rather was that harsh well see this film and you 'll it is n't too slow in the beginning too in the middle and too slow to end that about sums it up eric & were the only two showing some and

 well first off if you 're checking out of the as some very early night of the living dead N film forget it this is about in a more psychological sense where that term merely someone who is not in control of their will but who must instead follow the will of another the here as little as they are in the film are largely for to the state or authority in general as in it is quite a stretch 
 this movie was recommended to me by a friend i never saw an ad or a so i did n't know was in it and was not bothered by the fact that his role was so small i thought the whole cast was suitable and found the film pretty all in all the opening scene with the small crew of standing at the side of the road looking and caught my attention immediately it had a way of telling you 
 for those expecting the cover art and story to indicate another entertaining indian production no musical dance numbers or of production value exist to the mood in this rather tired story of arranged in the british indian culture with a few variations thrown in as written by the script around topics worthy of discussion only to cover them up with routine tactics directs like a traffic trying to hold together the to the point of chris is a medical school

 this movie it really was a waste of my life the acting was the plot completely long long story short these people get by this killer but completely fail to fight back in any manner and this is after they take a on a trip with no gear and show up at a that is already assembled and completely with food and clothes and the daughters additionally after their boat goes missing they panic that they 're stuck in the 
 i caught this movie on last night and as i was sitting there watching it it occurred to me that it could quite possibly be the worst movie ever bad acting bad bad sound totally fight stupid characters all these made it up to be the most bad movie i 've ever seen it was so bad i was by it 's sheer lack of anything that i had to keep watching and they made a 
 the director was probably still in his early learning stages when he tried his hand at have a look at the everybody looks and as though ready for church even the horses look and this is a western for out loud it 's supposed to look dusty nasty and and then there 's the acting of the in this the whole lot a dozen or so all pretty and were just and but hardly a flows instead they all look

 dark waters has to rank as one of the most movies ever made i had expected at least some entertainment because john was involved and after seeing this movie i can say i lowered my opinion of mr. the acting is poor an excellent actor like should have demanded more from the cast and the director it was painfully obvious that mr. was just and hoping the check would not bounce to say that he just showed up would be

 my main comment on this movie is how was able to get credible actors to work on this movie impressive cast even for the supporting characters none of which helps this movie really i have to admit though tom 's almost made it worth it what was that about tom did you lose a bet the best of the movie was joe though by far a classic the is good 's character struggling with existence as a lady is making 
 why is it that any film about the last brings out the worst in movie making whatever attraction the woman had for the greatest roman of them all and his successor mark anthony never seems to come across on the screen as other than the of over high school seniors despite sets and this movie is as bad as any italian and of the N 's this kind of spectacular belongs on the big screen which is why went over 
 this movie is reminder of being just a of hollywood also tends to feed on past for its made this movie with the that a mix of and on the will bring home an it turned out to be the idea of the title is inspired from the classic in the original is shown as raising as of must move out of hollywood 's shadow if it needs to be taken seriously 
 great book poorly done movie performances and situations make this movie a flat and work from most of the actors leaves this film in the after school special category no doubt there is a lot of talent to be tapped in this cast and crew but something went wrong the very attempts to pull this film out of the but even she ca n't seem to rise above the silly dialogue feels like everyone just it in even the makeup 
 once again i must play something of the most of the reviews for ab have been extremely positive mine is positive but only slightly a N out of N is equivalent to a c letter grade from seems that a lot of the is rooted in two factors one that ab is more realistic than the typical film and two that it is trying to do things first point i could n't care less about i 'm not looking for 
 this is worse than awful it took a good story plot and turned it into the photography is extremely looks like a home movie project with cameras the appears to have been done by somebody having while on drugs and with scenes cut short followed by other unrelated scenes then segments of scenes in totally unnecessary and missing scenes scenes turning into scenes then suddenly back to obviously no tom wendy hughes and james mason 's good acting skills are 
 yet another version of mother of all classic and yet another case of due to media circus the film of as director is also the weakest in his including the other two being the and company the the magnetic of the two playing duo on screen for the first time is definitely a treat to watch out for not just strong performances but their perfect chemistry is the biggest scoring point here for which should be however the same equation 
 this film is terrible and do n't blame franco because its not his film was shot silent over many years by as he got the money to bring a crew and the actors together to do some shooting how much film actually shot is not clear although not all of the film or all of the are here since several key such as in a movie theater are in the hands of collectors or backers who would n't give them 
 years ago stanley released his true inner and became the hero of edge city by finding and wearing the god of 's the helped bring jim to the of comedy and reached a very popular status for its and just pure fun everyone knew how to party why i got now years later it seems to me that the same philosophy has been applied to the new movie son of the someone asked director lawrence guterman why are you making 
 i this and N as the best television series made both stand out in my mind because unlike early star series there is a consistent evolution of and characters if you look at the original star and star they were fine shows but there was no overall theme or plot that connected all the episodes in many ways you could usually watch the shows totally out of with no difficulty understanding what is this was less the case with deep 
 another taste of what a movie should be after batman dead end that just helps stimulate our taste and leave us wanting more this is what a real movie should look like and feel like even tough this is a of sorts the attention to detail character and action is real although this is a limited resources production it puts to shame big productions other related movies here the main and supporting characters act and look like they are real 
 the worst had no must see and many ones at that this took place in las vegas and made it 's employees dress up like egyptian they even changed howard name to which probably does n't mean anything the sight of seeing jim ross in that terrible still gives me to this day and i 'm N years old so you could imagine it when i was N years old bobby was funny included the giant in a poor match

 this is quite the story quite good and for the most part pretty accurate considering it is a tv movie rather than a they did create some characters and combine several actual people into one character but otherwise this is a good telling of a very and dark final moments of the movie the mass are almost directly taken from an audio recording made by jim jones this recording was made during the final N minutes of the peoples temple 
 i had borrowed the three movies from a friend and had watched them while sick in bed during one weekend i enjoyed every one of them i enjoyed how the last movie gave a of what and his sister were like when they grew up in addition i liked the of the song that first was heard during the credits of the first movie the title plain and tall however the one thing in winter 's end that i did

 to the small minority seen here this film get serious i know it 's down to peoples personal opinion at the end of the day but anyone with more than a couple of brain cells can surely see that this is total so bad it does not deserve to be part of this franchise i can only assume those saying how great this is are friends with somebody involved in the film and are trying to give their career a

 i loved this movie but then again i am a big fan if you have not seen a david film then this is not a good place to start the fly would be a place to start and then work up to before checking this one out this is certainly one of his best and takes the interactive game one step this game the players plug a game through a jack inserted into their and get into the game directly

 the movie was actually not that bad especially but the and actor they chose for the leading role was a little in the acting department i would have chosen someone else the idea of going to america was very and the main character questioning everything that he 'd ever known made him somewhat but not very much so when there 's a for a leading was interesting it brings about the question of how the subject of will be handled 
 the usual i do not give N star ratings to movies which are bad low budget and silly although they may deserve it these films are often funny and get rated based on entertainment value not as a representation of their film this film fits this model perfectly it is a mexican monster movie with and extremely weak effects the makeup is not that bad and the acting is sometimes quite entertaining but this film is almost as silly as

 this fourth installment of the series is the last to get a theatrical release though it feels like a direct to video 's ok i guess but nothing acting is the worst of seen in the series up to this like the third movie there is n't much in the way of the sentence directed by alan is never a good is the directors use when they want nothing to do with the its an acceptable movie in the series 
 the acting was n't great the story was full of turns and characters it 's about the of the struggle between block voters on the one side and the people living in the belgian city on the other side is it a political analysis is it some kind of belgian west side story or modern and the film just is n't strong enough to answer both questions those were the director 's questions too still some of the scenes could 
 playing a character from a literary classic can be a bit of a for an actor paying for the pleasure of a character by competing with the of generations of readers not to mention the numerous other actors who 've besieged the castle before fortunately for the this version with the cast and timothy stands head and above versions that have come after it it 's the right length to do the story full justice and makes considerable use of

 not only was this movie better than all the final season of lots but it was better than any movie made for tv i have ever seen looking at the top N i see that only one small screen movie has made it how the christmas i think it is time to increase that group to will admit that the original series had several shows that were better than this but i did n't mind i just loved being able 
 what made the idea of seeing this movie so attractive was the hope that it would live up to charlotte 's of the original classic story i was deeply disappointed to find that this movie which seemed to be either written or in great had not the that made the original novel so powerful much of the back and forth between the main characters and mr. rochester seemed to be either missing from the or left on the cutting room

 i have to admit this movie moved me to the extent that i burst in however i always think about things twice and instead of writing a that would define the film as and i prefer taking the risk of a closer what 's first the movie has an impact on the simply because it starts out and continues as a movie that does n't try to blow you away with the actual scenes from up for this of because

 i had to lower my rating of this movie to a N due to the terrible sound track i 'm pretty sure it was not a problem with me or the tape because some actors and the sound track sounded great but most of the actors voices were distorted or beyond recognition especially for are plenty of little that would make this an movie ending up in by mistake is great but much of the humor was lost in the

 case is college students can new teacher stop the believe me you wo n't a title like university one would immediately gather that this movie just is n't high art but worse than that university does n't even qualify for amusing garbage u is so poorly made the story is the characters are and the whole movie lacks any of to say there is no or atmosphere or this is n't even enough to throw in any for the cheapest

 i 'll keep it short and brief the people who wrote the story lines for this show are the actors are just perfect for the roles they play 's character is legendary and they have so much chemistry on screen which makes it what it is a very successful i saw first saw the new episodes which is probably going back just over months i what had happened to paul i was to find out that he had died when

 this movie was awful it centered too much around eddie clark 's eddie works much better when changing good such as in christmas vacation and vacation really do n't understand how a movie like this would be given the up now do n't get me wrong i like but just felt this movie was totally wrong for him and for the character in general this movie leaves much to be and really needed some bigger name actors

 seems to have a relationship with many of its viewers i personally loved the movie and everything about acting in some places could be improved upon but the adds to the atmosphere where the acting ca n't in some areas the dialogue is a bit and over dramatic but really what do you expect from the late over all did an amazing job in writing what i believe to be one of the most i 've ever seen it plays

 as a i watched this movie every time it was on tv and it was on a lot because of its humor it may not be what critics consider N star but i love it for what it is a fun comedy meant to please the audience the actors are of my generation probably why i love the movie so much and was like a fantasy cast of everyone 's favorite tv shows of the early N 's full house

 the original the man who knew too much brought alfred for the first time outside of the united kingdom of course part of the reason for the was that folks how on such a budget as compared to hollywood products was able to provide so much on the screen the original film was shot inside a whatever reason he chose this of all his films to now with an international reputation and a big hollywood studio behind him paramount decided

 i can hardly believe that this and badly staged film is by a whose other works i 've quite enjoyed the experience of the lady and the duke and no other word but will do left me in a mood a condition relieved only by reading the user comment by for not only has attempted with success to make us see the world through the art of century france but as has pointed out has shown at the cost of 
 no way this overly script with basically one character should be interpreted as feature entertainment in reality it has about enough material for an minute short and even that would seriously tax your attention span zero characters beyond noble are developed the never ending of and telephones are sleep and the script is so that a could have written it in fact this whole sad thing should n't have even been put on film a tape recording would have been

 well it 's about time van is back and in this action that 's his best film in recent years the plot is n't too but the whole border theme is interesting and the as drug twist is cool but what makes this movie is the fact that van is back to doing arts again his latest films have been more acting but in the is back to dropping the bad guys and looks to be in excellent shape there 
 what is worth that is omitted in the other reviews i have read here is the of how the law the lives and of in the era portrayed in the film while 's character is he is not the only one the often talked about mr. is the other and the reason that he is never seen the reason to that he has disappeared seems to be that he has been by the police for homosexual activity a criminal in

 what did i expect i thought this would be a film about young adults at their in life something like or american pie which i liked a lot i wanted to see a funny film perhaps with an ironic look on and what did i get attention ahead this film starts with a lengthy dialogue which gives you a good hint of what will inevitably follow more lengthy sometimes i thought might have forgotten his text and trying to hide 
 this film does a job of the plight of an 's disease the subject is done with as well as humor carter is so convincing as a person with that i found it hard to believe that she was only acting kenneth a actor lives up to expectations as the artist who and is forced to provide to 's character as part of his community service an alternative to prison time watching the development of the relationship between these two 
 that 's not just my considered verdict on this film but also on the bulk of what has been written about it now do n't get me wrong here either i 'm not a total i did n't hate the movie because it was n't enough like academy N ' or whatever i enjoy more than my fair share of high or stuff i ' is poor and i am as to why it is seemingly so long nonsense from

 the best thing i can say about this film is that it is it did not fall flat the next best things are the supporting performances by the actor playing edward the always taylor and the actor playing taylor 's husband the actor helping to 's potential in an early scene brings a quality to the proceedings that 's about it on the positive whom i is far more for than in any scene where he 's attempting to be

 i usually steer clear of film and do n't enjoy comedy but i must say that this picture was great i immediately recognized david from the tv show numbers and and karen black were at their usual best this is comedy at an high level with spoken and that kept the audience and me laughing throughout a rather deep rooted to mr. for dealing with a delicate but real subject in a manner that can be enjoyed but fully absorbed

 my wife and i could n't even finish the film truly it was rather the historical is not so much by the events themselves as the ridiculous of the characters for instance takes the burden of power only with great reluctance indeed he is portrayed as if he 's some sort of great and in the camp my lord the is bad i recall the soap opera my mother watched when i was a child having better than this the

 i liked the whole set up with 's palace the roman guards and in this event also marked the passing of the as far as the voice of the goes who had done the play by play for every up to this point opens up and gives the typical introduction making it look like he 's there to announce another but then jim ross who is making his debut and jr continues to do the commentary to this day but

 i read most of the comments here were everybody saw only the flaws of the movie i agree the director it 's not the actors are not winners but it has something everyone could to i do n't want to but telling more then the plot the finishing of school and the trip to a big party or if you like to see beyond the is choosing the way trough life remember that days of youth the days when you

 what i expected a rather portrayal of a guy and an equally portrayal of the who likes him yet while being second to his overly support for his favorite sports i got an story where both guy and end up admitting to themselves and each other that they each have in their lives yet each can the other to save the love they but with the humor and performances this story works is classic that perfect of sweet strong and

 i do n't particularly care from michael jackson aside from being a i really do not like his music with the exceptions of a few from his landmark this is one of them i do like this video because it is one of the first and most important music ever was directed by john best known to fans as the director of an american in london this music video is not so much a music video but more or less

 what ever happened to one of the most innovative and brilliant of our time well he made the kind of typical summer action that could 've been directed by anybody available out of film school and in fact they probably would 've done a better job they would 've at least have put half of a thought into the plays an who traveled through some sort of and landed in a planet ruled by except this time around the through

 this movie was clearly an early attempt for a new director but still succeeded in being original and entertaining as well as in some moments however i have to say the story would not have come across as well without the performance of paul anthony as he made the well written parts very and affecting and the more written parts much more also i have to mention the performance by alan it was to see him in a part like 
 i watched this movie every chance i got back in the when it came out on cable it was my introduction to which has me and bill clinton ever since i was still very young and the movie made a big impression on me it was great to see a movie about other young growing up trying to decide whom they wanted to be and making some bad choices as well as good ones i was by 's beauty the

 this movie was an waste of time it 's nothing but a movie it contains a very predictable plot my feelings are to the characters and the dialogue is at best half the time you are looking for something else to do because the movie is that boring since you already know what 's going to happen the other half of the time you 're desperately hoping the grows a pair of balls or just ends his life by jumping 
 if you want to go see this movie just give me our money you were it counts and you 'll have the same amount of fun guarantee more fun this movie once again shows what happens ca n't get any one else to hire your family and your forced to own movies same i 'm going through humor jokes and this movie is really a to movie to shock you into laughing because you ca n't believe the levels to

 i saw this movie on a night i could n't sleep i loved it and searched to find out when it would be on again probably the best movie i have ever seen at the time and even now the cast is full of people i had never seen before but it seems like a real life story based out of this is the kind of movie that the pleasure because you see it hear it and feel it from

 i know that 's not what you expect from a film with this sort it 's a direct of the best years of our the men films dealing with men who are in the with circumstances but this film is full of and performances it features performances and hunt including a rather scene and and william as levy his book of outsiders about the independent the is to detail with a down to earth it ' s at and sad

 i really liked this features john wayne in his first then you can tell wayne has a real presence although he would n't really mature into the he is known for until N years later in 's about from all over the country heading to the new west to 's character coleman joins up but for his own personal of the main actors were stage actors and had never done a film before which makes the movie even more managed

 the best way for me to describe which is high on the list of my films is the that came from a companion after the film ended i did n't know films could be made like that entirely original in it 's style it is one of the best examples of what can be it 's as far away from the master and coverage style of shooting as one can get perfectly many of image sound effects dialogue voice over 
 unlike other i found this film even with all its and the acting of some of the a i found that the experiments interesting and the hardware realistic although the reading of people minds via computer sounds experiments are being conducted now to do just this i will note that this experiments are in a very early stage with results so far not characters in the movie are well cast the girl although a bit looks suitable the truck driver 
 routine about a dillon who gives his to a clinic of human and starts to the lives of the woman and his husband mancuso extremely predictable and with tone all the way do n't lose your time with this one make a baby instead 
 this episode is certainly different than all the other though some of the details are still there the is completely different that makes this unique and interesting to watch even though at times you might wish for the old i liked it a lot but then i like almost any 
 i personally liked this movie and am alarmed at the rating 's some people have given it it is a movie based on a comic book and it is now if you do n't like comic books or then of course you wo n't like this movie so why did you watch and bother to rate it is beyond me though if you are a fan of interesting strong characters and women and saving the world hell you will love 
 i 'm not sure why i picked for a borrow from mom for i think just because i had heard a little bit of this movie but i 'm glad i did is an original and movie that has humor and a side this was one of 's first big one 's before hitting it major in hollywood i can see why she is an incredible actress the scene where she finally what had happened and she 's on the 
 this was a episode one of the best of both seasons down right for a change with a story that is way way above the average episodes if there is such a thing a man 's wife is almost burned to death in a car in which he was driving his worked her 's did n't she is burned beyond recognition great makeup and not given much of a chance to live without a full skin but even in a 
 what was the worst movie of N cat in the hat i propose that it was this little film from earlier in the year badly written badly and if i may be so bold badly acted the order is the black hole of film a movie so not even the bit of entertainment could escape from its event horizon of it is n't even funny like for example you know that the producers are assuming that their audience is n't 
 i found this episode to be one of i 've seen in a long time the south park have done the best of a film i have ever have truly touched on 's underlying social commentary that he has made with each one of his films i would love to know what george 's opinion was on this episode i 'm sure it was positive keeping his true vision for his fully intact most deal with the pure without making 
 beat a path to this important that looks like an attractive feature lie $ N is simply a better version of 's book love and that was a an of literary fraud and of a pretty woman lie $ is the very best in reality and 's is by moving of smoke i disagree with variety that it 's instead my one slight problem was with the nature of its key players commenting on others ' on a single watching

 if i across this script in form i would read it and maybe i would not however at the points in the film where the director would seem to want me to although i am still not altogether sure where these are i do n't care if this is allen this writer can not write dialogue or at least he can not write dialogue then draw performances from actors capable of drawing from even the most of for example i 
 an entertaining and film has drawn comparisons with run run the film quickly develops into a chase during which the viewers learn about the three main characters through and the chase serves not as as a but as a that makes up the majority of the film during the run we see the characters grow and forget about their lives about the roles they 've bought into and eventually about why they started running in the first place much like 
 this movie film history in every way no one what anyone thinks about this movie because it criticism every flaw in the movie is easily overcome by the many amazing things the movie has going for it it is an extremely beautiful movie and i doubt many of us will see anything like it again i 've seen it more times than i care to count and i still become every time with a feeling which is hard to describe 
 for those of you out there who have seen this on i would recommend the in fact the is the main reason is that the film was shot N and the producers ran out of money making the version and released it as N the result is that several actors are not on screen at all and in many drag races less than half the cars are showing since one is on each side of the screen the is actually 
 it me to rate a movie with a lot of my favorite actors locations and douglas washington d.c. and political but ' really hits a low it 's like they had a great idea up front signed the right cast and had some great city shots and then took a holiday letting the remaining crew the rest and i wish i could blame it on yet another performance from not only do i feel she 's one of the worst 
 this is a movie i had never even thought of seeing until my N year old spotted it at the video store and grabbed it after the cover picture of the animals on island we got it and have watched it repeatedly since in fact we 've it several times since there are very few movies that my son will watch and pay attention to what a nice change from and the little the acting is outstanding the are compelling 
 this film is a great comedy drama christopher is tremendous in his supporting role as manager and his commentary will keep you laughing robin williams plays a great role as a quick jon stewart and will you if you are fans of comedy central the show is good because if the has they will see it as a very needed attack on the policies of the current republican government and a criticism on the american democratic process not to mention 
 joan had just begun her working girl makes good phase with the dynamic paid N she had never attempted a role like that before and critics were impressed so while other were wondering why their careers were because they were to characters that had been the in thing a few years before but were now becoming joan was listening to the public and her as an actress the depression was here and jazz age who survived on an endless round 
 bad script check awful effects check horrible actors check direction seeing the box at blockbuster video and being a fan of the i placed my $ on the line and this film my girlfriend was out of town and i was so on a late tuesday night i decided this would be a perfect time for me to watch what appeared to be based on the box cover art a movie what i got instead was the worst film ever

 fortunately for us real fans most likely all baby boomers who in the late N 's and N 's three of the adult appeared when they did for the show in tony and richard both died shortly thereafter as as it was to see and together again it was equally about the complete absence of any mention of reed and michael it is my understanding that little had passed away in N but i 'm not sure how there is 
 i watched this as part of a movie marathon with research intent otherwise there is no way i 'd have watched it all the way through the first scene a bunch of in very bad seemingly get by various slow moving weapons by an even slower moving van in black and white with a voice over sets the pace for the entire rest of the film the fight scenes look ridiculous the would be funny if the acting was n't 
 ok when i this several years ago i had the worst expectations yes the acting is n't great and the picture itself looks dated but as i sat there a strange thing happened i started to like it the action is great and there are few scenes that make you jump james maybe one of the greatest actors next to bruce campbell is great as always the story is n't bad either now i would n't rush out and buy 
 there have been several comments already on the site focusing on the prestige feel of the film and there is a lot of talent on show from and to the design and scoring to the direction no wonder that andrew lloyd 's acceptance speech for at that year 's began well god that the english patient had no in it writing of winners takes me to who in a cast gives a beautiful performance it is to see that the 
 this movie started slowly then gained momentum the middle however the fact that the movie ran over two nights broke that momentum at its peak the second part really got interesting but then gave way to a simply ending playing football in the yard really could it get any more and now i hear plans for a similar movie based on the i wo n't make any great efforts to tune into that one if it 's anything like the 
 this movie was so horrible i want to beat the hell out of who ever made this movie i was a original fan of all the movies but when i seen this i just began to cry i could not handle it there are not even in it like the original creative this is so cheap i come on a bull no one wants to see the they wanted to see what the movie is about i am i right 
 an excellent i personally remember this growing up in in the early N 's this movie is for anyone that was n't around during that time shows the one thing the african american felt was solely theirs and the love and you see is real the people are real and few are still alive as this is being written the balls are still held but not to the extent that they were in the the that time is gone forever 
 i remember seeing a of this movie on hbo when i was a kid and it scared the ever living out of me when i found it i watched it i wish i had n't the movie was n't plot around an old woman running the castle she feeds this person in the of a N century castle she the poor guy every day and feeds him well that day she dies then a few months later a family moves

 it has been recorded that john ford made the big blockbuster movies so that he could afford to make the small movies that he loved so well master with a young ben johnson is clearly one of his best if not the best of his small movies the location shooting the the work with horses and the of the plains indian are all trade marks of ford as in many of his other films the great russian director 's influence 
 there 's enough star power in the house of spirits to create another yet the final product is pretty the film and its messages are very noble and i think perhaps most would agree with them liberal democracy good violent regime bad good bad etc unfortunately we 're battered from head to with these and as much is used as i 've described them ultimately we are left watching very noble people without any flaws off with nasty who have 
 though i had sort of enjoyed the of N i knew i should n't expect too much from its even more predecessor surely the least of the marcus on the audio commentary for the creeping N even goes so far as to call it the studio 's the film really due to its totally and now dated of the the setting actually rather better even if truth be told it 's still to like N N or van N despite 
 i have always susan for her integrity and honesty in her private life as well as her as an actor i found it strange that she would appear in a film that so distorted that facts her character 's rescue from the south was done by a canadian charter company from alberta flying a canadian designed and built aircraft the trip had been turned down by the us navy and coast guard as beyond their the same company staged a 
 where to start how does a serious actress like moore got involved in such first blood might be rated as bull but this type of nonsense is just with point of course if you are interested in the moore just wants to prove that a woman can be part of the navy that is the most stupid one i can think of you 'll say is a great movie just the performance from made this movie but hell i ca 
 i remember watching police when it first came on abc in N and i thought it was a very funny show thanks to the many sight and scripts filled with word play in one episode there was a line where a man named once was shot twice but unfortunately abc canceled the show after only six episodes i felt it a much longer run but a network executive thought the show demanded too much attention of the because of all 
 i 'm not going to go into too much but showtime was a pretty funny movie there was n't any funny scenes that i can remember but it had it 's moments the cast is pretty good robert de is good as usual and eddie murphy pulls off a pretty funny performance was just fine in the film no complaints there there were two characters in the story that i liked that they did n't explain much at all the 
 bad acting are very awful second between each text bad music bad effect and always the same plan during the movie if you want go it for the fool 
 the movie was very good i 'm an mystery fan and i usually figure out who is going to be killed and who did the killing while i did figure out who was going to be killed i did n't figure out who did it i was n't happy with the portrayal of the character but given the year the movie was supposed to take place it is possible the woman would have been that ' please know that while 
 this is a nice piece of work very and engaging enough plot to keep my interest throughout its main disadvantage is that it seems like it was full screen and though there were several sex scenes there was absolutely no but boy did it come close strange too since shows that it was rated very and i wish made more movies like stated that it was part of a series but i have been unable to find out what series 
 banks needs to teach these that it 's not all about being beautiful on the outside the inside counts for something too a lot of the past winners have looked decent but are and starting trouble for the other i see less involved with the in every season about the only thing worth watching top model for is mr. jay manuel recently had a who was a i felt that she should have done more to encourage her it was 
 i registered for just to comment on this movie i just got done sitting through this movie and the only thing that impressed me was that i somehow had the will power to not stop 've seen a pretty decent number of action movies and what not but has some of the worst fights i 've ever seen in a movie most of the fighting involves the back and fourth and hoping the opponent is n't doing the same i 
 this film has possibly the worst title for a short ever up somewhat given the actual minute can do without any of the stuff but i will admit to having a few moments from the comedy offered by and larry in some of the new and to those guys for trying to give it their all considering the position they were forced into in even making these dogs bright spot to this and the last debacle on the ocean is 
 this movie should have been billed as three linked together to form a feature film including lots of shots of people slowly walking down dark and streets be warned the first hour of this movie is simply a of the first two movies as told by the main character the actual movie does n't start until the thing is almost over i must say the on the part of the bat is quite for the robot i thought a robot 
 warning here be why do i waste my hastily years watching garbage like this this film is an impressive collection of poor writing worse and then we have n't even got to the acting yet and of course you can predict the whole story from beginning to expert fights against stupid corrupt and incompetent one goes off all the heroes who somehow manage to get out alive in spite of going through all sorts of corrupt partner who caused the

 first i have to say that i really love and have always had respect for but nothing could save this train of a movie does not even appear till much later in the movie and the acting from everyone is just terrible the script is all over the place the is wooden the action is and the plot could be up on a i really wanted to find something in this movie but found myself holding my hands over my 
 i picked this up in the after dark ' box set and watched it solely because of my interest in the performance of and i expected a film that was a huge and with very bad dialogue which is exactly what it would have been if it had been made in america instead i found myself by the good development of the characters and the way that develops through the movie as a person the acting skills of both stars 
 this movie would have been indeed probably excellent if the directors would have left the interviews and the concert separate into the is a great song and i hate how it is cut off at the best part to go to an interview with that should have been at the end of the film or located in a special feature the best part of concert is to put them on and let the music play but black the last is

 i saw this movie at the N palm springs international film festival and it is a movie and not a film since it apparently was shot by hbo to be shown on their cable network sometime this year this movie presents page as a and discipline and b & d film actress who had enough talent to become a real actress page was a little more than that and the film on some of her other roles in but not

 this movie is the biggest waste of nine dollars that i 've spent in a very very long time if you knew how often i went to the movies you 'd probably say that 's hard to imagine but it 's true after seeing the for this movie i knew that i had to see it if you 're a fan of mystery and why would n't you the is nothing less than intriguing and exciting unfortunately the movie is 
 god cuts himself with a straight he gives birth to mother earth which then gives birth through son of earth this is a one and a movie that sort of a dark version of how god created the world its dark and the most important aspect of the film to me is the its shot in a very black and white film using both and normal shooting sometimes even fast film and the scenes are long and dragged out that 
 it 's fun and fast as one leads to another and another toward an inevitable surprising conclusion the this holiday from all others one how the pieces are going to fit both during the movie and in the character actors laid the foundation and us in the process frank shows us what manipulation can get and ultimately what manipulation can cost uncle up each person for us while trying to protect barbara and this helps us decide who we are 
 this minor boasts a top cast and many scenes the big is the complete for the spanish characters in the film are played by a boyer a belgian a and a and to top it all off is supposed to be an english despite these the performances are all very good especially those of and but the scene in which boyer and meet and talk in wildly different is a real and i guess seeing as how they were alone 
 yes watch this movie if you like films this is maybe the best mexican picture since alley just because the excellent cast the direction and a many people did not like ' they think it 's very aggressive but they did n't understand that it was just a representation with of the mexican society but so similar to all the third world families i hope that benjamin and bruno who in this movie gives another example of his as an 
 the snow queen is based on the famous and very beautiful by christian about a girl who goes on a dangerous to rescue her friend from the of the snow queen this attempts to capture that story 's sense of and through sets and production design but fails on a number of so many productions the potential of the story is completely undercut by and direction the two actors playing and are but as the snow queen looks the part 
 what can i say a movie being horrible he acts very well but it is a horrible story along with horrible direction in my kind opinion the director must give up there is a lot of tragedy throughout the movie apart from that one can just not believe how true were those crimes there was no in the movie is just running out of stories but both and act really well the look too though their performance was not bad 
 the plot of involves college kids who play a phone game that unexpectedly to them if not to fans of gets them in over their heads the story of on the other hand is that of a film that had a little bit of promise by really bad could have been a fun if somewhat silly old-fashioned tale is early on by its ' belief that the audience would enjoy watching a bunch of loud rich kids at each other 
 i just saw and i have to say that it was the best movie that i 've seen in years unlike the recent trend of N 's this movie is more concerned with being than it is with being for those out there that there is not one reference to the rules in this movie even though the old movie rules do apply here this is the perfect of N 's and N 's you get the style and good 
 friday the step over there is officially a worse movie than your series out there i won this movie in a contest at college and it was a waste of money even if it was free jack jones stars as a truly awful singer whose trying to find some or something at least friday the never me i 'd rather have my pulled than see this again

 i know that actors and like to try different kinds of movies no one wants to get but danny happy birthday and christopher lloyd should have known better than this angels in the is another movie in which everything seems lost until someone or something comes and the day do i even need to tell you how it ends the movie is just plain examples of high are the various movies from the if these movies had some political or

 i think it great example of the differences between two it would be a great movie to show in a class i thought it was pretty funny and i must say that i am a for that lets band together and get the job done plot device it seems most people do n't realize that this movie is not just a comedy it has a few dramatic elements in it as well and i think they in overall i give

 this movie is not because it 's poorly directed acted sung etc but because it 's really difficult to a movie using an yet unfortunately this is the only thing the movie succeeds in doing the musical in the movie was much better than in the director of is proof that you do n't need talent to be a director all you need are to give a sample of the an aging is shot with in the harsh and just

 remember the bunny it was this show that started on the independent film channel but got turned into a full on fox my and i thought it was pretty funny beyond the idea of taking on material who kill occurs in a similar universe where live in the same world as people and like us take on jobs and lives of their own let 's just say if you could n't handle that then do n't bother watching as this 
 what a bad bad film i ca n't believe all the that has been on this excuse for a real movie i left the theater before the end stunned by how bad the direction and of that movie were and to read that claim there is truth and reality in this film when all it is in reality is a attempt at pulling the over the eyes of and by being cheap and least this film showed me once and 
 the word actually means a small sharp wooden game instrument that is used in a game called a to in india the use of the word as for the principal character is as it one who is sharp fast and can hurt badly when in the wrong is one of the best movies for and in it is in its pace and action the movie never for a moment and keep you always with some exciting action the movie is 
 the best and movie about female football fans only slightly better than the N of set in north london by the way i just watched this on film N and am my inability to set the is easily my second football movie after mike england manager but this time with the added twist of looking like a guerrilla piece of from a team who apparently keep making movies which are banned in the country in which they are made just 
 very surprisingly film about five medical students themselves and then being to share their of death and what lies beyond joel directs with some creating some very scenes as well as particularly beautiful ones the of death are not what viewers might expect nor is that which us all when we go thanks to peter who really did an outstanding job coming up with this story while the creativity of the story is impressive the story has many as well 
 the big problem i had with this movie was that 's character is as another user put it plays the role of ann smith who believes she is married to david smith played well by the sharply dressed yet robert montgomery the movie has some funny moments especially when montgomery 's character goes to great to try to get his wife back she is upset because the marriage is technically not legal but she only finds out three years into 
 think stage play this is worth seeing once for the performances of lionel and compare the douglas in ghost story with the douglas of this film are there at loose in this ' village or is there a more natural equally explanation is a red who is cast as an especially character it 's fun to look at his different in what is really a stock character not much happens for a long time but then we discover that 's

 one of my favorite movies with a very ending the movie is about the sullivan family obviously michael sullivan the father is one of the main members of the mafia the killer to say it this way and an expert one one of the kids wants to know the work of his father a terrible mistake so he on his father 's car and well he sees tom in action to say it this does n't rules in mafia nobody 
 everybody seems to compare this to the and the floor and when i first saw it i would have agreed i was expecting the and was a little disappointed but upon repeated my respect for this movie has grown thing to keep in mind is that the is a great action movie with some thrown in the floor is a action movie with some slightly more interesting thrown in is not an action movie at all and is not as 
 i would say this is a background movie play it the background as your to busy work checking etc i thought this was a film that was done before adams became successful after wrong it was done in N the is pretty awful i love but the is just average and does n't move the plot along it almost seems like it 's a made for tv movie based on the am i watching a tv show even the secretary 
 the incident is by far the director 's best film which is n't saying much in his past films and i use the term films the director takes ideas from hollywood and severely them the incident is no different the movie is basically con air meets aliens done with the of your average film school production the film is with shots and plagued by special effects that would have trouble most high school computer classes for example almost every explosion 
 this movie is such bunch of people trapped in an abandoned school they start getting killed off they know they are being so what do they do one girl decides to take a another decides to on her husband who is also there with an old so they somehow find a bed in an old abandoned school and go at it comes through with the and the & it 's also interesting from a point of view where the usual 
 this is a great example of what could have been a great film and a great idea but turned out to be really bad in the process i was mainly to get this because of the cover stupid me but i did anyway and i was away in a bad sense this movie is essentially about el havoc around los angeles and it 's up to a local animal and a writer to save the day before two corrupt and 
 done in a style late N 's and supposed of the mainstream government are arrested and given a choice upon sentencing for their wrong there is a choice of going to prison for N years to life or spending three days and two nights in a southern california desert at punishment park in the N degree heat the are to some odd miles to an american flag for their freedom us and state law enforcers will follow two hours latter 
 one how the script came to be and the other performers do an ok job but as it is neither comedy romantic or anything else it is all rather feels as if one of the had been pursued it could have been something it is nonetheless interesting to see a real turkey of a story made just before the usa became directly involved with the war i wonder if the surrounding politics had something to do with trying to make 
 another for based mainly on industrial and some it 's a that the for is used in such manner i am a fan of christopher lambert but i have to admit that he is getting worse as an actor and his movies too rent it if you are only 
 it 's remarkable and quite how writers and directors continue to make great movies out of one of the oldest and most over used story lines in dog dog is basically not much more than just the simple story of an lone copper chasing a brilliant criminal only his film from the rest by being extremely violent & this is one of the and most movies i 've ever seen with an atmosphere of constant and characters that seem to 
 i 'm a big fan of the vacation franchise and i love as eddie and at least a couple of the names were involved in this project most notably simmons who produced or all N of the theatrical releases as well as animal house for those reasons i figured this spin off might be worth checking out even without chevy the record i did not expect it to be very good i just thought it might be a slightly amusing 
 i saw this a couple of nights back not expecting too much and it did n't deliver anything too exciting the plot set up of a crew of for going around in their killing space and people is quite sound and had the film been handled better it might well have been something quite unfortunately after a fairly decent opening the sense of actual quality starts to drain away from the film leaving something behind that though is quite bad 
 the film is not stunning in the conventional sense it does n't present a series of pretty pictures instead it is a interesting film it forces the to constantly process or perhaps imagine the context of the various shots this sort of thing is easy to try but hard to succeed at the film refuses to use the of a to help the less than fully engaged get what 's going on instead the film on and moves through a 
 this was a and mess i needed a when it was over it goes something like some are murdered and a woman is assigned to the case she that the victims to an underground society and she an associate of the group who may have relevant information since the is an attractive woman of course she is and which reveals much about hollywood and its about women what 's surprising is that none of this is very or interesting just

 where do i start the box should have been enough to keep me away from this attempt but i 'd been taught early on not to judge a book or movie by its cover so i ignored the quality of the box and it anyway but common sense should tell you that if they ca n't do a single still image properly then how dismal will the moving ones be later they were pretty actors in this appeared totally they 
 it 's a movie i only seen it once but it 's very good if you like music like in 's and do n't have problem with drugs it 's movie it 's only a little bit to short but when you watch the movie make sure your sound system is at N then you will love the music in the film and the funny things that a guy from the country comes never drink any alcohol and then he

 in all truth this really is n't a movie so much as an extended final episode by this i mean that had you not followed the tv series life on the street i suspect that you would have a hard time following this movie having said that the movie is still a great watch i think it says a lot about a television production that every single cast member would return many after years of absence to once again their

 marks the only venture of both paul and director robert altman into the of science it was said of that he could not do comedy but he tried until he finally scored a real success in that with shot but the failure of this film left him gun shy and he never tried it is one of the biggest films i 've ever seen it 's a ice age brought on by who knows what but presumably it 's a 
 go see this movie for the of andy 's and treat yourself to a and experience the music perfectly the but never draws attention itself some called the interview with the artist a weak spot but consider this why would you expand on this in a movie if you can read andy 's at length in his books or attend one of his excellent this medium is much more suitable to show the nature of the artist 's works and 
 i started to watch this movie expecting nothing just another movie to watch but since the first minutes the and main character who is does n't talk much really got me in this really liked this movie it was dark acted and really it 's a bit slow but the was complete the was by letting us know by the story leading to the conviction of and his life behind bars the music was really great and very well incorporated 
 after too many years of waiting anne ' noted N book the house next door has finally been the result a bit from the novel which especially in the first story of the is if as it 's a tv film the whole of which is and actually very good just not as great as the book one of stephen king 's and one of mine as more running time and fewer constraints as a theatrical release all the inherent 
 i watched this movie with my mother when i was in high school many years ago i definitely was not the least bit interested in opera at the time but he changed my views i enjoyed this movie very much and have truly enjoyed opera ever since i even bought several of his cd 's who what his acting were he basically just played himself which was he was so so i just wanted to him i feel very sad 
 as can be read in many reviews here it is a movie you love or hate apparently not so much space for opinions in between i for one think that is a good sign i always this movie although the is not my typical style i never watched for instance and am not planning to english patient because it shows how people can be different when they are in an exotic environment as opposed when they are ' it shows 
 N 's just before is one of the best of out there it 's one of the of the N 's and it easily movies like the final do n't go in the woods or the out of the group of young adults come to check out the mountain property that one of the group has just bought however they are not alone in the wild a who seems to be in two places at once is and apparently director 
 this is one of the music anyone will ever see and hear i grew up when all my ' was brand new and to hear it again today by the original artist today is a measure of sir 's power to any crowd of any age this goes way behind the scenes to show us life on the road not just for the band but everyone down to the i saw this guy live in N and can assure you 
 i had no real expectations going into this movie and i 'm glad even if i had expected it to be bad i would have been to start first i think N of the movie of stock of in a dark i get it there 's i think the title was not a damn thing is ever explained regarding the and there 's too many times where i was left going third the movie takes itself seriously i 'm all 
 when i was driving home after work i bought some movies for my four year old i had bought this movie my kids would enjoy i watched this with my children my N and N year old were about to throw up in this movie the acts like a my little ones would watch it every day they threw away all our sold the jones movie on my grade i rather be seen on the worst dress kids now hate 
 and the almost made me cry my N year old left the room and ended up doing a i do n't know what age group this was written for but the writer did n't even want credit as for the song it 's mildly amusing at least it was a decade ago there are many christmas movies to watch although i 've seen some many more times than this they are still whenever this comes on i try to encourage 
 that 's what i kept asking myself while watching this film i mean the amount of and sex was one thing but another part of the movie which gave its to the adult industry was its lack of really i just wanted to get up and leave during the whole movie but i i in the hope that maybe the would get better that there might be a good twist at the end however i could n't have been more 
 if you have never viewed this film and like old time veteran actors this is the film for you seeing frank when he was very young and extremely thin with in and a wonderful voice which sang some great old morgan gave an outstanding performance with plenty of dance and musical numbers leon gave a great supporting role along with victor sir victor victor who performed classical piano and no stick comedy like he did in his career this is 
 though not a complete waste of time ' really was n't all sweet as it to be nor are the ages of the actors they 're portraying N my could have actually shown up in the film telling us he was N and ask us to believe it even michael j. fox was more as a in to the future ' parts ii and iii maybe not they 're probably equal if you can get past the obvious age flaw 
 this movie just let me say now that i totally agree with what had to say about this what was sam thinking she was with a guy who told her he loved her N times in total was extremely hot and stuck with her though her trying times but she decided to break up with him no on him with a loser who never said he loved her in the entire movie oh wait he wrote it on the wall 
 first of all i have to say that i am not generally a big fan of movies in general it 's not that i do n't like them just that i do n't like them a lot there are some that i have enjoyed of london N stuart walker an american in london N john and some that i have thought were but nothing special the wolf man N george the N joe dog soldiers N neil marshall are some 
 no comment stupid movie acting average or worse no sense at all it 
 i really do fail to see the actual surplus value of this movie it 's not bad enough to be there 's no or although there was plenty of opportunity there 's no there 's no in the first hour of the movie there 's way to much scenes of tourist having a party and playing music that last part was actually funny on many occasions you see these hitting and ' and that 's indeed what you hear badly 
 as part of the celebration of the release of casino this film with the new bond in it was shown from director roger hill i almost turned it off for being a bit boring but i 'm glad i stuck with it basically may anne is a single mother of who hardly sees anyone and has not had a in years her daughter says that she might want to get married to her new daniel craig of course after knowing 
 there are many kinds of shows one kind is where old actors are taken out of and set to characters they have n't played for or years these have mixed results return to ' despite some was return to green acres ' as eddie albert used a word for the script i wo n't repeat here but both it and the movie rescue from 's island ' filled in a necessary gap in the story of the though the show 
 swift 's writing really has more in common with and than with writers so it 's that 's has been deemed a children 's novel lucky the same applies to this movie there have been some really awful versions of this story which must be why people are reluctant to look at this version i mean it 's a and it comes from jim so how should we expect anything but look again beauty turns up in the places children 
 is probably one of the best movies ever has it all action movie is for action 's either you like it a lot either you hate it and if you hate it it means you do n't like action or takes his role seriously and he his the perfect guy for 
 led me to this unfortunately i did n't rent it i bought it the most disturbing thing about this film is that it 's not so disturbing for reasons known only to them the makers of this film set out to show the human side of are you me the man gave new meaning to the term finger ' good and with all the and i had trouble following the story all in all 's performance was n't too bad 
 this is a movie that i watched when i was a young girl and never it is certainly not the best movie ever made but there is something very special about it that i ca n't quite put my finger on i love it i am the kind of person who likes everything explained to me though and for that reason alone this movie drives me crazy exactly is that and what is her relationship with tom why and how 
 this movie is told through the eyes of a young teacher at a catholic school watching as the around movie starts off with a brief explanation about the past history and of then it to the story as told through the eyes of a young a young teacher who does n't take life or the situation too seriously as he and the driver approach a he plays around with his drivers not that this is a serious moment and that 
 this is a love story set against the back drop of television news the three main stars william hurt hunter and albert brooks create a love working at the washington bureau of a tv hurt is the reporter who is being to be a hunter is the producer who that tom lacks the intellectual to be a real journalist but falls for him altman brooks is the man who shares her in standards is also the man who truly hunter 
 most movies about or set in new orleans turn out to be bad and inaccurate remember the but i 'll make an exception for which almost got it right 's one that does n't inevitably get it wrong the are not too bad yes the down here is way more than southern the city of N is shown the way it without the tourist shots and they understand a good drama without trying to make everyone a one of the 
 what a movie the worst of the worst this movie is as entertaining as a dead stupid plot who wrote this script was there ever a script for this movie or did the director just press the on his camera and then decided to make the film up as they went along is this meant to be a kids movie or a comedy or what my friends younger brother is in the grade and him and his just did an 
 it is to typical of people complaining about something when they no nothing about it so this is about a man falling for a straight women first of all this is a true story so you say its not second its written by a man so the whole thing about this being against the are just plain stupid personally i think this was the best love story i 've ever seen and i am very pro i think this shows 
 a very funny look at some of australia 's current affairs and political the boys really seem to have fun with this show and what i enjoy is that they all have their strengths some are brilliant at making complete of themselves can pull off the whole i 'm a famous politician and i 'm about to suggest that he himself as a pot of type of have great segments in the show taking the out of all sorts of 
 what i love about this show is that it follows the lives of modern and it 's a blast to experience their everyday love humor and the literature of magic is so diverse portraying the ideas of classical and modern like harry and with the this show is so fun and unique because it lets us experience a lot of that modern seven seasons worth this show has so many great and it 's a to watch live her daily 
 father is an entertaining tale of an unwilling father who is definitely a patrick plays jack charles who is a always on the for the one big score that is going to put him on easy street his wife died while he was is prison and his two kids were put in foster care when he got out he thought they were probably better off in foster care besides he still had to score his fortune his daughter charles played 
 this movie is simply it is so although the and other are played out the comedy is himself and are there will be moments when you ca n't breath you 're laughing so hard plus there are scenes that you can watch hundreds of times and still this is one of the i 've ever seen 
 if it was n't for the movie would be ready for the dust so so silly and so badly acted only as always through this mess as single light on the end of the tunnel the worst was rubin 's acting for sure maybe it was because of this script did they actually have really written one or was it just made up on the way cut a long story short it is a must see only for like me 
 i 've never read a good review for fair and i ca n't understand why for something that was rushed through in ten days it all comes off surprisingly well though sharp is a better movie and hopkins a better there 's nothing to stop this one from getting a solid at times might seem just too and nice to be playing an but at other times she just has to her eyes and the air drops a dozen degrees 
 there 's an underlying current in all the positive reviews of this movie it 's just a comedy do n't take it seriously well that 's one point of view the other would be why are we accepting exactly the same script the same formula and the same people in all these you get is a who through some totally circumstances has to change his life always a he overcome a set of circumstances which would only pose a problem 
 you 've never seen anything like it once the coup begins it 's the most you 'll ever see even though you know the outcome and it 's all real because it 's a amazing by the time it was over it was on my top N list of all time great the everyone i know who has seen this film gives it the rating even if you do n't care about politics or about politics you will find yourself 
 the van is a simple picture made especially for the drive in that goes out of it 's way to make you feel comfortable providing many opportunities to and cry with your friends danny has a small yet role as the manager of a car wash and almost the show all the leads are well acted the characters complex and the quite competent for this type of picture a crown international release 
 this has got to be one of the best episodes of doctor who that i 've seen since it came back last year there is a brilliant mix of fear and all mixed up which one amazing episode the were designed and i 'm pretty sure there ' going to be a lot of jokes in the next few weeks i myself am guilty of that particularly liked the way that we saw a different perspective of rose 's and 
 what i came away with after watching this movie was a guilty the film itself has a rather intriguing plot line and to it but unfortunately it is a movie that you can not watch with out being with if you plan on this and have a moral problem with the of the act for the pleasure of an audience then you are making a big mistake this is not the type of movie with the sex scene that you 
 barriers seems to be one of those series that have been lost in the of time after it 's transmission in the early and one repeat it 's since without this is a originally watched this when it was in the southern tv region on sunday and was classic although i do n't remember a great deal about the program a few things stuck in my mind most notable were the titles the music accompanying the attempted escape across an 
 it 's not awful but what a waste bad music poor drawings and regarding the impressive number of and on this picture from a hundred different studios throughout the world come on how can you expect something when doing an movie this way i wonder if one guy on the credits one drawing the lines are rough the work inadequate i 'm not against it but not in this film but the backgrounds are the is rather far from the 
 this movie reminded me of the live of the not like the recent which seemed more of a than anything else but a true moral drama that is both engaging and anne is more than credible as the army officer having an affair with her superior played by sam and eric is wonderful as her lawyer defending her against the military establishment i found myself waiting for their affair to begin if only because they look so good together this 
 i loved the book series and each one in middle school and when i heard that there was a television i was very what a let down the final product was i think for me this was the moment when stopped being about cool programming and more what was wrong with the series let me count the ways the characters were in the books the were somewhere between the television cast were at least i remember being when i first 
 considering the risk of showing relationships before the late N 's personal best could have done better to play the relationship between chris and skinner as a more than experimental phase of 's seems to me that the of this movie threw in the relationship between two fairly attractive women in order to attract viewers also consider the N seconds of the of several women jumping over a high jump this random scene had very little to the movie and 
 more that gives new meaning to and will leave you for 's a shame that all the people involved in the making of this movie are now dead or in nursing homes i thought about suing them for as this movie started its aggressive assault onto my poor i felt instant strong pain my entire being that damn can soviet tanks into tiny glass why did n't you switch the channel if you did n't like it you might ask 
 i 've seen worse films this is bad but at least does n't try to be good so it deserves a brief round of applause it rest firmly in the of the is a film but in a nice way and is certainly worth buying if it 's in the bargain at your local supermarket rather than just plain highlight for me is when 's goes to rescue her upon turning up she which draws from his back get drunk 
 i thought who managed to escape from the grave of part one was going to be in part N guess not i just think they should of killed her off like in friday the part N you know what i mean movie like N and urban N followed movies within a was pure the whole movie within a movie stay away 
 one has to take martin & lewis like a of salt & why does martin put up with lewis then again why do all the women in this movie like jerry because he is martin a few good 'd at least once and jerry manages to more than in all his other movies combined i generally find that i can take just so much of jerry 's before they become but in this film watch when jerry gets stuck outside 
 first of all i too was expecting another hero a work of art for the action i 've only seen parts of tiger hidden but i can imagine that it is better than elements from hero are found in great and acting i mean if you ca n't understand a word they are saying without the but you still care that 's good acting what went wrong what begins with political into a love story worse it 's a soap 
 i must have been only N when started it was a must see for the whole family i believe on sun nights were opening his he had to use a or to the right spot on another and do some other things finally the spot his door would open and taking out of a new at the start of an episode he would open up a package with a new dress and for the rest of the show be finding 
 after just N minutes into this film i began to miss 's earlier more films that looked at the politics and society of china from unique his turn to arts films was a serious in my opinion hero was his worst film since operation with a complex story and acting more wooden than that found in a john film is no different as an american who has been studying chinese films for a few years now and understands and can 
 as a recreational with some knowledge of the sport 's history i was pleased with disney 's to the issues of class in golf in the early century the movie well the psychological that harry fought within himself from his of being to his own inability to break that glass ceiling that prevents him from being accepted as an equal in english golf society likewise the young goes through his own class struggles being a mere in the eyes of 
 i love this movie this is definitely added to my list of ' i do n't f ' ii society ' i 'll smoke anybody i just do n't f ' new jersey drive they steal cars in broad they obviously do n't f new jersey drive is the best movie ever it is at the top of the list ii society is second and is third is really for new jersey drive is too mac mall & young lay 
 it 's hard and i did n't expect it but it 's really the worst film me and my wife saw awful that extend through time without any apparent reason except to fill time the does n't follow a comprehensive way everything is a mess the action and the appear at the thing that disappointed me most was to see one of my french favorite actors involved in this i do n't even know how to describe it without being 
 there was a time when not all was disney or its so nice to see this wonderful film again and i actually got hold of a good reasonable copy on be careful as its out of the public and there are some really bad copies got a very good copy by a company called and its quite good in the old days i watched it on black and white on tv and its magic to see it in very much 
 this is really the only chance to see the magic of james 's writing brought to life his novels are all in any real sense and this is the only long story he wrote it was john 's last film and did not reach the screen until after he had died and it is easy to see his touch of the dead is in its approach on the screen telling us more about ireland than any modern movie on the 
 this movie is by far one of my i saw it while in college in the early N 's and while i could n't identify with the in the film i felt that the story characters and movie in general were top to the people who spoke of indian summer feel free to stick to your movies and leave the movies with a great story to those who can appreciate them 
 the and tragedy of the christmas season lies in the fact that it mostly around family that is why some people call it the children 's holiday as we age natural and progress the people and the things that gave us our special memories john denver in one of his roles plays george billings a successful architect and new who lost his wife about a year earlier his life is focused around his N year old daughter alex both are 
 i love this movie even though i rated it a N that 's because the acting the plot and the budget were all slated to the b universe even before this movie was released but that 's ok it is an entertaining film that has a lot to offer i remember what leonard said about plan N from outer space a film so bad that it 's great lacking the ufo plot the thing the could n't die relies on 
 i got to say that is the woman on the planet this movie was and i mean it had all the sex content that most ivan reitman have but with something a extra chemistry and both have this but chemistry that seem to in each scene both seem to create this odd and interesting relationship with powerful sexual tension that you until you ca n't feel your face anymore and the rest of the supporting cast seem to play off 
 what can be said about a movie that makes two hours seem like three weeks the hero starts out in japan goes through an identity crisis saving a makes a to america saving a named sam in a little wild west action saving a native american named goes hunting 's gold and then heads back to japan to fight a war the film obviously has no clue where it 's going at any point in time i think the director 
 N is an entertaining if not an entirely successful one the ultimate challenge is of course worth the price of admission alone but once again as with a lot of the early mania 's there 's too much in between the crowd for almost everything and as always giving us the announcing team of & the body having a face face match as the main event for a was absolutely of at this time it only made things that much 
 many king fans hate this because it from the book but film is a different medium and books should change when they make the jump that notwithstanding the movie does fail completely but it fails entirely on film terms i 'd like to the people who tell me it 's the movie ever made i always follow up with the question really exactly what scene scared you every fan i 've asked goes silent occasionally someone at a loss for 
 the was the most film of the decade despite my best efforts at home it is still seen as a bad movie i say to hell with everyone on this every one does n't understand that it is in part a comedy with a dramatic twist at the end danny plays a out director with and a sad depressed man the scene when he is trying to record a last message is quite good the of stones movie are absolutely 
 ten out of the N short films in this movie are i found only the egyptian one disappointing all but the mexican director chose to the problems of individuals or groups in connection with the afghan refugees people the of aids and poverty and corruption in africa coup and in israel and americans in the usa old people living alone and the aftermath of in the hearts of asian soldiers this might say something sad about the limits of in 
 no plot acting and this is supposed to be a movie there 's no fear or just boom bang then done some are in the desert for some weird reason and they get down by those from the first movie which was good and should have been left it at is just another excuse for money and use of violence just like the saw they know no matter how the plot is and the more they can add people will 
 this film is undoubtedly one of the greatest in history of by seeing this film we can only notice that world in had such a such a strong and adequate use of and almost of ethical choices in human life was then not only one form of arts it was much higher than ordinary life and it gave many people hope to live after the war it is said that even was moved and that such a work of art 
 this movie was funny from start to finish everyone in the was laughing out loud throughout the film the best characters were alex fisher cohen the girl from will and grace and the they had the best lines the best attitudes etc playing a was really funny she really played it well and was very convincing the only bad thing about the film was the fact that the other two main characters were n't as funny even though the movie 
 whether written or generally try to avoid too may characters readers and viewers after all can be too easily by trying to keep track of who exactly is who this is especially true in film i think simply because we can not easily go back to our memory in a viewers like myself however do n't have that problem because we see all our films on or year ago i was introduced to a french actress whom i first saw 
 first of all no one with any law enforcement experience not or but real law enforcement takes this show seriously walker would be out of any police force in the us for his illegal and totally tactics on top of that he is a comic book character acting ability lines no character development the fact that alex him shows just how really are and is the ultimate in come on you think walker is a show without bias then explain 
 in the future a group of people aboard a commercial is forced to their survival when the on a planet they already have one problem in that one of the passengers is intense criminal richard diesel in his first role however they are soon upon by a strange of that in the and a rare solar is soon to take the script for this movie is ultimately on the routine side it is acted and it is especially technically location 
 i was going to give it an N but since you people made out of a lot better votes i had to up my contribution the river was pure sure was his stuff but at least his role was appropriate the first half hour was really and then the rest of the movie was easy to watch the was enough and 's card at the parties along with the reaction from the upper were fun to watch this was much 
 i caught this movie on and i enjoyed it although i felt like the job was a little rough though it may have been i had a little bit of a hard time figuring out what was going on at first because they seemed to be going for a little bit of a pulp plot presentation it seemed a little forced though i certainly think that the movie is worth watching but i think it could have used a little 
 i should have known when i heard anne rice left the project that the movie would me i could n't have predicted that years after it 's release just thinking about the movie still makes me angry the novels are amazing and while i understand much gets lost in the translation to screen this movie was a great big middle finger to her original work i hope one day someone tries again the right way starting with the they change 
 a weird and wonderful of family life writer andrew marshall has written something that is funny and occasionally yes do n't be by children 's tune and characters the show has a dark side and at times can be quite and that 's what 's so good about the show it 's not just a where every character is a comic device the case with my family instead the characters are fully individuals that show the full roller-coaster of human 
 movie N is the most recent in the long line over movie movies which i so much i wish this movie could be the death of the but i know that it is n't awful enough to put the final in the meet the is considered the bottom of the barrel as far as hollywood movies go than movie is probably near the top unfortunately meet the was actually miles below the barrel and this movie just barely makes it 
 wait wait wait wait wait wait what this movie is terrible absolutely terrible the only reason is on the cover is to sell it to fans only to have their hearts broken he one guy gets shot and dies before half the movie is over not to mention he was only in the first N and then disappeared until the point which he died why put him on the cover if his character where are the battle scenes promised in 
 beginning where it left off doctor who rose her alternative his alternative counterpart and 's small gang of rebels find themselves at the of this realities version of the this second part of the N episode feels more like a doctor who episode as opposed to the previous part which felt like more of an episode of the show which granted was a great show in it 's own right the as a whole was enough as i 'm one 
 i was looking through tv guide last night and saw a movie on who i liked in movies like nights and austin powers so i decided to watch it it started out ok but you could tell the story was lacking and at about half way through it started to i do not remember this movie being in the theaters and i 'm sure if it was it was n't there long the acting was and the dialogue was silly 
 i have seen a lot of movies in fact i love b movies they are one of my favorite however this garbage i refuse to acknowledge that this was given the honor of film was the worst piece of i have ever had the of watching i actually signed up on for the fact that i needed a way to at least voice how awful this garbage was i have watched films they at least deserve the honor done in 
 no i have not seen the original series and i wo n't compare the two if i had this series is in canada in vancouver and british columbia the series is in a different story each week some are little out there but most of the time it is the quality of the story telling i loved the episode with brown and barbara and the episode with the as a in a world where humans have become to a it 
 with such actors as ralph raymond and scott how can you go wrong very unusual especially the modern ones the of the modern machinery is very effective here you have from building vehicles that help clear the area so new structures can be made although she 's much younger in this film it 's not very hard to figure out who the future mrs. from the series all creatures great and small is going to be really effective of both 
 i missed the beginning of the film i came in when the 's were in the farm house i can say that it was the moral are staggering my fear of pain and leave me unable to see myself other than i see the like ability that was by the and i can only that i could or would have the moral to follow his see that a main theme of the film is to show the of the but 
 the music is by and not by stupid incompetent philip glass and was written ten years before glass ' unfortunate birth the staging is simply extraordinary the in japanese adds a threatening quality and intensity that the latin version does not have 's version the giant heads and hands are totally justified by the aspect of the tale the and make up used for the are simply spot on it 's 's best work the are very good especially is 
 movies are something you see on saturday night and forget by sunday morning motion pictures are works of art that stick with you forever falls into the latter category this is the type of thing that should win academy a brilliant of film that is both and instead of doing a look at the life of director paul three of the author 's stories into a look at his past and final day on earth the day he tried to 
 i would most definitely have to say that this is the most terrible movie i have ever seen it 's not just the actors that are bad but also the fact that the camera person taped the wall and the for about N minutes at a time anyone that likes this must be crazy this movie is a waste of time

 when it comes to movies i am more than willing to suspend ignore production values and plot in the interest of a good scare this movies simply has no good to offer it ca n't even be enjoyed as camp bad dialogue bad acting bad direction the were predictable and poorly staged the music was the camera work was even the were bad i felt really bad for the actors who were obviously trying but who had to deal with 
 this movie is so it is not even funny if you think of seeing this one for the stay clear this one deals with the effects and that the must endure even the are seeking the answer we all do why acting from the two leading as we see how those we ignore are affected by the very same things we are affected with yes the language is harsh at times but it suits the characters well there are some 
 i loved this well i loved the part with and the girl her name i was only interested in those too i loved them in the movie i want to see more movies like that but please no more sad where they be it made me cry but the between them the plot the everything was great i just was more into and everything about this movie was the kind to keep you to your seat because i sure was

 welcome to the plan N from outer space of star movies come on admit it this movie is so bad so in every department it 's become something of a gives the worst performance ever committed to brilliant this is n't just it 's several large farms in kentucky the special effects should be done under the trade act for using such a term the enterprise is a moving piece of in this film really even the star tv show 
 an object lesson in how to make a bad movie which as without going in too close i would imagine this is the results of a bunch of film school students all adding to the story and then actually acting in it its like a film of some kind and its a film badly in need of an which case it would have lasted N minutes the director of this garbage probably had more money than sense consider the number 
 unlike the many who have posted here i 'm not movie i across this movie by accident channel and could n't away this is a truly incredible movie worthy of all the the critics and those on this site have on it the actors are is beautiful and innocent her is sweet and you could n't help but feel ' father 's and as he his son for such as to serve in the great have the movie so well

 this movie was supposed to have a 's man ' who was ready and willing to settle down once and for all however i did not care for his mission to settle down because i did n't care for his character i do n't understand what all of these beautiful women saw in him he had absolutely no class or he should 've at least had a way about himself that made weak in the other than his playing but 
 i did n't know the real events when i sat down to watch this just the fact that this was based upon a true story after the death of the kid 's father tries to help her daughter i did not know anyone actually named their that cope with the loss this is really made for children as is often the case with family with that said go ahead and get everyone together for a though i 'd keep out 
 i 'm not going to say too much as this movie is n't worth the effort to put it simply the movie absolutely this is the worst movie i have ever seen the was stupid you could n't follow what was happening the characters were so especially the main guy i wanted someone to kill that kid and put him and the movie out of it 's very bad 
 this is not a good film the acting is stiff and film does n't seem to know whether it is going for a real approach or to go down the camp and route i never saw the first film but this one does n't stand up on its own merits there are several plot and the is never made aware of the importance of the lead female not worth the effort of watching 
 the whole exercise is why make the film at all the lighting is but the sound is just a joke like a high-school production whoever put the budget together for this film should be drawn and for allowing it to be made without the proper budget for with equipment fit for much is due to losses in echo or the lack of to the economy should have been made on any other area the whole production is and just with

 this movie is such a total waste of time i ca n't understand anyone sitting through this piece of trash oh i would have loved it when i was seven years old i think a seven year old child may have written and directed 's no script no acting just the best acting is that by the fighting i think i could whip these and i am not someone you 'd consider tough totally and did not spark the least 
 considered by almost all the critics to be the best of the films i have no argument with that although there are a couple of others i thought just as entertaining one thing it 's the longest of the series that i 've seen at N minutes i 've only seen six of them but this was longer than i 'm used to and with the action i thought the whole thing was a bit too it is a good 
 i first read about N years ago and absolutely loved it it is a classic historical set in the when the west country was several days ' from london and law and order was much harder to enforce this version of the book takes several with the story and was disappointing in my opinion the acting and production values are ok but the way the story was about with was why do television do this why would they think that 
 i was actually looking forward to this movie the commercials made it look real cool and action packed and i heard that ' character was arrested for assault so i thought that maybe she would kick a lot of and that would be cool but their was hardly any action at all and the character were all the only saving grace was and even he did n't help this movie much 
 i thought this was a really great movie especially since it was for me i was i got it from the library and i really enjoyed myself i 've watched it twice in the two days and the more i watch it the more i like thought that the plot was going to be really but in the end it really could be said that it would be true i liked the main characters and i thought that they were

 ' is a observed portrait of the of a young french homosexual both and it 's a film acted shot with a feel for the town where the action takes place never but often painfully real if anything it 's almost too realistic as there 's little in the way of conventional plot just scenes from a life but the absence of conventional dramatic tension counts for less than it might in a world so drawn ' might not be

 i watched part of the first part of this movie and tiny little of other parts maybe i 'm but i do n't think this movie is really worth watching the odd characters and does catch your attention and is rather interesting but there are bad things in it as well and some gross things the magic and side of it turned me off and for most this movie would not be very suitable or to watch

 pretty good does n't rent me but i was surprised at how much i enjoyed while by no means a classic the directors involved do have an idea what is the do n't just jump out at you but instead the directors build steadily to the moments the film is based upon popular urban and ghost stories the writers have the rather well and them just enough that the familiar still pack a the best of the are the and

 is an based on the examples from late century police the twist here is that is literally a walking cheap of the show its and hidden that is not to say that is of jokes just that the toilet humor is used enough to consistent not and the title of the program demonstrates the humor used throughout the consists of photos of the city set to a theme in one photo a police is shown and the camera in on

 this film really misses the mark on most fronts the are weak the acting and the comedy weak at 've got a great idea it could have been particularly but for the reasons mentioned writer seems to think by putting the word f into every sentence it 'll make it and the main character just seems to try a little too hard he 's no brick top for time at least get a cast that can keep the for the

 today being president 's day my wife and i had the notebook out at our local library it 's a movie released in N that fell beneath our radar as we are big movie i 'm a published author with hopes of screen playing my first book i 'd noticed to the notebook in reviews of other movies which is why i brought it up about us watching and this morning provided the perfect opportunity we both really liked it 
 with a relatively small budget for an film of only $ N million the people at fox and blue sky studios have done an incredible have combined digital the perfectly cast voice of ray john and dennis among many others to create a highly entertaining family film with a strong message about cooperation friendship and for your fellow members and how sometimes it takes many different creatures to make up a watching this film i got a strong political message

 this show is done when it first came out i though it nothing more than a family comedy with quite a few good it seemed to express many families really well too with different of both parent and child however like i said i never thought any more of it then a good watch on an evening however my view was shot out the other window when the death of the funny john accrued the stood it 's ground and 
 the movie that scenes of a no one from this movie except for michael who out extreme pain as in five the hard way he 's the really who i did when he practices on our doctor probably the most you will have is with dr.

 i just recently watched ed wood jr. 's movie or for the first time after having heard so much about it for so many years nothing i had read or heard about this film could prepare me for what i saw this has to be the most bizarre movie ever made women in around and only as he can pull the string pull the string it was totally the acting was and the was exactly what one would expect from 
 this movie is a joke and must be one of the worst movies ever made this is a typical movie where you have one man destroying the whole army by himself first blood N is very similar to 's but there you have arnold killing the terrorist while here you have a specific nation showed as the bad guys this movie is a typical american propaganda true this was the peak of the cold war but i 'm sick of 
 i was looking forward to seeing this movie after reading a positive review in the new york times in addition i 'm also so there was more than just a passing interest in the subject matter however after watching it i was extremely movie 's pace was slow and the director on certain scenes for much too long there was no passion or chemistry between the there was barely any dialogue dialogue was needed to compensate for the lack of

 the original series of novels is a classic of the it 's pure with some substance here and there and i 've always why hollywood has n't it because it 's just the kind of thing they love massive explosions hero gets the girl aliens great potential good evil in the form etc etc instead and bear in mind i 'm a and we get this movie that the out of the story in ironic as the latter off the 
 given the acting roles he played in the mr. peters jerome k. count it surprises many of his fans to learn that originally made a name for himself in in the west end and broadway he was usually such a total or serious actor to the public that his comic were ignored in fact he actually did make four comedy appearances one a of his with his partner peter in a appearance his best total film appearance in a comedy 
 the went well out of their way to find only the following that have the appearance of good will particularly older women and families with children who are especially by the security and that do n't believe in the security heavily with its alleged effect on and consider it divisive a waste of money oh yes they do put in one member of the israeli government that does support the but they do what they can to him as and

 although this starts out a woman in a car is around dark roads in the middle of the night in the middle of the forest until she almost hits a man holding a this gave me the impression that we were going to see something special something almost david if there is such a term but unfortunately the film starts to go not having a core center just sort of story about a woman trying to solve a mystery of 
 east palace west palace reminded me somewhat of the with frank in the role of the and william is the boy it 's a film for china i guess but it also about the of men much is made of chinese in which men take on female roles the movie focuses on an man who wants desperately to be dominated and hurt by a guy he the park without fear he hopes to be taken into the by the officer 
 i had been looking for this film for so long before i found it i had seen it when i was younger and loved it after my second i still loved it and i still is a film if you like bottom young ones the comic strip then you will find this funny if you do n't like that kind of then do n't bother i love this film and have grown up with these comedy for me this film 
 i could n't help but the entire of cat in the brain because it explains a director 's steadily going mad seeing people murdered from past movies he has made even mundane activities such as cooking a in the microwave or running a of water yield some from a film in the past director playing himself is ghosts of and can not seem to his mental well being from constant murder he seeks help from a who instead uses 's 
 it 's painfully clear that all effort in this film was directed toward and very little attention to everything else most obvious mistake is the of the entire female cast many of them are very experienced and capable but they all seemed out of place and having an director certainly did n't help the story is a very common story and characters behaved very thus making it extremely difficult for me to with the this movie 's theme is modern 
 nobody truly understands the logic behind the of italian but why would we bother every single film in the series great fun nasty and shocks and N is no exception to this despite all the production difficulties that occurred shooting this film began as an interesting project who had to elaborate further on his N success but it ended up being a typical bruno product with more flaws and stolen ideas from previous films the is and all forms of

 i mention that there may be a here just to be cautious because of what i discuss although i do n't really think i am giving away anything important any are really to this film 's success or a 's ability to enjoy it while not without some very minor flaws this is a beautiful and very moving film about friendship time uncertainty and the choices people make about their lives yet at the same time it is also a 
 mexican ' was the third entry in the series as you will soon find out this movie is anything but a classic instead it 's more like a movie that deliberately tries to scientist wants to steal from a but that is that walking toilet paper commercial the knowing he ca n't beat the he then builds a robot and a very bad one at that we only get to see in the last as he around and does battle 
 the most movie of all time not to mention by should n't they have moved beyond white people in brown face playing the indians my favorite parts though have to be when the and as the bikers drag them off to gang rape them rape is fun who knew let 's see then there 's the of the fat boss character actually plays pool while to destroy the indians with the lead rebel the acting the music the lack of

 my mom and i have just recently become to this show laughing our off i 've only seen about N episodes and i am disappointed that i did n't pay attention to this series before they were canceled the story line is very funny the characters really have great or not so great but they 're still funny i every episode of what i like about you and as well as all of the cast never leave me while watching 
 the future as seen from N england as war over europe the of will not be found in the politics of the past it is up to the new world of science to overcome man 's past in to the your leaders and what you are told thinking outside the box can lead to a tomorrow there will always be and fear and learning to overcome it is our only and i had seen this film long ago and recently 
 this movie had potential to be a good little high school instead we got a about a the problem was there were too many unnecessary things a fight with the random friends coming over to be killed it was obvious they were just killing time the main character was and bell had no during this movie she was just there another problem was the fact that the killer was not a threat the children survive so it 's obvious they 
 this movie is pretty predictable said from the delayed scene to the inevitable coming around of this is a great movie for the age group but beyond that it has no market i give it only because it achieved exactly what it set out to do and nothing more 
 quite a lot has been said about this film and its landmark importance in forming the language of film if you are interested in film history to truly understand the brings to the medium you might try along side most any film made before it those of offer a good contrast it should be allowed that was not the only and the principles of would likely have been discovered by another given time however even today few directors have approached 
 direction leaves a decent cast in a but in which dialogue seems rather than and cash strapped appearances by the ghosts fail to round up any sense of or magic edward as the ghost of christmas present around on and seems to be doing an impression of bernard as george c. scott is too and he never seems to truly believe in it which his performance of its effect the scenes in which he 's shown his past have as 
 the acting was horrible the special effects while dominated the movie the writing was and the dialogue was and the silly little love story between tyler and ben was out of the worst of was the total lack of scientific reality the is the size of texas says bob that 's N miles wide no one in nasa even sees the until a midday havoc in new york nasa a drilling team to join the and trains them in a 
 i watched this movie N years ago in company with my best female friend i got my judgment teeth pulled out so i did n't feel very ended up it big time it 's a hard watch if you take in account that it deals with friendship unwanted power money drug traffic and the extreme hard situation that deals with living in a foreign acting is on it 's prime level two of the women that i the most star 
 it you in the there are other films with more convincing characters a more realistic story and maybe even more concerning political but then again most of these are not directed by peter maybe the one true artist of british film to emerge out of the has made quite a bunch of rarely seen films that perfectly capture the spirit of the world the world of political social problems and solutions thus his work is probably less than say political 
 in an industry dominated by men and in lack of products with a female mark on it is it always nice to see a film shown from the woman 's point of view i would welcome more films from female writers and directors and i think lots of other women with me 
 i admit that i almost gave up on watching tv shows why because most of them are about doctors or some who can predict a murder by sitting on the toilet seat but i must say i was wrong when i watched the first episode of one of the most brilliant shows on tv until today is a show about maximum secure prison and shows episodes in life of every cell inside the prison and their what i like about

 the man in the moon is a pretty good movie it is very at times and is very well done in all i would n't say the film was original but what is these days the cast members all did a great job with their respective roles i really enjoyed seeing at such a young age and does quite a good job london does a fine job as well and the only other person i recognized was sam who did 
 i have watched this movie on a couple of times now the first time i watched the second half after the hour and then went back to the first hour an entertaining film god no in it and it gives us all a genuine insight into the difficult life of queen and the difficult choices she had to make nothing bad about the movie at all no real bad language or anything of a sexual nature which would for family

 this one surprised read a few reviews that called it a good movie and was prepared for the worst through it i suddenly i was completely up in it and enjoying it a lot there were some really moments that had you sitting forward nervously with the control or any other object in reach overall this movie definitely does n't deserve the must be given to director gary ellis and writers bill & king for their movie debut i hope

 i find this movie the best movie i have ever seen because it reflects the inner strength of a young girl during the second world war the movie is impressive not least because it actually happened it me of the story of anne frank 
 let me say first off i did n't go in expecting much and watching it at prime-time on opening night should have helped i believe it would have had there been more than N people in the theater it so hard the acting was at best and nothing was really explained until the last N minutes of the movie i guess that was their way of the plot keep everyone in the dark on crucial to understand the movies direction

 i guess this is the first movie that made me aware of the term it is totally a bad movie but i ca n't help it i like this movie richard boone has made better and so has joan van but if you are in to staying up late and watching movies that do n't make you think to much this one is for you 
 my bush is first of all a very entertaining show by parker and stone i thought its often very very funny and its quite and crazy south park fans would surely get something here another surprise is the production value here a lot of money must have been put into this and it shows a lot of expensive little details its not a little show and comedy central is not an extremely rich channel but they put a lot into 
 this movie is a bad attempt to make original fans feel complete the one thing people have forgotten is the fact that the reason the original won such was strictly do to the fact that it was supposed to make you feel movie makes me want to go to the i am not a negative type of guy but man the acting in this is no comment the plot was a bad reflection of the life of and i am 
 this is a below average arts films which is worth watching for the comedy value due to the part where a pair of are used as weapons it really there is much to say about this film it lacks in every department because the arts are not that great either and with all movies of this type the as bad 
 i ca n't agree with any of the comments first time i saw the film on a tv channel it was presented as an film and if you take the film under this i think it 's an all different matter i could n't believe what i was seeing and got instantly the plot may be as bad as a 's show there is no plot but the acting is it 's and it 's all in all an incredible 
 surface from the day its first showed in the summer of N was a on one hand it seemed so and plot driven that to the it felt like it would work out better as a motion picture or several plus it felt like it was nbc 's attempt at a on the other hand one may have realized that the story was too to tell in a movie or two and fans of lost seemed after one and possibly 
 every once in a while a film comes along with characters we all know and love a film where you see people you know portrayed on screen it 's very at its blues is that film set in new york the story a solid woman who is the foundation for her community this based on a true story film is told from a child she accepted as her own this child wrote the winner s. stars as a woman who 
 having read the book prior to watching this you would think that it would have lost some of its however the story is so i could never tire of it and really put their hearts into their roles and brought out so much of the characters i fell in love with the story and the women all over to watch thanks to direction and despite the plot speed of television i do n't feel that anything important was lost in 
 i the version of and i appreciate 's version if only for the growing interest in the book wish i find more of a mystery slash with the romantic aspects i do n't approve of the fact that andrew lloyd made the relationship between and less since this is a short with only and this version does n't even have to bother with any other thought i would still be waiting for another version to match up 's performance i 
 normally i try to avoid films but this one was to the graphics and character voice it all well this tale is a great spin off of others but is well worth buying i do n't have kids but the kids i including boys find it intriguing and love the extra features on the i do n't know why this is rated so low but for kids especially your ' N year old will love this its not straight forward

 i loved this movie i totally disagree with some negative that i 've read over the years this was a great vehicle for eddie murphy he appeared to have a great time with his part as chandler and he should never care about what the critics say if he had fun doing it and most of his audience enjoyed it and it was fun to watch as it combined some great fantasy tension with mr. murphy 's great style you 
 the is an occasionally entertaining film most of this entertainment is from laughing at the film it is extremely and includes many elements take for instance the switch between black & white and color if done right this could of been fairly effective but because it was done poorly it turned into a and only from the already bad experience much of the film had an odd feel to it the acting was n't extremely bad for a made for 
 i just saw this movie and it turns out to be pretty just as mentioned by other user reviews and the one thing that bothered me the most was the southern some of the characters had it took place in wisconsin not the south as mentioned from other reviews ed was n't a big so why did the guy that plays and him i fast through most of it being that there are many slow parts hopefully someone will do

 there is only one joke in this duck short which is basically when black beauty it is a black woman i can understand partly why this joke was included as at the time few people did not know how it was to be and it was n't even illegal to black people from this point a is basically a fun interesting short where meets characters in books and does things in books i liked this short quite a lot despite 
 i understand that the budget was low on this film but come on this is really terrible the script is just plain awful and that was the free part the effects are n't bad but this film plays out like a conventional movie with and violence rather than a no holds barred that was intentionally made for video who were these guys like this would have been released in acting is terrible the another free aspect of the film is 
 as a man now living in sweden i must i often watch movies most if them i never understand i think actors from work best in hollywood last week i watched a film called the polish together with a polish friend of mine and we both said it was the worst movie we ever watched unfortunately i was wrong this movie house of angels is even worse none of the actors can act absolutely not the female so called star 
 i saw this film first in the soviet union and many scenes were simply out by the censorship committee but then in poland in N i watched it in a complete form and so what the plot is N men survive the genetic catastrophe and find themselves on the planet full of strong straight and fundamentally severe the men now try to fight it and then the whole bunch of extremely silly follow constant desire for sex who are shown 
 does anyone think that this show actually helps some people or does it only anger the people who watch it when i am through the channels and come upon this show i half to watch out of i understand that pat is not all together what i do not know is if his viewers are like him or if they are good people and think they will have a better life if they listening to what he has to say 
 christopher must have been taught by a awful because he just ca n't let go of the concept the play sister mary explains it all for you was presented at least in hollywood in precisely the same tone as 's scenes here sister mary was an a a bitter of a confident and highly and as played by lynn she was but the movie insists that we take this absolutely seriously while as mentioned maintaining the same tone in the 
 this movie was like the disney channel after dark take out the are n't we language and themes and you are left with dialogue and plot devices that the intelligence of anyone who does n't describe saved by the bell as quality television the dialogue so and one might think the was the product of and joe in a room with orders to produce an of every bad script each had ever had a hand in creating if that was 
 a fine story about following your dreams and actually taking a at doing something about them when the chance strikes nothing was easy for morris had a family job job a mortgage was n't like he could just drop what he was doing and on the to play ball for N months it took i am glad that they showed his almost up he got the to the can remember seeing him pitch against the red i think it was

 no not really but this is a very good film indeed and is a forgotten black and white suits the forward formula a guy had the and the authorities have to track down everyone he came in contact with before they well directed and the acting is great richard as the male lead is good but is completely over in the acting stakes by paul douglas as the police and jack never better than this and zero as the went 
 i do n't remember ever seeing this one before tonight probably the title sounded so ordinary it kept passing me by but it is a well b western with an by acting from the good to into wide open town looking for his wife and news of their daughter and stays for a time as as usual the good business folk have mixed they want to get rid of the but like the business they bring it still applies relax 
 i went to the movie theater this afternoon expecting to be by the film exceeded expectations at least a little bit it 's nothing heavy nothing deep and not anywhere as good as any number of real allen but it 's also completely as a light comedy there 's something kind of simple and sweet about it was the word i heard from people in the audience as they were walking out after the show it does n't feel like 
 my dinner with is a at howard 's and ride to fame with his N 's band the the were kind of a ' act during the but the film clearly demonstrates that they could eat drink and party with the of culture and not only that they had the musical to back it up many of the acts of the era are seen as they with the band at work and at play this provides my only complaint about 
 this movie at the box office and in the voting here but i loved it one measure of a movie 's worth is how much of it you can still remember after N years i wo n't you with a list but there are dozens of deeply comic scenes also a good story and great casting the are a see it and judge if it ever gets on 
 set in japan is the story of taking over the earth the is far more complicated but the should not be forgotten japan is in turmoil with human form the generally speaking look and act like humans but are evil the japanese word they use is not just but rather the classical form of ' which is a of some historic we 're talking about creatures that would appear more like than simple in human form all that remains is 
 i remember this movie with feelings of sheer more than half of the film is commercials no really the slight excuse for a story could easily have been told in N minutes and almost is the end result is a love story of predictable all obviously thrown together in a commercial attempt to a few more from the contemporary boone hit that 's how fast it was produced the song that inspired it was still big on the charts when 
 i was to know how critics responded to this film so i went to and was to discover that the gallery that is our nation 's film critics had given the film an average N or i can say is if this movie does n't move you you have no heart it 's interesting to note that the same film on the same got a N rating from viewers that the opinion of critics is all that important to me 
 i loved the episode but seems to me there should have been some quick reference to the secretary getting for effectively being an after the fact while i like when a episode of has an twist like this one its resolution should be part of the conclusion of the episode along with the of the between peter and ruth gordon is at one point gordon playing a famous writer makes some comment about being by the famous making a to 
 even years later mission stands out as the worst movie i ever managed to sit through enter a scene fire their guns with wild abandon and then leave how will we find those silent just follow the shell and smoke painfully bad or was it brilliant and just poorly translated not an asian in sight in the cast and a total of N among the crew the plot is ridiculous the acting pretty much then again ca n't act save 
 i thought this was one of those really great films to see with a bunch of close friends i and and and at the same time it was just really although not a new concept this was a very well made film 
 terrible i do n't want to be too negative but this film has an of stupid a just could n't believe how bad this movie are just very strange and off topic the camera work at times just horrible the music at times like a for lawrence of arabia i just watched this film to see how much worse it can of the side kick actors are total but all my and and anything that can hang on my body 
 ironically for a play unavailable on film or video for so long arms and the man has remained fairly constantly available on stage over the years since its debut in N in no small part because it has aged so well as a solid on the nature of and the business of war whenever the world into arms and the man seems to soar as ever more timely and is the play which converted leaving out most of shaw 's 
 this movie has it all action fighting bull riding music pretty this movie is an look at middle america believe me i was there in lots of oil money lots of women and lots of too bad they are all gone now the movie is essentially just another boy meets girl boy loses girl boy gets girl back but it is redeemed by the actors and the music there is absolutely no movie with any better music that this movie 
 but probably not the game is called kong but kong is not even in is gone the kong country was one of my two all time games the other being mario world the kong at least had kong and good levels although it felt more like a game based on at this one is the worst of the lot it does not have the feel original or the enemy 's look stupid and the levels worse it does not look

 this movie without doubt is the best i have seen and really shows what british talent can do it 's effects are good considering the movie is set in the century and all the and of england at the time is captured very well the character 's are developed and out from 's to his development into and ' contrast well with robert who 's and show that you can love a thief and a criminal i quote 's got 
 cuban blood is one of those films that has a lot to say about life in a very traditional way i actually watched it while sailing around cuba on a western caribbean cruise it details the life of an N year old boy in a small town in cuba in N and N during the revolution not much time is spent on the revolution until the very end when the socialist regime came and took the property of the boy 
 this film concerns a very young girl who leaves her family and heads off to become a college freshman one night and her friends decide to go to a wild party with plenty of drinking and and is riding with her who she likes but never told him she loved him as was driving a car was stopped in the middle of the road and she was unable to avoid an accident and as a result there is a bloody 
 the movie begins almost slowly a that seems to off course all part of the plan then roughly one hour into this movie is the it 's worth paying attention to that first hour the is still but suddenly the withdrawn and slightly characters come to life and everyone you and the characters leave feeling by the will love this of all sorts will enjoy the faith demonstrated by the characters not my favorite movie of all time no or 
 the name of bad company 's greatest hits is called N from N you could have just turned up this and cut the sound on this movie most of the played in the movie were from this i guess during the were probably tired of all the period pieces made then about the and that 's how i feel about movies made about the the characters in the movie looked like they were for danny why is it that movies 
 fourth part massacre film concerns a group of in a in the snow being by a killer typical elements for fans female no plot though it wears out its welcome eventually even at its short star stevens makes a which only seems to be there for the of including her in the movie 
 i have n't seen this & do n't plan to see this movie or any other that includes unless & until poor little rich girl out her life for a N year period beginning with her most recent arrest in july fact i do n't know anyone that has gone to see any of 's recent movies i rather imagine N will be the high water mark in her movie making career until she up her act all of the 
 N out of N people found this comment useful and counting people are such for image and looks as much as for the that behind communism 's and looks have as much to do with his as the that has been spread by leftist propaganda such as this movie about do n't know what 's worse being captured by one of 's or having to sit through N hours of this typically garbage the question is n't why this was 
 i say because this does n't deserve the movie and certainly not film i regret paying for the rental and although i 've never walked out on a movie before this would have been it had i seen it in a theatre a society living underground in the future that 's original lots of burning barrel light through windows an woman and her son the list goes on and on c. thomas affects the voice of the you know like 
 i think this is a lovely family movie there are plenty of scenes and moments to be had throughout the movie the actors are great and the effects well executed throughout danny plays george who manages the terrible baseball team angels ' and is great throughout the film also are the young actors joseph and milton davis jr. christopher lloyd is good as al ' and the effects are great in this top disney movie a and movie which everyone 
 what an awful movie the idea of robots fighting each other is cool but the is ridiculous real human action acting and special effects on which this type of movie must depend are i thought it must have been made around and was to see it was from that 's N years after aliens ok lots of people said it was good considering the low budget but i just think 's the point ' it looks totally i would n't 
 damn it the will admit the truth i ' like this cheap N 's the idea that vast of killer are destroying the us is a great idea and in spite of itself the does provide some decent the sight of running away from large obviously fake this film along with the kentucky fried is one of the earlier attempts at which became so popular in the N 's & N 's thanks largely to this one like is pretty 
 by now you 've probably heard a bit about the new disney of 's classic film castle in the sky during late summer of N disney released 's delivery service on video which included a of the saying it was due out in N it 's obviously way past that year now but the has been finally completed and it 's not castle in the sky just castle in the sky for the since is not such a nice word 
 in a far away is a planet called it 's native people but the dog people wage war upon these people and they have no choice but to go to earth and people up for food this is one of the f # k ideas for a movie i 've seen leave it to ted to make a movie more incompetent than the already low standard he set in previous films it 's like he enjoying playing in a game 
 wonderful and live action make this a classic of a classic tale a nice british feel which sets it apart and above from the standard sweet disney 
 i saw this movie a million years N years to be exact ago for the first the time in the light of recent events with the australian woman being in indonesia for so called pot i decided to watch this movie again i to cry my heart out i 'm for hot in need just read my review of of show ' some escaped my eyes but it were hardly filled with why not because the two were n't utterly 
 i saw a for this on the collection of movie for movies featuring it looked like what it is a highly comedy in which an black man that his son is it would seem that 's wife has left him for his brother who works with him at the store back in phoenix he has taken the bus to visit his son norman is los as norman wearing nothing but gets out of his to answer the door trying to 
 i have just seen today you die it is bad almost very the direction and are awful just awful almost made me turn off the movie the director has no idea what he is doing he seems to be things at random and some scenes do n't make sense at all also i hate it when the same scene is used again in the same movie in this movie some scenes were used N or N times pretty the dialogue 
 since many other users have already explained and the i wo n't do i 'd like to that 's interpretation is as also are those of the other actors and in this film reading the previous comments i 've noticed that some people the fact that the film does n't show points of view opposed to and that those little present are in my honest opinion this is far from are many characters that move in a gray zone between 
 was this the greatest movie that i have ever seen no was it the worst a mother of four kids it is nice to watch something that was light and amusing it was great but it was think that it definitely had some room to improve but it am not sure if this movie deserves the extreme level of abuse from the other they obviously do not care for i think that she was better in this than in the 
 this movie was fun especially if your between N and and make a team of getting back at an adult who really deserves it paul makes a great adult who you really want to ' my N year old daughter and her friend loved it parents no really bad words or any sex to worry about recommend it for the ' crowd 
 it is extremely rare that i see a movie from N that i do n't love i dig it all the most robert is a director who has done plenty of excellent work and most of this cast has fine performances under their belt so what went wrong when i used to work in the independent film world we used to talk about something called actors ' movies actors ' movies are movies that are to anyone but other actors 
 man i loved ocean 's movie all characters were crucial to the as each had their own that was necessary to pull of the grand on earth was N what was the purpose of the person i assume it 's supposed to be but she was n't really a part of the N as she was trying to trip them up and working against them the whole film it was more like the story of and ' characters boring relationship 
 as an native of this film has obvious appeal for me the location shots are and show a very much in transition there are a number of scenes of apparent but this serves to show the town being and the idea that the old must make way for the new is right at the heart of this film a slightly james mason leads an in a story about a over a that into a conflict then a resolution though i 
 i was n't expecting much and to be honest i did n't like this film the first time around but watching it again and i that it 's cool sure it 's a one joke film but it 's a funny someone posted that it could be better written and it could be i think this film had the potential to be a my but with a host instead of a lawyer it 's a wasted opportunity with just a 
 i could n't even sit through the whole thing this movie was a piece of i had more fun watching ' tell mom the 's dead it was just too painful to watch say besides austin powers has tom arnold ever been in a hit movie 
 for me a film is one that never dies in my memory and yet can be watched over and over again with the same pleasure as the first time this could be a technically flawed movie the pleasure has nothing to do with my personal is to say the least john carpenter 's the thing is one of very few films to fit this 've been a science fan since i was a child in the and i read the 
 half past dead steven in the main role was a major half past dead N is just a an action movie with nothing lose but with no capacity to win something it 's less entertaining than the first one in all aspects but it 's although worthy a look if you like action movies or just something to watch during a session if you also like to watch former stars on screen or even if you love to watch even 
 this is one of the worst movies i 've ever encountered but i want to say that some of the criticisms i had heard turned out to be unwarranted as far as pure technique goes this director is competent he 's held back by the limited budget and the camera but the actual camera camera movements and scene staging are pretty professional i 've seen many movies where the was much worse at least the scenes flow in a way 
 you can only describe this with one word and that would be i really did not think piece of like this could ever be released if you watch a movie titled then you expect to see at least some cool artists right however none of these guys know any arts and it seems like they went to china and picked the first people they saw on the street and trained them for a day in arts that 's the level 
 i 'm somewhat of a fan of 's work so i was excited when i found this unfortunately i was very let down it 's a series of short which attempt to show a disturbing and sort of humor the is very crude no doubt done using each has a big fat guy beating up his family and generally acting like a to everyone he knows for people who are not familiar with this of they will probably be somewhat 
 i had to do a search on the to find the board of this film because the title is now an unexpected love it 's not really worth looking for but i was with both leads and why they were a on lifetime everything 's pretty and you do n't really get an idea of who these characters are so as a i was n't able to become invested in the i guess i 'm not the target audience for 
 i loved this film it manages to make the characters sympathetic well most of them concerning the problems they have with their as is in a dusty marriage with a husband who barely her presence though he does notice her absence the film shows very well why she is tired of married life and why she is susceptible to a con man without making her or demanding the reaction shots of at the dinner table on her anniversary while her

 there is a story possibly about an exchange between bruce and terry at the start of twelve allegedly produced a long list think about the aircraft one from the fifth element and handed it to bruce it was entitled things bruce does when he acts it ended with a simple message saying please do n't do any of the above in my movie is a fact about this movie definitely true did n't have a hand in the would contend 
 riding giants is an incredible detailing the history and stories of three influential jeff clark and hamilton did an amazing job taking on the role of director and should be for doing such a brilliant job the structure of the film is and works perfectly with the interviews and the music just adds to the overall satisfaction of watching this film making riding giants brilliant personal include any of 's comments what with his hamilton 's at and the at 
 i have been getting into the series very much lately i find myself always one of his movies when i 'm at blockbuster or hollywood video like i said before hollywood is it 's touch i needed a reminder that there are films out there not to mention i want to be a film not a movie is there any better way to do that than with alfred 's movies the man who knew too much is another great and 
 N is and plot less i would add to that list but the although not done very well helps it to narrowly escape that label the has changed from the california to the islands and the only returning cast members from the first film are the guy and collins who at one point falls into a pit bringing back memories of her classic with in the big house all the other actors are new but apparently is supposed to be 
 this has to be the most comedy i 've ever seen in my life ben jack black and christopher as a homeless man ca n't make me something 's got to be wrong with this picture this is the only movie i 've ever felt like walking out of i used free passes and still felt like i wanted my money back i can say that the only movie i 've ever seen worse than this one was house of 
 a few years back the same persons who created paris which was but very my rating was a N created this piece of garbage about new york paris i love you created a feeling for paris & it was made in many parts of beautiful this current film i did not recognize new york city i did not feel that i was in the city of my york does have N i saw no scenes in the bronx or there 
 please do n't waste your money on this sorry excuse for a motion picture the only way i could see someone watching this is if they are a fan of but you would be better off the than to watch this piece of i would rather watch dry than go through watching this they lure you in with and and lead you to believe it is a movie but it quickly works out to be a about van 's you 
 we 've got extreme violence although not as extreme as other we 've got plenty of sex and but something is missing oh yes it 's missing the intelligence that paul is known for in his movies i the way the characters and how they have a sense of humor but unlike most films the movie itself does n't have enough humor for it to fall into the comedy the acting overall was above average compared to most makes man 
 this is absolutely the worst movie i 've seen all i will say that the acting was very good and by all of the was apparently meant to be very and in that regard it succeeded by the same the story around a who is a whose source of confidence comes from a pair of leather was worse than watching a car 
 this movie is exciting and the music is very movie was meant to with the bad N have is excellent movie begins with michael jackson performing man in the mirror on it shows a history of michael from his early days in the jackson N right up to the bad era oh and is good too is a music video of the music video for bad the single then shows the speed song and the video are very very good 
 the hero john is going after some drug dealers who for some reason on his he uses and moves and i do n't believe he got hit a single time during the movie this is 
 when i in to my local pbs station last night to watch the war that made america i was expecting a instead i got a very good and of the major events of the time now i see the reasons for the american revolution and the part the indian wars played larry is george washington and he is perfect for that part the to the camera also work i 'm looking forward to next week to see the rest it 
 i absolutely love this game to death ever since i was N years old i am now N it has great graphics characters magic weapons additions and do n't forget the ultimately forms i am still waiting for a or a to this spectacular video game you play as a young who has the potential to be quite the hero on this you creatures and boss fights you also some friends on the way who have their own special element 
 this is about a mad scientist who creates a half half man type on an island then calls up all his old business and academic to come and see his creation evil but actually he wants his to kill them lots of bad plot elements and in tight monster movies all follow a similar formula but this one things up with a bit of humor i guarantee the folks who made this had firmly planted in not to mention the 
 this movie is bad news and i 'm really surprised at the level of big name talent who would ever agree to appear in such a piece of junk as this i imagine there were a few agents across hollywood as a result of this what really gets you is that it could have been good the directors star appeal and the subject matter was sufficient to spark interest and ticket sales but this is a the multiple story lines 
 i thought it was an original story very told i think all you people are expecting too much i mean it 's just a made for television movie what are you expecting some great wonderful piece i thought it was a really great story for a made for television movie and that 's my opinion 
 i recently had the pleasure of meeting mr. at the N film festival for the u.s. premier of this film not only was he enough to my copy of he took the time to answer some questions about the film before the room for a packed theatre i was so impressed by the film that i used it as the by which to compare all other films i had seen at the festival it was powerful and moving yet and 
 in the areas where they this fine movie is light years ahead of which gave the impression of a eye and heavy breathing young here the effect is much more realistic and really gets inside the heads of the three as they their way through an with the three principals all unknown to me give very performances the kind in fact that may be so natural that it will be difficult for them to this quality of acting in other 
 i was n't sure whether to or cry was good looking but like a mexican star not an english what a with strips of black leather on it it was 's clothes or lack of them that really got me do the ' of this really believe women dressed like that in england the and were inaccurate and stupid but the episode with an was worst of all especially as his make up mainly of on his face an old 
 i do n't know why all the previous comments are approval of this movie it is well not by far but the movie i 've seen lately full of bad acting actually no very bad acting and has a silly plot if i would have seen it in a i would have walked out after the first N minutes i f you hate somebody make watch this movie that 's how bad it is a girl who has an that 
 the was a great decade for british with many popular such as one foot in the grave absolutely the thin blue line the empire and men badly onto tv screens for the first mr. is hands down the greatest of the represents the first major attempt at a to the era of silent such as charlie and for several decades it brings to the audience a single character mr. played to by people who have on this page as well 
 ' is a film about a major who makes life a living hell for his small group of boys in the this film does not really have a lot to offer but it provides several moments that are a watch do n't expect it to be a film however just expect to your way through the film and at the expense of other people the confrontation between major and the boy were and that 's really all i remember about 
 i saw this film at the international film festival of brussels i also met the director of the film i heard that ed wood wrote the story in N years i 'm sure he thought his would be his his if you take the film seriously like mr. wood did it is really one of the worst films you will ever see and this is cool the big joke of i up early the day i died is that it 
 this piece about adults who return to the summer camp of their youth was a very quiet and to the in the autumn of i 'd say that was a shame but then again some of the better movies are quiet releases that do n't get much or lane kevin elizabeth vincent warner bill williams craven and alan who is painfully good here are the group of actors who out these roles as people who have grown old with good 
 everything about choose was especially the script and the very work done by the director writer producer a young man from whom to expect great things all the acting was credible the dialogue smart the theme important loved it saw it at the N film festival where it was twice and went over with the audiences it 's more than just a coming of age movie this kid a hard lesson about trust politics and the system how things really 
 going into this movie i had heard good things about it coming out of it i was n't really nor disappointed simon plays a rather character much like his other movies there were a couple of here and there nothing too funny probably my favorite parts of the movie is when he in the club scene i totally got try that out next time i find myself in a club a couple of stars here and there including fox that 
 the lovely actress richter this film from under the of everyone no small feat considering the performances surrounding plays an somewhat and perhaps actress who a job looking after a aged father named the great actor who died at N shortly after this film was made refuses to respond to anyone until he the whose and manner brings the poor old battered back from a death eric has made a strong film about the difficulty a businessman son played by 
 i think that this is possibly the movie i have ever seen robert 's script is near perfect just check out the quotes section on second thought just rent the since it 's the delivery that really makes the lines field gives a comic performance like you 've never seen from her anywhere else and kevin is robert downey jr. is typically brilliant and in a very small role is a as the beleaguered i was never much of a 
 i have watched every version of this play that i can think of including several on the stage and sir is absolutely the best i have ever seen he has the most wonderful voice for stage acting and his face will take you on a roller of throughout this play the way in which he his lines takes you on a through he as can in an instant be soft and and in another instant be against the hell that 
 my comment is for the russian version of space race named battle for space shown on russia 's first channel on april bad translation could have some details but i doubt it 's the case the number of errors is such that it 's impossible to list them especially in the first episode the development of first missiles even the u.s. half of the film contains multiple errors and the audience is not told of any from the u.s. three 
 not a bad word to say about this film really i was n't initially impressed by it but it grew on me quickly i like it a lot and i think its a shame that many people ca n't see past the fact that it was banned in some mine being one of them the film in the shock and atmosphere department the score is a beautiful piece of delivering it only seems fair that chris young went on to 
 after N minutes mostly fast it off my recorder the first movie was fun the conversation between the just before them away off the for example this film just along waiting for someone to shoot it and put it out of your ca n't imagine anyone who worked on this turkey being proud of was fun four just was awful do n't bother even if the alternative is watching reruns of a N club you 'll at least get some 
 they do each is worst you who think that N or N need a N please watch this you 'll be wondering with the first three parts then you 'll give a N to the first N to the second and N or N to the other that 's because N really gets the big N from me it does 
 this movie was pretty good the acting was great and there were some really great actors in it like and roger moore this film is full of surprises confusing at times yes but the and turns of the plot always keeps you in the only thing that this movie had too much of was cars 
 there are some things you just do n't do so says the of this a N david comedy about a young man caught up in one situation after another entitled my boss 's daughter and it 's the which should speak for both the people that made this junk as well as those contemplating watching it there are indeed some things you just do n't do with the placing of mostly all of the sort of content to be found 
 i watched this film early is the best film i have ever watched and i will never forget it as long as i live i hate wars i hate wars i hate wars i wonder why we humans still let wars happen do you do you know why all these wars go on and on and on innocent people get killed even today for stupid and i watched this film early is the best film i have ever watched and 
 having seen and loved this film in australia i was very keen to get me on a copy i got one on back in the only to find that it 's a very different domestic i saw is the and i european spends a lot longer on the played by 's dead in truth that and few other points to no real is not a serious criticism but the is just and i think more ca n't say why they 
 i wish i had my rental money back from this piece of trash so i could it to the home for aged actors total five people watched this movie at the same time and there was n't one single to be heard lots of though 's a beautiful woman and she was the best thing to look at in the entire so-called movie 
 do not avoid this movie simply because it is so bad that it is absolutely it possibly is the worst movie i have ever seen but it was so bad that my friends and i were able to at every single moment of this film at times we actually whether it was this bad on purpose but we 're pretty sure that it is not characters appear out of nowhere as if they have already been established the changes scene 
 i saw this film on the a & e channel this past weekend the mystery was i was not able to guess the before the end but i enjoyed the characters and their development much more than the mystery there was a mystery about some of them especially george performed by the wonderful michael and george 's in fact the story of those two characters left me wanting to know more from what i 've tried to about the christie

 some of the acting was a bit suspect i remember that alexander walker evening standard critic ok he 's now dead launched into a about this film saying it was a portraying as now with respect to all this film was based on the who were and who in the N 's believe me they were not called for nothing my main about this film is the it shows no ray of light or hope it 's all & i 
 saw this today with my N year old i thought it was i agree with the other that it was n't anything like the book that i can remember but we still enjoyed it all of the kids are pretty good and all in all pretty entertaining is the new kid who a by the school to eat N in a day if he loses he has to walk down the hall at school with in his the beginning of 
 minor is n't scary but it is it is an interesting ' story with good acting and great special effects plot a little girl blames the strange things going on at her family 's new house and accompanying on her movie does n't waste time getting moving though the ending could have been more do n't recommend this movie to those but i do recommend it to those who want a and not necessarily a 
 i recently viewed manufactured at the seattle international film festival i was drawn to the movie as a because i 'm both familiar and a fan of 's work while i believe the movie does a good job getting it 's message across i could n't help but feel that it was made as a complete to the photographs and subsequent popular book by obviously one reason for this is the extensive use of still photographs featuring and across them 
 a huge hit upon release with australian audiences it can still be funny today but its political and blunt can make it a bit of a it goes on far too long some of the content could have been saved for the barry holds his own which desperately needed some new stuff anyway granted his attitude is funny but also becomes as the film on some say 's are the best and they are certainly original but the of barry 
 films always have been commercial films which the N 's from last few films were family was film is a decent film but could be problem lies in there is lot of old thrown in and many scenes come out too and 's character is shown very well but his character gets which could be lengthy could be avoided as are simply long the street play in the second half look too and hardly a solution though the message is 
 this is an excellent movie with a cast and some great acting i never tire of watching it i especially love the scene where danny 's character and kevin 's character namely simon and mack have together kevin is such a natural and it seems his are and one you would often so its a very ' movie one of the most powerful scenes in the movie however is at the beginning of the movie when simon at the scene

 it seems to me that a lot of people do n't know that is actually a movie on par with and the likes what all these heroes and in the case of hero group have in common is that they were all in the world of was originally a normal person in a blue outfit who because of a personal and eventually facing of with himself and he was for lack of a better word boring so boring in fact

 great british director christopher directs this odd film about a struggling writer with following people this proves at first but soon turns dangerous after taking the game a step further after meeting a man who shows him the and of breaking and entering the two men soon get in over their heads in a strange world involving the mafia and plays the writer and alex the friend both are great performances this low budget movie was shot total with no 
 i am a specializing in the field of and i must say that this film high quality in the context throughout the entire film to anyone who has not yet seen this i recommend that you also read man 's search for ultimate meaning by victor e. i think you will be able to draw some amazing being said i would like to say that despite the fact that the main characters are this is not a story about being 
 john is an union officer who plans to sell his ranch and land to the 's over at the trouble is that the price being offered is way to low and when they start to and his workers he has a change of heart particularly when things take a turn for the after watching this one i had a sense of frustration because of the cast that was involved when you got edward g. robinson glenn ford and barbara in 
 i upon this movie because i had a free release from blockbuster and needed to grab something quickly as the store was getting ready to close for the evening the plain white cover and title me i 'm a relatively speaking old lady and my son is a young man of i movies that are sheer entertainment such as the sixth sense interview with a harry and my son on the other hand is a film graduate and enjoys very 
 although i agree that it 's a good but not great movie for many of the reasons other have mentioned i still enjoy it one reason is the music i 'd call attention to the very cool appearance by the brothers and pete in a scene in the these guys were two of the best jazz of their day and they manage to the mind of stewart by playing an one in each of stewart 's the really did play 
 this is the worst italian movie ever quite possibly the worst movie of all time joe is of course no but many of his movies are interesting and this is not one of them its and boring boring if you want a movie to get N if you want a movie to put someone into a get deep blood 
 so your are away on a the wife is visiting the mother in law you though are at home it 's a dark and night and there is no football on the and the needs so now what are you going to do i will tell you go make an old cocoa is best get hold of some and sit down in front of the now go select and play arthur world war two the ghost train return to that 
 i 'm this film on a curve in other words it is n't the greatest film that has ever been made but it does exactly what it set out to do this is an excellent & a film i have no idea the count of how many 's or a 's were seen in this film but i did see one shot that had N 's at one time just to give you an idea there are all throughout there 
 being a fan of the first lion king i was definitely looking forward to this movie but i knew there was really no way it could be as good as the original i know that many disney fans are wary of the movies as i have mixed feelings of them as watching the lion king i tried to figure out what my own viewpoint was regarding this movie am i going to be so about the lion king that i 
 mobile suits that can entire check weapons that hardly need to be aimed and still everything check mobile suits based on angels check ok its a series this one has good character development interesting ideas and some pretty characters the initially weak later then back to gets stronger and more independent although is still absolutely with the series main character the initially a cold hard becomes more and more human while still remaining and seeing the lost de is float 
 i can not comment on this film without discussing its significance to me personally as a child bad health prevented me from ever going to a i first encountered movies at the end of through roger book film which brought me so much pleasure as my health began to improve that i wish i could buy another copy to today my introduction to many films such as the 's the cabinet of and came first through this book and later 
 this film is a great fun i recommend you watch it yourself and then watch it again with your friends i did last night and it was how well could pull everybody into her world i did feel a little bit strange watching my friends go through the same roller as i did the first time but they all me and loved the movie you know it is a great film if you spend N hours after the film talking 
 the movie was very sweet and i cry almost every time i watch the movie i would recommend this movie for every one the movie was so to me the actors did a great job of acting and the movie was very well played and done the movie was about a little girl who owned a of whom she named had gotten from her by her parents because they thought it would be best for had experienced so many people 
 is the most moving and film i 've ever seen often as a movie this i believe is a grave error some once called it the thinking person 's nightmare on street and while i accept the logic of his conclusion i ca n't help but think it 's a tag that is ill and misleading those that can only see are truly missing out here and only serves to demonstrate they 're really not thinking at all in fact 
 and also a wonderful beginning a real quick start it keeps you and waiting for is about to come unfortunately the high off quickly but most certainly after half the movie is it 's a shame because this movie has really good ideas and many of them but that is also one of it 's by exploring too many things it get 's mixed up into to many things so in the end you 're too confused to follow any 
 i am surprised that there is confusion over the title of this film quite obviously it is an investigation into the nature of modern love it is suggesting that love is love while the going is good but one in which people reserve the right to put themselves first and if the going gets tough they get out and go onto something has implications as it is coming from generation x makes comment on generation x and in the end 
 such a as the first of these two river films was the to the man from river is everything that a should be it does not on the of its predecessor to leave the that was the first film live on in some unique man from river ii is based upon the return of jim craig to the river country after a three year absence the film tells a tale of change in the century of australian history and horses 
 as a talk about and gets my heart racing however i found this presentation too slow and not packed with enough information for the interested who is most likely to see it if you have more than a passing in this sort of stuff go to the library and check out some books you will find they explain current scientific with far more detail while at the same time filling you with more of a sense of wonder than this 
 this film has a special place in my heart as the worst movie i have ever seen it is about as fun as doing hard labor with the movie starts out bad i would rate the first few minutes of the film a and then it get worse minute by minute the only way to rate it at all would be some kind of negative number that grows for long minutes is not a real word but it best describes 
 this one of those social that knew how to put together and were guaranteed hits in the this early dead end kids are sent to a reform school where they are a as part of a deal is appointed as the commissioner of the school he does n't take it seriously at first but he changes and makes the necessary changes to improve the lives of the boys the idea is to let the boys rule and their community whether 
 i enjoyed this film and after it finished it still makes you think about it i believe is brilliant in this role although his death acting was a little over the top but as its i did n't is a good piece of drama and does follow novel very closely if you enjoy this film then i recommend you also watch an ideal husband with as lord film gives a great insight into way of while watching it the is 
 at first of this i was a bit disappointed that lee jones and did n't return to the cast both john and barbara did jobs replacing very important characters for the continuing of this legendary western cherokee jack jackson played an excellent bad guy and louis jr. was as always true to form with his excellent acting drama that seemed true to life in many scenes including one of the best where the ended with walker being killed made me 
 it 's amazing to see how manages to attract people to the theater till the very day of the release i mean look at the cast here the promotion is good enough and the are fine this makes it a house full on the first day but it 's only when people go and see the film they realize that there is no way their money is house full the first day the movie is out the next week this 
 it was a sunday night and i was waiting for the advertised movie on tv they said it was a comedy the movie started N minutes passed after that N minutes and i did n't not even once the fact is that the movie ended and i did n't get even on to please someone me i lost N minutes for nothing 
 like all of the very earliest films this movie is very very short lasting about one minute so because of its it 's not really possible to compare it to more modern films but for its time it 's actually a very remarkable film much of this is because the prints were hand painted making appear red and other colors as she does her amazing dance i 've actually seen two different versions one where she is red and another 
 this film is and misses the mark it is far off compared to the N batman that it tries to that women singer her name can not act and we see why her film carrier died notice how this film died in the box office no one see this film on tv either my uncle and were expecting batman and the films impression is more like rock not worth 
 by far this has to be one of the worst movies i 've ever seen in my life i watch practically every movie that is on at night either showtime hbo etc three island keeps you in as much as watching dry only to let you down even more if you want to feel like you just wasted what seems like an on the worst film ever created then by all means watch this movie i must have at a 
 i 'd just like to say that i 've seen this film twice now and i love it the acting is great and even though it is a similar plot to raise your voice i think that the plot never gets boring for people who like that kind of thing it has some great in it and shows us that we can do anything if we try an incredible film i am sure that this is one i will be 
 the big problem is where to begin as this movie needs your attention the two hours and you better not miss some minutes for getting a coke as there is a danger you ca n't follow but good there is also a bruce must travel into a to find out some for a virus that made animals rule over the world in thanks to some mistakes he first ends up in N then in the first world war and how 
 weak bobby and mario bring this being the worst definitely a one i think they could have gotten other american chefs to come to the table on this one as the iron chefs the kind of this duo come up with really do n't reflect on the creativity of the original iron series i do n't think even went to school actually there are a lot of great chefs in america i just wonder why they do n't appear on 
 the first time my best friend and i sat down to watch this movie we were watching it for alex winter of bill & ted 's fame we did n't know what to expect other than who and what it was the time the movie was over we knew that it was love at first sight this movie while not completely historically accurate was and is the best one of its i have seen other movies the history of this 
 i have n't seen this movie in a while so i 'm afraid i ca n't be very specific about details it did have some interesting points ralph 's attempt at an of 's was a very ambitious project so ambitious in fact that it went bankrupt at some point during the production therefore not only does it stop abruptly somewhere around the middle of the second book of the with sort of a of a hint of a that 
 live action version of via lord comes to earth to get the seven magic balls which when brought together will cause a to appear and grant your wish lots of action and bad comedy can i say that the best way to watch this film is with lots of drunk but friends does n't i do n't know this is a really bad but funny in the way that really bad movies can be come on this is one of 
 my favorite quote from was when the car was going off the the movie is so bad even the car wants to get out of it this had to be the movie i have ever seen it was seriously out there to scare you which makes it even if it were n't for mystery science theater i would n't be here today 
 this film is bad you can tell that all the actors are embarrassed to be associated with such a truly terrible movie there are obvious budget constraints but with a little thought and attention to detail the movie could have been so much better for example check out the scene where first goes to the and is talking to his friend the the murdered taxi driver is lying on the you can actually see the breathing what could n't they 
 be warned this is that other wo n't even to be in company with because it 's beneath them got that out of the way let me say something more 've seen of time a very long time ago thinking it was a fresh take on the material which is based on a highly of a novel due to the emerging reputation of the director well despite of all of that has n't succeeded at the novel on screen according 
 the most impressive thing about ' is its title an which is very nearly also a unfortunately it only works in american english since in britain ' is 've always found the man ray and his artistic efforts to be deeply and i 've never understood why his work attracts so much attention apart from his which he invented by accident and which are merely photo prints his one real contribution to culture seems to be that he was the

 films about the mundane are often the most interesting of all films to me in the hands of an artist who all the little details of the mundane the french seems to often be very good at this sort of thing and i love the french film was about the mundane it did n't have a much of a plot it was just characters who lived in a town very normal people and stuff just happened but it was n't 
 's dead eyes the thick writing of it and harrison ford being in a comedy here 's N reasons to hate it avoid it and to N minutes of your life movies are fun however their real golden age was back in the and the making one that tries to mix action and comedy through the police of hollywood itself is sure a good idea but the final result of that turned out to be not at least a of 
 at least the by tim was roberts is the his usual characters are roberts changes his even within one line 
 if you 've ever seen the for the film the recruit with farrell and al you 'll never have to see that film renaissance has had similarly story of renaissance is about a investigating the of a young woman and medical researcher the setting is a paris and science elements feature throughout the special thing about renaissance though is its style and not its story renaissance is computer like final fantasy but highly into black and white with sharp contrasts 
 i 'm a don johnson fan but this is undoubtedly the worst movie done by anybody that i 've ever seen the acting was bad as was the don should stick to doing action because as the king he just did n't cut it 
 god abc picked this up instead of fox the best for those in the know is really meets dead like me in the best way 'm not sure whether an experience with death and early in life makes me a fan of brian but i certainly enjoy his productions i also enjoy floors talking toys and other items while a bit i certainly think this enjoys its own niche that does n't require or carter to be a here we 
 i did n't buy this i did n't rent this it was on and someone burned a copy of it and it to me so at least i wasted no money on it for someone that did the 's this is a pretty film seems to have something to do with a bunch of that were at a back in the day and now they 're all grown up and they 're being pursued and killed one by one by 
 i caught this movie on local at about N N a.m. i did n't have expectations for it but after the opening credits i knew i was into something are situations that are left for your interpretation to find out what really happened so your attention is a key whole psychological situation deals a lot with character development and the way things are executed by the main also plays an important part because through a series of events and you 
 to be honest this film is another in a series of huge disappointments most of these so-called masters of films are only in terms of their effects and story lines aside from ron perlman everyone else in this film can not act to save their life the sounded like someone was playing under the boom mike or something and looked completely overall this film is about as scary as home alone the only good masters are cigarette burns and maybe 
 this is one of those movies that you and a bunch of friends sit around drinking beers eating pizza and at unfortunately for me i found myself watching this one alone my friends and i a big block of movies and never got around to seeing this one it was due back and i figured that it was a waste not to watch it so i did and i was impressed at how absolutely terrible this movie i love bad 
 when it first came out this work by the brothers was much criticized and even to be it is now hailed as a of especially now that society has been exposed to real in what is reality television and the bad evolution of most direct at first we must say that this is n't really direct it is more the difference between the two is very slight but it mainly is the fact that in this we are made to 
 alert it just gets to me the some people have to and i use the term here good movies in the american version of this dutch someone decided the original ending was n't enough for american audiences so what do they do they create a new one a stupid kind of ending do yourself a favor and get the original one 
 man this movie is awful this kind of is what gives canadian a bad name or no name well to be fair i guess most canadian movies give canadian a bad to the characters there 's a couple that are the most in movie history the most thing is the and pace of the movie it 's like a making its way to is nice to look at she 's the only thing that kept me watching unfortunately the rest 
 i recently purchased lost horizon on having vivid memories of the things i will not miss number from i am an ancient N i also recently finished the novel upon which it is based i was so surprised to find a genuine hidden a wonderful cast brings such and to a simple and told story from the original film and by now quite a separate entity to the far more intellectual and thought book by james hilton in particular has 
 from outer space is pretty much up by its name running only N minutes long it describes a of blacks that come to earth to free the men from women while i see a little significance to the plot it also is really granted its meant to be a on society and science i found myself laughing several times so it succeeds special effects are horrible when the is floating above the earth you can see stars by for no 
 i really wanted to love this film i have read the book to my daughters and we all loved it the book is this film is very far from the book the book is this film is an awful the book is kind strong and never does anything to get back at anyone that 's the point of the book she as a regardless of circumstances an important part of like a is to not return it is to regardless 
 i first saw this movie back in N or during my freshman year in high school when it was on lifetime after i first saw it i thought it was wonderful sure it may not have run longer but it is as accurate as can be in my own opinion regardless of what anyone else may think cynthia was great at portraying karen and mitchell anderson was as richard fletcher yes who played in N 's one flew over the

 i will admit that i did not give this movie much of a chance i decided pretty early on that this just was n't my kind of the most part it has an excellent look in terms of its the scenes of early N 's manhattan look very good as does the lead actress it is a very black and white which could almost make the movie feel and fresh however some of the other techniques the employ shoot that 
 a wonderful film to watch with scenes and actors such as and after N minutes of watching your eyes get locked on the screen and you do nothing but breathing in the atmosphere of the film waiting what the will bring to the characters this film makes you leave your position as a standard audience it takes you in it makes you a part of the story and are brilliant especially the district of the is built it is definitely 
 i watched this movie on television today i was absolutely by the powerful messages and plot line within this film i do n't want to it i will say this i related to the inner struggle of and his as a man growing up in a small town i related so well to the big secret and the choices i made this movie has made a huge impact on me and i plan on buying a copy of it in 
 this is one of the best movies during the late it was filled with a great cast a powerful and many of the players involved gave great performances was great he should have been for something john was good too as long as the does n't mind his he may come off as if you ca n't stand this the way that 's character with 's character was dramatic and slightly at times danny was as always david was great 
 how irish critics about this movie is beyond me by the usual band of irish actors dragged out for every irish movie terrible script with forced character the brown all that is bad about the attitude of it 's a dump but sure it great all the same ' plenty of for american audiences the supermarket boss and his forced and the in the was 's character a great actor forced to play this part that could 've been written 
 taste is a thing two people can watch the same movie with one of them it and the other one it as it concerns the of michael ' i fall into the latter 'm of the opinion that john carpenter in N made one of that decade 's films which despite its flaws still holds up well into the century it many of the old film devices but them in original and effective ways it had no that it was

 what we have here is a film about how the pursuit of money & can corrupt your soul or something like that guy a director known for his of the off more than he can with this use of modern film to tackle the theme of a man setting himself free by his pride being nice to his enemy & giving away all his money falls flat on it 's face when 's character no longer fears ray it apparently 
 and in no way as clean logical and as in in that sum of tired hollywood 'm N and i 've spent N years of my life struggling through and like the main character in the film i was successful mainly because of logic because i kept thinking over and over to keep away from reality and to know what was really going on and what was n't in the end i was really successful because of medication by the 
 i loved this movie not because of the romantic story lines between women but for the of human strength and liberation this film is a must see entertaining emotional all the characters are very well written and portrayed by some very actors this story is a story of discovery and sexual a of the mind body and soul you find yourself identifying with the characters and at some points even the i do have to say that i recommend watching 
 i hardly know where to begin in writing about this except to say that it represents young at the peak of his powers and must certainly rank with the best short ever made the is minutes of smoothly executed two of comic driven by an of and yet somehow leading to a happy ending which was n't always the way with 's see for one case where ultimately got the better of him or one week for the victory of 
 one of my movies nothing can beat watching this movie for the first time if i could go back in time and my memory or suffer from i would so i could enjoy this movie as much as i did that very first time it 's still second and third times round but i found myself the more as the shocks and were n't unexpected if you want a see a film that you truly wo n't be able to 
 the film a universal release of a production is a boring of the theory of breaking down the structure of an object it in a cell as pure energy and then sending it back complete to a target area there is no explanation why this is necessary but professor paul played by actor bryant thinks it 's something to his and his ' pat hill mary and chris mitchell ronald allen lives to during an experiment before noted dutch scientist

 i guess by the time i saw this episode i had seen enough zones to have it figured out ahead of time there is this odd of characters who find themselves at the bottom of a they are fine until an shows up in their midst it is his prime to escape and so he the forces and puts them to work to reach the top of the there is much discussion about purpose and reason and speculation on their 
 one of the best comedy series to ever come out of britain mark and steve are actors and performers who seem at home with drama as they are with comedy supported by their writing partner they have the series with the most characters of recent years little britain into as a poor of their ideas consistently original and i am sure that as many people hate these series as love them but i am equally as sure that no one

 i was a huge fan of the original to say i was disappointed by this first would be an problems are though the film may look there are plenty of on screen for all to see wires etc something i find wholly from someone of 's has become a robot there is no spark of to be found in the character here a true disappointment when one considers that his soul had returned by the end of the first movie 
 even if you 're not a big fan rock ' roll high school is still the greatest rock ' roll movie ever made why because under all the it with respect the and often feel and so for the boring stupid establishment world of adults that final scene is one of the most and final scenes to a movie i have ever seen mine eyes have seen the glory of the rock ' roll 
 and of an old english film although it may be overly as a total disaster which it is not it never builds any tension and its tv richard burton through his role and 's closed in this movie face does n't display much passion either 
 this is a piece of that deals with a boys confused cut scenes within can be lengthy but the is film would not appeal to many people especially those who are about relationships but the more open can with the 
 this is a waste of expect from an action movie to have more than N explosions and some 's acting is awful he never was much of an actor but here it is was definitely better in his earlier movies his part for the whole movie was probably not more than one page of stupid nonsense one whole in the film is a disaster same as the title the makes no sense why did n't they just call it border 
 walter can always improve a film and this movie proves it he turns in a very realistic performance as a horse and single father not either can be by turns and then to his boys and we can see the same in his approach to horse training we see that he does n't want his young prospect racing horse and hurt in races but he seems to be willing to risk the horse 's life when he gets into the 
 when i saw this movie in the theater when it came out in N via a free advanced i was totally and would have paid to see it i was sorry when i talked to many people who had also seen it and who were totally disappointed with it and how it ended i on the other hand felt completely the opposite i was totally satisfied with the outcome and everything else people i talked to said there was too 
 i enjoy movies like this for their spirit no intended its a decent clean movie about a baseball team that 's falling behind and a young fan wishes for them to win since his said that was the only way he 'd come back for him the spirit through in two ways a funny cast with danny and a young joseph and the herald al taking the dynamic form of christopher lloyd its an energetic movie it gets you smiling 
 one night i was waiting for my friends to come back to the apt and happened to be on i watched way too much of it it is indeed and really think about it this way if in your job you had an idea for something this bad and went on to execute it in as terrible a fashion as this how long exactly would you last not as long as this movie it 's a obviously 
 this was one of the most and of the films i have ever seen the representation of the other of the was and unfair for one the song played on ' car radio when pulled up alongside a very israeli driver was i put a on you by atlas the song 's style is quite but it was released on an israeli cd and i have even heard it on the radio in israel many israeli as well as architecture 
 if you like to get a couple of fleeting of on some attractive women there may be a second or two of from this film if you enjoy seeing poorly and executed action scenes there are plenty if you are both blind and i still advise you to not have this film on in your presence it is surely the worst or very close to the worst film i have ever seen and it does appear that there was some 
 this was boring the leading man christian has got to be the worst actor i have ever seen and another thing if the character in the movie moved to america when he was ten or something and had been living here for over N years he would speak a lot better english than what he pulls of here or to say it in my own language but it is cool to see norwegian in a movie made in hollywood it 
 i saw this movie at the international film festival with the great dr. in film is simply put very very bad and no not in the usual so bad it 's actually entertaining way but just plain bad the plot concerns a man who leads a terrible life because of a past criminal record apparently ca n't get a job and with an awful N pound cheating wife this man turns to his uncle in a plan to steal a 
 naturally along with everyone else i was to expect a lot of hollywood fantasy in they died with their on over the of just having someone like play is enough of a clue that the has over the truth in this production and for the most part my expectations were in an and entertaining way even in this obviously and much criticized of the story i was struck by some of the points made in this movie that sometimes but 
 a group of evil businessmen need to knock down a building to build a huge complex but they ca n't remove the tenants the tenants and businessmen with their hired clash until the film ends with one of the fights ever the guy with the hair who goes ' every time he throws a and the other guy who with a in his mouth instead of fighting only to be beaten off camera make this essential if you like to 
 in april of N cbs broadcast the first of 's television the show was not only a runaway ratings success but N as well this is one of the most moments of N 's television and unfortunately the kind of television special they do n't produce anymore filled with wonderful and a spectacular performance by this special is a must view for any fan and anyone interested in early television 
 i really enjoyed this both times i watched it and both times i walked away thinking about it and the of the story a great deal i agree with another in that the movie is not around the aspects you might expect from an movie but rather is about the human condition the characters in the hospital provide a great insight in to that and how they go from to hope this movie has of to to to the final 
 this is n't one of those reviews about poor special effects or technology or being dated issues that only the people could with but rather a review on the story telling which most of us are truly interested plot is about a combination of allied and german navy members and two the hero and who are thrust together on a german u boat and wind up in a land of are n't so bad by film standards and we know

 rules of is one of the best i have ever seen it is well constructed together and provides excellent to back up the that it takes on the movie 's best quality is that it is not based on being sympathetic to the as much as it the audience to the mistakes and lies that surrounded the entire situation i 'm left with feelings of disturbing anxiety and extreme anger over the way that the government handled and then covered 
 the goal of any james bond game is to make the player feel like he is an ultimate fantasy step into the shoes of agent comes closer to this goal than any other game because this time you control the real james bond no to who made a bond and his voice and to but was the original james bond and there will never be anyone who comes close to his level of must say at this point like many 
 this movie had it all action comedy and best of all some of the will remain a classic to be enjoyed by all who like good picture i have it in my collection 
 perhaps i 'm one of the only fans who thinks that the recent of asian is so films like or the the eye which are praised all over the world simply did n't convince me and they looked more boring than well this blunt opinion does n't go for the south korean a tale of two this is a and utterly complex psychological that really gets under your skin the plot based on a local tale might be a little

 i bought dark seasons N & N two weeks ago after catching a couple of season N episodes on channel nothing prepared me for how brilliant the show is i have n't enjoyed anything as much since also and amazing show i 'll admit season N n't quite as good but there are still some amazing episodes see this bag the agenda harbor lights nation etc and is great i 've heard some of the plans for the would-be season 
 the print of the film we were going to watch burned in the fire at universal studios last week so we were stuck with video that could even be a for this king kong movie from studios ' director honda essentially it 's a warm up for king kong it even uses the idea of a like of course the movie with king kong fighting on top of the tower in tokyo but if you did n't know that already

 this is a forgotten classic of a film and harmony borrowed a ton from it for is good river 's edge is way way better its no secret that is n't the best actor whoever walked the earth no in fact he 's a actor but he was born for some roles ted from bill and ted and his role in this film he is perfect as a sort of good but very and confused then there 's i think 
 so we saw this on at our apartment here in paris we 're all here on an exchange program we all so hard so much of what was going on in the movie happened to us i mean sure some of it was pretty but still true know what i 'm think i related more to the quiet guy the italian than because i 'm more of the in our group anyway i wish i had a hot like de 
 this is the minute film that us to the character of the butcher who will later be examined more in the feature in this film it follows the early period of his life from but focusing on the late the first images are of a of a horse then the birth of a baby the butcher 's daughter who we quickly see growing up each year the butcher played by in both films is a man bitter with the world 
 i have mixed about this film especially as it compares to its an american in london that film had it 's funny moments it was still more of tale than anything else this version now set in paris does not have that edge at all and simply is n't in the same class but it does have some good things going for it that the first film did not have and overall it 's still fun to watch so aside 
 steven 's intent is to be and his acting in this film is equal to that in many of his others if you ignore the fact that he is supposedly portraying a brilliant scientist the problem i had was with two items of the plot which stretched my suspension of beyond the breaking how is it that a carefully engineered on a nasty whose must be just as carefully and engineered by a big lab is by drinking tea from 
 this is one of my personal a rare little that seems to be by the general population chris and form the heart of the piece in what is a cast few movies have ever captured the true that the civil war but this one seems to capture all the right and if you 're a fan of the book cold mountain try this movie out and see if you do n't think it makes a good companion piece

 i first saw this movie with my many years after it came out i thought i would hate it but to my surprise it is so that it 's great we 've spent many hours parts of the movie yes or i 'm sorry you had to see that baby sometimes in this world we see things that we do n't want my cracks up every time i neil also the music is classic and fun to along with especially 
 this guy has no idea of it seems he made a few theater shows in his youth and about two acceptable movies that had success more of political reasons cause they the communist censorship this all is very good but look carefully he does not know his job the scenes are without proper start and and with a content and full of he has nothing to say about the subject so he with violence and language how is it possible 
 born again is a episode from season one it deals with the subject of and just does n't fly i 've never been big on and that could be part of my toward this episode it does reference the case which is some nice from the previous episode but the end there which is unfortunate because that takes place at the beginning of the episode i think it 's that a dead guy would chose to in the body of 
 when a film is independent and not rated such as the i was expecting out of the cut out your heart violence i know that good movies do n't always contain blood and violence but i read reviews i visited the and i even convinced a few of my friends to pay $ to see this god awful movie with me when there is a festival called i am expecting not creek with my expectations were extremely low for this 
 the worst film ever watching this supposedly made film i suspect someone up a brain damaged half blind and had him make the worst film ever all in some attempt to attack culture i had to stop the movie and call a friend to come over just so i had someone to at when i the movie out of shock and at such sheer top of all the horrible writing and acting and and stupid plot its just a poorly 
 i 've seen my fair share of badly and final to films but i do n't recall any film that committed outright like this one film makers were clearly hoping that the great twist would ' us all and it did but perhaps not in the way the directors had hoped i was left feeling surprised that harris and had anything to do with this turkey or film up until the final minutes was rather engaging and i like the 
 this is such a great movie to watch with young children i 'm always looking for an excuse to watch it over & over was good was fun the russian was good maria was & of course was the best 
 this movie was it had absolutely nothing to do with dark harvest and the was very misleading because it showed a and a neither of which appeared in this beginning was a of random scenes that most of which had nothing to do with the movie except that they sort of show that the man is but not too well after the first N minutes of the movie there is an hour of just the man character looking for his 
 i had the pleasure of attending a of the pacific and last weekend at the santa barbara international film festival this film had caught my attention a little while back when i across an article about it in magazine seemed interesting at the time but nothing too exciting i saw it on the festival program and decided to check it out all i can say is that i was when the ending credits began to roll this is one of 
 watching some of the the entire of the film devoted to the battle on the ice in alexander a film directed by the russian m. by in his only significant credit made me realize how much must really go into at least on a scale such as this if i were a member of an group at the time of this film 's release i probably would award with the director 's award of the year it is such a 
 one calls alive a film for the are there such people i did n't know but if you are one of them have a ball the rest of you might find this a bit hard to intended even if like me you consider yourself a film i have been an fan for about N years now although i never got around to the until a few weeks ago and i guess i owe my short-lived interest in these movies enough 
 where was his of democratic as well as republican ones after all he did serve for years in a body of government where his influence was oh i about the N years he was the in command of the most powerful nation on earth the film is happy to show shots of a young senator asking why a nasa scientist was forced to change a conclusion in his scientific paper but fails to ask about the of in global warming

 i just purchased and viewed the of this film the transfer is from last year this N film is really a great little film by most people i saw it in the theater in N and have loved it ever since i love the opening shot of pittsburgh not baltimore as another user makes pittsburgh look like one of the most beautiful cities in the world and i must say the tour of on the garbage truck with is a 
 when my own child is me to leave the opening show of this film i know it is bad i wanted to my eyes out i wanted to reach through the screen and mike for the last of dignity he had this is one of the few films in my life i have watched and immediately to if only it were possible the other films being N ' and and ' both which are better than this in the may 
 the title says it 'm not a film critic nor will i act like the rest of the people commenting on this this movie did n't have a dollar budget but the plot was very well done the acting was and the was great it looked like you all had a lot of fun making this movie i voted N out of N as the sound was strong on only one channel instead of both but i imagine this might 
 this movie really i mean really its got plot so big and N foot can fit through them not to mention the itself which is inevitably the worst computer generated image ever to be put on the film real i mean when you see something like this you got be thinking someone actually made this movie then released it that takes whoever they are i 'm sure they do n't work in the film business i hired this movie it 
 i must admit that at the beginning i was sort of about watching this movie i thought it was this stupid little romantic film about a french woman who meets in the train an american and decides to visit vienna with him i was not actually about this kind of script since it continued to make me believe that it is just a movie still i watched it and i was before is one of the few films who to

 an ally i do n't mind there are some pretty good ones out there but this one is a considering it was practically scene for scene it had a good story and great actors van al 's direction virtually and it added color i 'm not one of those who think it has to be b & to be classic it should have been at least a movie but it was i do n't understand how it could have been 
 this landmark film can now be seen in two different versions on the video release which also includes the english translation of 's novel which she based on a swedish the first version is the swedish under the title of the the second version is a of the way it was shown in the united states under the title of the of midnight as released by before it was the actual us release has long but a detailed review in

 mary tyler moore and harper still can turn the world on with their the combined talent of these two wonderful stars make this combination movie work watch it and look forward to hitting mary the youth society with and a touch of drama adds N a tv series follow up would broaden the new characters and give us a chance to see grant sue ann murray and 
 is a nice movie for whole family it 's obviously not a great movie free looks much better almost in every component of film making possibly at times it becomes a bit and the writing and the script are not the best part of the movie but it 's a entertaining film with very good including shots and some important moral messages wood proves himself one more time as an and actor he can make bad movie movie good good 
 i loved it fred is wonderful as johnson a somewhat proud yet at the same time very vulnerable player who is in love with who 's always there for him they meet in panama after comes off a ship and end up in a bar with anthony tony gets in the nose after her by thinking her a loose woman all because she took off her hat in public big and ends up stuck in panama and arthur are great 
 i 've been a classic fan my entire life many nights stretched until the early hours of the morning watching the universal films on incorporated and feature night i viewed this film in the early evening and yet it still almost put me to do n't think i 've ever seen a picture where everything was so matter of fact dr. does n't seem to believe in the yet before long he 's treating and watching larry change into the 
 amazing performance from simon who just gets better and better with every role as usual he plays the part of a very character who makes you want to hide behind your cushion in embarrassment for him sometimes but what is all were regular and eye and everyone of them aimed at penn the movie was very put together where every character plays a very sophisticated and serious part with penn being the only involved which is a huge credit to 
 it never to be a but it 's a of late british comedy given that the producers wanted to sell it abroad it stars an american the late character actor richard jordan but at least he is n't the usual hollywood type surrounding him is the of british character acting talent led by a and superior david 's ivan the terrible naturally gets the best one and all the best reaction shots he also manages to be surprisingly and dangerous 
 chris rock deserves better than he gives himself in down to earth as directed by brothers chris & paul of american pie fame this of warren 's N fantasy can wait itself a of N 's here comes mr. jordan lacks the humor that won chris rock an for his first hbo special predictably he words from a to z but he the anybody who saw this comic in weapon N or knows he can more with the than martin 
 the ghost train is a treat to those who appreciate the typical N 's it world war two into the plot but not as much as i initially believed it would and the characters are a unique who play their roles fairly well playing the role of is what the story up for the parts which could of been portrayed as boring or dragging story of the station is actually even for present day standards it is unique and the 
 i have not seen many low budget films i must admit but this is the worst movie ever probably the main character the old man talked like he had a and lost the power to speak more than one word every N seconds a N year old could act better the story had the most awful plot and well the army guy had put what he thought was army like and then just went over the top i only watched 
 perhaps it 's about time we declare N to be the international year of the the ridiculous came first about a named ruling the in then there was lake N a and to a original there 's this derivative and piece of and finally i have yet to see the promising the last one is likely to be the best considering the involvement of the talent wolf creek black water certainly is n't a complete waste of time and film 
 the book while not particularly great was decent but this movie completely changes it a lot of the elements of the story are consistent between the book and the movie but dr. ross ' character goes from a written character who lives for money and ends up causing the with her greed to a in who wo n't do anything if she even the hint that it might be less than noble when movies change the book that much but 
 it just seems to run true to form any movie is bad i do n't know if it is the fact that the in full of or that is such a bad actor no here he seems to overdue the pushing and and and thing in this movie in my opinion it is a wonder that some of these projects find venture capital to get in the can and to the theatre 
 i 've tried to remember the name of this movie for years and years finally read something today that mentioned 's name and it reminded me that i had seen a movie that he was in in N at the atlanta film festival so i did a search for 's movies and found the train we were supposed to see at the film festival but for some reason they were unable to show it and instead the train we were 
 i watched this film ago and the only thing i can remember about the film is how absolutely bad it was its definitely in my top N worst films i have ever to think i had to persuade my to get this film out at the video shop my reputation has been shot to because of this film will my ever trust me again i doubt it they always say do n't judge something by its cover they were right

 do n't know if this contains any or not but i do n't want to risk being until the year disagree entirely with the comments that have described guns and steel as politically correct and they can not have watched the same series that i series i watched the history of european in the and southern africa with no particular i saw nothing in the series that portrayed europeans as bad people who happened to be lucky though europeans often 
 well i have to say this movie was so bad that i would have walked out if i did n't have to review it for work and the worst part is i wanted to see it so badly that i drove all over the city paid $ N parking two times because the newspaper listings were wrong plays the guy he always does the only time i 've seen him play someone else was in that movie with john the 
 is very much like any number of late disney family cat from outer space or unidentified flying for instance utterly of anything creative beating the same to death yet entertaining in a sort of way the actors wo n't win any nor will the director writer or crew but in its and there is some vague entertainment to be had the idea of the robot dog as security system is so full of you could use it as a the 
 can a film be too to the book upon which it is based judging from the N of 's huge N seller the answer is rather ironically yes like many i was by the book an impressive first effort by the so obviously were director marc than and david who pay attention to the most significant details of the story within the film 's running time yet the of events in 's novel often comes across as and because and 
 just a few words this movie really it 's like those tv movies with bad cast and plot it 's amazing how they could make this worse than the iii do n't waste your time watching this even if you like the tremors movies 
 an independent feature can now be seen as both a work of film art and a video resume enter broken and aggressively minute short with style and to spare but is it any good as a film or does it only work as a piece there in lies the is the story of who is after from a nightmare one night by a and his quote from the video box as she 's held it becomes obvious that her know

 what can i say this was the worst movie i have ever seen in my life and believe me some of my favorite movies are horrible the acting was the sets were boring and the was and this whole movie seemed like a college final project i had to keep convincing myself that it was done by a to make it seem somewhat good the most disturbing factor of the film is that it 's not even film at all

 the rule in the making of this film seems to have been never make a N minute scene when you can make it a N minute scene this was a principle set right from the start with an long portrayal of the of the harvard class of the point of that scene i was to introduce some of the primary figures in the story and give a bit of their background which is somewhat effective when the of the harvard

 the london underground has something about it with its long the taking you deeper and deeper underground and of course the the a source of wonder that it is not used in films more often it was used in the raw meat featuring a tribe living in a tunnel and the chase in american in london so i was pleased to see that someone else had tried to on the atmosphere of the tube at night with the recent production 
 there is n't much to say about this film it is acting and are way far away from even decent the story of the hybrid 's is not very well explained and the whole thing has plot here and is something you would n't like to see it so that it makes me only good thing on the was in the the everything else just waste of time and money i hope will buy this this is not even worth

 i rated this a ten just because i find it so impressive what a single year old can do with a video camera it 's no but it 's plenty engaging and i was never if tens of millions of dollars can go into the bad films that are poured out en then give this director the same amount of money and see what happens i know i 'll be up at the local for her first major release damn 
 as with most of the i saw this on after watching the with my girlfriend she decided not to watch it from how bad the watched i on the other hand thought it looked weird enough to warrant a watching i mean the design of dr. alone at least a brief sweep over this title after watching it i can say that while there are some interesting aspects to it namely the over the and trying to figure out the

 things to come is an historic film along with N it stands as one of the first great science it is also one of the first movies it is remarkable how the predict the start of the second world war within a year and even in a way the year it would end in the real world but then the film from reality a world by war only substitute poison gas for nuclear weapons which of course did not exist 
 after N years of watching that nonsense called star i was feeling pretty next and were bloody good stuff and tv this opened with probably the best pilot to a show the crew were really good as were the choice of actors for the parts scott played a typical first time in deep space and his way of doing things was a change to the already know everything from before the rest of the crew were really in their roles

 this movie had terrible acting terrible plot and terrible choice of actors leslie nielsen come on the one part i considered slightly funny was the agents but because the audience was mainly kids they did n't understand that theme 
 even for the cocaine N 's this is a i do n't understand why someone would want to waste time effort money and audience brain cells to make such if your going to make a comedy make it funny if you want to film trash like this keep it to yourself if you 're going to release it as a joke like this do n't i mean it was a joke right someone please tell me this was a joke 
 this film techniques instead of landscape the attention of the camera it is small details in how someone appears how the woman may be wearing a hat and in a sheet how the husband may be wearing a hat and and shoes and his underwear and both seem so completely at ease and comfortable how the woman is posed is another feature of the that the director chooses to let us know she is a free spirit and aims to 
 this movie is the worst seen really me this movie has nothing i would not watch it again even if it were the last movie on earth great actors but bad script 
 ocean 's twelve just plain stupid bad and nothing compared to the other art N known actors at least a weak script and very slow developing idea that 's why i a movie i only saw at least N minutes of it do n't get me wrong you may like it but i only like the ocean 's films because of the theme if ocean 's N it 's not about then what 's the point to see it glad 
 i remember in florida when this movie aired i had set up my to record it the anticipation was killing me i had known about the movie ever since it was announced some half a year earlier we came back from florida N days after the movie aired and i immediately watched it i tried as hard as i could to like it but i am a huge N fan and as such i know quite a bit about them 
 horrible script which was apparently directed by no one the ca n't fend off the monster with machine guns however it backs off when a N year old girl it in the face a few times it 's supposed to be a luxury but the fancy room looks like a cafeteria in a hospital it appears that they a high school for the summer and pulled out chairs and stuff to the set with in the end shot they are 
 i did n't think it could be done but something has come along and replaced open a low budget about someone killing over the high price of real as the worst film i 've ever seen in my short but otherwise sweet was touted as the best film in montreal 's most recent film festival which leads me to believe that every other entry must consist of shots accompanied by people reading gloomy this movie was like a little of 
 i became a fan of the tv series life on the street ' late in the show 's run but became a fan very quickly it was a show unlike any other different in its use of hand-held cameras taking the everywhere with its and cast and their and and that it covered all of the good and bad of a police department including the corruption and that up to the surface the movie the to the series is as 
 what did the director think everybody who has read the of is left impressed by her to face a public rape trial in renaissance times and even suffer in order to show that was guilty that fact shows the real independence and in her most terrible hour she stands her man why do movies renaissance have to be so beautiful and romantic are we afraid to see the side of life or has the hollywood won while i would always 
 this film is the greatest film ever made in my opinion and if you have n't seen it then its worth watching i would rate this film a if you want to see more then check out the opening where the evil is killing everyone in his way is excellent his character is the best he then has to woman who finds him dying she then has to take on the that killed him which means there 's more killing 
 i first saw this film when i was about it me away then and in many it still does now but i am less inclined to see it as an accurate historical piece now there is precious little effort made to examine and with the and thus fails to that the most potent weapon is to understand it at its very core in those who commit it what we get instead is a on the one side and woods in 
 i agree with one of the other comment writers about good story & good actors but and i would also say rushed it has been about since i read the book as it was in school but i felt that you would need to know the story of when watching this one as are left out & therefore it does n't fully make sense for example & rochester have hardly spoken & suddenly he is proposing marriage the actors do 
 i might not have been the biggest blair fan but nonetheless that effort so i was looking forward to altered especially after reading the thrown around in various comments unique a future classic and so on you got wonder where people come up with that stuff to describe such a poor altered is a poor weak movie that fails to engage in any and every respect the is not funny the and is not scary and whatever thinking aspect some 
 america a land of freedom of hope and of dreams this is the nation that since its independence has to bring democracy prosperity and peace to the entire world for the good of all there are times however when one can not help but wish that the american 's would just stay on their side of the atlantic this ' and i use that word with some reservations these feelings with an intense this vision of hell follows the of 
 the original movie man from river is one of the best i 've seen nearly perfect a lady and the tramp in two rich boy and ability vs. the however is not only a attempt to capitalize on the good name of the original but also a ridiculous mess best as meets the black without the of the black the young hero comes back from a absence and suddenly he 's on in the original good film he was real 
 the brands in this film like suit supply take away from the story cause it 's supposed to be set in the it 's not a very film also the single from on the is very bad it has a chorus that is repeated numerous times ' like i 'm a man i take it all away i 'm a man i 'm here to stay could n't those have come up with something better than that i guess they 
 i turned this off within the first five minutes it 's very sick and disturbing the moment i turned this off was when the beautiful white horse was let into the and it 's was by a small instrument this was lying on the floor in a state of shock before it died the said the animal dies it did n't i do n't agree with animals or any living i was very disappointed as i had just watched without 
 this film is a perfect example of the recent crop of films that simply are not fully realized there are two routes to take in films either you do n't really explain what 's going on or who the killer is like in texas massacre or give the characters a lot of back story and so that everything is explained halloween could potentially be an example of this fails in this area i see absolutely no reason to give a 
 this movie not a film clearly recorded on a cheap may be one of the greatest in history the packaging the as an exploration of the film is not an exploration of anything and it is no more than at one 's own the script is and with all plot elements serving as between supposed sex scenes however even the sex scenes are except for the first they are around three seconds long then again maybe my version was cut 
 just as its a mad mad mad mad world is at the top of my list for all time greatest ever made this one is at the very bottom of course i could be having seen saving in other words it 's a out of

 it is so to see a movie like this with actual mood and instead of just a bunch of this is a great that has genuine along side some really great sets and performances its are but because there is very little if any there is no need to shake the camera around to hide the effects this makes the movie compared to the other # films of this that have come out in the last decade or more than 
 i should say at the outset there are many many things i love about planet ' and yes i certainly consider it a ' film for many reasons but the it has received over the years goes a bit over the top in my opinion no less an authority than leonard says planet ' is one of the most ambitious and movies of its ambitious without a doubt depends on what part of the film you 're talking about it 
 i have to say i loved point i 've seen the original and this is a pretty good of it even though it did n't follow the original that 's why i gave it N out of N it was still pretty good and this is probably a better for the car well the 's comment at the end about the going N mph into the is pretty and if you look the was at but even though i did 
 as b movies go it was well above average i warn the reader now that i may reveal certain key elements of the plot or other parts of the movie although i am trying to any such tendency as usually go it was utterly despite a approach to trying to copy certain elements from the original movie despite this sometimes tendency it seemed to work in this particular film so long as the could his attention from comparisons to the

 the film my name is is based around an episode that takes up about one page in the novel called night of the it describes an incident in which the young N in the book in the film asserts her leadership in a war over a casino as this is set before the actual her trusted is not in the film that is one of the main problems as the relationship between and was certainly always one of the aspects 
 the of this movie of a talk show host running for president as an independent just to shake things up is funny entertaining brilliant and even a bit thought about the west debate when tom leaves his thought about steven announcing his good times the first N N minutes of this movie are therefore very very entertaining the debate especially when he eventually get 's elected it 's a that is because of a computer you 'd want him to

 german has managed a task many fans thought was impossible he 's fellow for the crown of director of the worst film ever is truly the ed wood of the new this film is as and as the of i am both proud and embarrassed to say that i watched it in to see just low the bar could be set the answer is a pit and buried fun begins with the cast of international only someone who has lived 
 although is one of the movies i 've ever seen it 's a movie that should be watched closely some of the funny are done in passing and do not have the usual amount of attention drawn to them for instance keep an eye on michael 's use of the pricing gun at the pet store and also on the years that appear at the beginning of scenes it 's one of those rare movies where the humor hits you 
 this is probably the best film made since ed wood died i ca n't the ending because i have absolutely no idea what happened i 'll try my best though there are some kind of but they keep bodies so any character might or might not be the character you 're supposed to think it is or it might be a sound confusing it 's not as confusing as you might think since none of the characters make any sense 
 this is not the kind of movie that really merits critical attention it 's not going to win any it 's really not a very good movie at all it 's not even really a movie just a string of short together in an effort to make entertainment and as much as every critical bone in my body out to give this movie a failing score it i 'm going to give it a much better score the kind of 
 truly a great film i onto it at the video store and it because in the company of men and your friends and neighbors was in it as well as the lovely former model does get in the film but that is only one of the many reasons to rent it it 's very exciting and the character development is is one of the most actors working and he this film it is very dark and violent but i enjoyed 
 like with any movie there are good movies and there are bad movies if you asked me to name a good movie i 'd have dozens to choose from if you asked me to name a bad movie probably the first one to pop up in my mind is one that still has me in a sort of depression of disappointment about a week since i saw the film for the first and i promise you the last time that 
 i have in the past loved tim burton i loved ed wood edward and even attacks but i hate this movie the drama scenes in the beginning were the sort of poorly done things that used to historical drama N years ago then there were all the scenes which just left me cold and that 's the sort of thing that ought to mean something i would think yes there were some nice trees and and the jumping out of 
 when i die someone will me and if they do n't what 's the difference who gives a damn thus the philosophy of life or lack there of is up once and for all in this less than classic but nevertheless fun spinoff of 's dollars in the opening scene three obviously evil ride into a western town and with they all the normal people in their homes the will notice that each of these three bears a striking to 
 many fans complain that has in the last years i was inclined to agree with this until the influx of asian films a trend which has grown however it has produced some true and a tale of two for me at least stands out as an piece of and perhaps the best film in a very long on a korean it tells the sad story of two with their father and after experiencing a few problems on their first night 
 this movie was packed pull of endless surprises just when you thought it could n't get worse they added more and more vans with sex scenes as you can guess i was a victim of the original version we were into watching it thinking it was the host box which promised jail breaks and much more who would have thought a dollar store christmas present could have been so much fun

 where to start ok do n't compare this film to fight club for a start ridiculous if it was even a patch on fight club the violence blood etc would be much more evident and realistic this film is no football factory which is so much more real and danny makes nicholas look like an embarrassment fair enough the is quite decent and the fight scenes are well with a decent ending i might add but the film on the

 the starts off well the somewhat story is helped greatly by the two main actors and there 's a of a character study going on here but the film goes fast when ' character buys a not one of those little she buys a real big this sudden plot device basically the movie it 's just not for a woman like the one plays who has a hard time doing anything because of her father for her to out of 
 you can debate prince 's acting talent or even his choice to his own life in this film there is no debate about his musical talent either then or now he seems like a years later but the music remains relevant and having lived through the of this movie high school i can tell you that there was nothing bigger at the time from al 's wife trying to little and every thing else under the sun via the parents

 i had high hopes for this one after reading the back of the in the spirit of american pie and animal house after suffering through this i realized i just $ to rent it this movie started out slow and just got slower brief and fleeting moments of proved that it was in the spirit of american pie if you mean spirit as a dead thing not very entertaining or fun do n't be like i was and expect anything 
 it 's not just that this is a bad movie it 's not only that four of the best mexican movie makers are in this film and it 's not only that the script is terrible it 's just that this movie big time this people are money in terrible scripts it 's supposed to make a criticism about mexican society but we 're fed up with this kind of films is bad language supposed to be funny i do

 i 've read all the dave novels and consider james lee burke to be my favorite contemporary writer i 've also visited new and much of to be able to better the setting in most of these books to say i greatly anticipated seeing in the electric especially since i thought lee jones would be as was greatly disappointed the story was very the with the ghosts of dead was and lost the impact and it added to the book 
 i saw this when i was twelve it was the movie that made me understand what a good mystery really was i had read the entire happy children 's mystery series and they were about a family of child who always got their man but we the readers were not in a position to solve the mystery along with them this movie showed me that a good mystery is that which makes the at the end say oh of course 
 the box to this movie totally itself the cover shows a view of & in a short the title is ' the on the back of the box made it seem as though cat the main character was an who became one of the popular students but that popularity lead to a bizarre that she could not escape from everything that the box built this movie up to was a horrible lie i expected a sort of version of ' 
 this is the worst movie i 've ever seen boring terrible do n't waste even a minute in your life to watch this i hope the directors wo n't make any other movie because this movie them the movie seems to be created in one or two days with some friends of the directors if we can use this word for these N guys they use only camera in hand many scenes are in and nothing can be seen lots 
 i have always been keen on watching hong kong movies but all of them failed to meet my expectations until now burning does n't contain the flat humor most movies have nor a second rate story line that has been dragged into the film the story is not complex but there are never scenes that are just there to fill some space the only arts film i have seen is tiger but since hollywood is involved it is no true 
 when i first heard about this series on i have to say that out of all the shows that i have seen this one tops it all off i had to see this show and that is what i really did when i got the first volume of this show it was the best i really liked the and all the fight scenes were i have to say that my favorite characters in the show were and and of course 
 joseph h. lewis was one of the directors of film this is surely his does n't have some of the standard features of what we now call film though it is set entirely in england it lacks it lacks a it does not lack title character answers an ad she is that she 'll be making some money as a secretary instead she up days later as the pawn in a plot only a very strong person could survive such 
 of many movies dealing with great artists or a pointed out the real dilemma in which an artist is the decision whether to ease the demands of the popularity or to create something new and to define ones ' own 's desperate seek for and his led him to live the way he did and yes very drunk but still he defended and retained the most important ethical rules for an artist respect to his master respect to the nature 
 one of the more to hit the film screens a of hit boeing boeing which in turn was a of the hit of the same name the standard of in has once again proved his is one of the best stars of who can do comedy he has combined well with the new john however john still remains in and fails to rise to the new are and do complete justice to their must watch comedy leave your brains away 
 this review applies for the cut of the film that 's generally available as of the i understand there is an version out there with additional and i would hope that it contained at least eight or nine crucial scenes that seem to be missing from the cut known as of the in short the movie makes absolutely no sense it is nonsense and nonsense at that venerable portrayed by paul in a seemingly endless series of films is apparently 
 i read angels and about N years ago and i can say to is one of the few books that i could n't put down while movie however was pretty much what i expected a lot of action with somewhat of a mystery tom plays in my opinion a much better role of professor than in the wo n't have to worry about this being as bad as the code this is everything that it was n't much more interesting 
 ever since i first encountered the as a sex in lee 's she 's got have it i have been sold on the range of this yet actress she received an for her portrayal here and to say it is is a of she simply as the force and hand in her community this was especially for me for i grew up in this very same time period the production detail was and memories of life and times during the 
 this movie was disappointing after N years when it was brought back to mind from reviewing some about all the regrets i felt about the movie came rolling back while i remember peter i was entirely to the fact that the female lead she was little more than an object for discussion in the was ms. i saw this movie back in the days when i wrote movie reviews and warned people off it as the stories just did n't 
 if one sits down to watch it is probably because its advertisements video boxes whatever that it was banned in the for over N years as virtually every video nasty does it 's true and people and draws them in with their promise of controversy being an fan however none of this was new to me the advertisements that that the film was banned in the do n't necessarily make me want to watch it in fact the first thing 
 what is he supposed to be he was a kid in the past and the future this movie had a lot of problems is he a ghost or just a strong kid man what a piece of i 'm still confused also is he supposed to be an abortion strange very strange this movie will mess with your mind and it 's not very scary just confusing why was he where did what was the oh who is n't worth 
 a made for television version of the heart of seemed like a good way to add more insight to the book well that was the wrong assumption the movie made it even worse i was highly disappointed about almost everything in the movie i hoped that the movie would possibly help put the pieces of the book together that i did n't but it did no such thing it still left me confused and hanging it is one of those 
 the lion king N is a very story to go along with the lion king it basically follows the original story of the lion king but with a couple of in the movie e are explained by a different characters point of view this story is still an original far as go disney is n't all that great at making ones this one being the third part to the lion king 's pride is the second actually has an original 
 having read most of the comments i feel like i have a word to say as me most is that most people here are think that this movie is either pro or con to the subject of death penalty and whether it worked with them i remember having read an article back in N when the film was published yes it has interested me so much ever since i heard that it would come out that i have not forgotten 
 having reviewed N of the N and i thought i would get them all done now army is my all time it ai n't half hot is also a classic as is you i do n't regard de as a classic but it is still 's about a holiday camp similar to but instead of red coats it 's yellow coats it is ran by a well meaning man but has the of a the staff include fun entertainment manager 
 drawing restraint N is a kind of movie one either or fortunately or not i left it with a strong feeling of wasted time and of being with killing is bad propaganda the movie could have been especially its first half until it is not clear that every action portrayed serves as an of various aspects of hunting until then it might be slightly amusing to look at daily chores of japan workers but later it becomes obvious that anything 
 N years later and this movie still has of its floating around never has a movie valley girl 's incredible the movie completely the N 's to such a perfect degree that it could only be realized this many years later at his best a movie that just has so much character to it that it makes you realize how sad hollywood has become as far as quality goes the special edition is loaded with tons of and well worth 
 i love the although i do have problems fully understanding the stories the style is unique with all its dust and so i thought i knew what i was up for surprisingly i understood the main plot but some extremely poorly decisions where made for its style i mean really bad looking human actors close ups why it did not work at all and the other was successfully made in and very close to the comic version i think with 
 take your video camera turn out all the lights in your house and film people running around with for an hour and a half and you 've got the basic idea of what this film looks like it is very to watch this kind of movie to be fair there are scenes of at the very beginning and very end of the movie i like scary movies and features but this one just did n't do a thing for me 
 on the contrary to the person listed above me i felt that this movie was really funny particularly in the scenes were there is a lot of mix up i do n't want to give the plot and the away to the people that have n't watched it yet but i will say that does not have an extensive role such as past movies for example and does an amazing part in the little role given to him john does 
 there no doubt in one that this movie is stupid and joke but tell the truth it is quite entertaining if you first time and try not to anything over all the movie have a very good ideas but badly story of the two losers up to find out that they ca n't remember what happen to them the day before only to find out later that they are after by the angry girl friends aliens aliens and some gangs 
 tiny almost finds the of his characters and makes something enormous out of it in front and behind the camera he creates one of the most uncomfortable i had the pleasure to see and see and see again it never let 's me down people even people who know me pretty well there something wrong with me based on my attraction or i should say for they may be right i do n't know but there is something within 's 
 nice even though it did n't work out how you wanted with the original film you have a piece of work and great is evident how much you put into goes for everyone else too it 's great to see the and all account of the process without being it well worth a the writer of original ' film could n't appreciate what you have the attitude too great piece looking forward to seeing the next going

 this story is a familiar one in the tom and jerry especially in the the only difference being that two instead of one are threatened to be if they do n't catch the mouse jerry tom has an buddy living in the house with him so this really two shoes who ca n't believe that they have a mouse despite two in the the one who jerry can stay while the other gets the so the competition is on even

 this film was but for the wrong reasons the of the action are and make the film have some funny stick moments robert and fred have a scene together near the end where says to you sure do get around buddy boy i did enjoy this film only for and but not for the that must have been written on the back of a in four lines and the rest most likely a film with over N parts only has 
 men in black N was a real disappointment for me while the actors did a pretty good job especially smith there just is n't a cure for a poor script once in production the movie really had a kind of feel playing off partial events of the first film the story was in a word bad at best it was n't thought out well and seemed very and at the first the organization had a kind of elite force feel 
 and this beautiful film is the now without slow in pace quiet in mood it gives good of the of earth that may well be signs of an inevitable is no doubt in my mind the nature is plagued and we are the disease greed the very of that drives evolution and progress has turned us into something like cancer on its way to consume the host and die with it manufactured is quite an experience at least i 'll

 a mexican gold from a along with some other and americans the americans the and leave them all for dead the one and looks for in this film that has to do with the original the distributors only named it kill to squeeze a few more out of more people what we have here is a slightly below standard western that 's too to be that and as such i ca n't really recommend it to all but the most 
 i would have to disagree strongly with the previous comment i watched this not expecting too much from it the fact is that the cast were especially the lead female the dark sides of them all came through all were up in an not obvious way there was an underlying current which ran through the movie of and the serial killer role was played well also as you could feel he had gone through what they had as children what

 i this movie without having heard or read anything about it what a shame this movie is and ridiculous the characters manage to get developed without relying too heavily on tired it was to watch i could n't help thinking that marketing would have helped this movie into the mainstream the quality of the dialogue and the ease with which the actors execute a huge range of and comedy is so rare these days i felt that the actors must 
 great little i was expecting some type of silly movie but what i got was tight short that waste none of our time these movies we have to get into the back characters stories so we will either feel for them or when people start getting killed such here yes you see a few characters but they really only with the principals such as the husband wife at the motel whose room was canceled we saw them so we could 
 i watched this that it was the that was released in i seriously regret an hour of my life sitting through it shame on whoever gave this junk an award i this fact i did n't see it through to the end after an hour i could no longer stand it i am that people are by such a tries and fails to off a dozen other human interest stories and such acting painful i rate it N star out 
 is a original romantic comedy that pits the greatest and scientific minds of the century as 's the of heart and mind is the central theme of this yet movie you do n't quite know how to react because part of the time you are seeing great scientists do silly things to love but at other times you hear them discuss some of the of of our age the end result is a fun movie with surprises throughout walter is 
 i 'm not a regular of 's but i do watch his show in and i think the show is a fine guilty pleasure and a good way to kill some time so naturally i 'm going to watch this movie expecting to see jerry first of all jerry appears in approximately minutes of the film 's running time the other hour and minutes is spent building up this about incest and who looks hot as is a who with 
 although i 'm this of N 's italian features in the recently released experience box set and although it 's also available on under the misleading and stupid title escape from death row i think it deserves a proper and edition completely in its originally spoken with options the is truly horrible restored picture quality and a of special bonus features i do n't even need the restored picture quality and bonus features if only we could watch the film 
 a of and ghost starts very promising then down to almost boring contains some special effects they were able to make in the N 's the story is intriguing but becomes quite lack in the end it was rated r because of the sex and may 's and naked beauty is very apparent through out the whole movie a bizarre movie and cost a lot by the time it was made this could have been a bigger classic with a 
 when i first saw a of this movie i quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of ball york 's portrayal of is absolutely awful ball was an with incredible talent to think about a like ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is i can not believe out of all the in the world who could play a much better the producers decided to get york she might be a good actress in other

 there are movies and there are films movies are more often than not merely candy films are true works of art is certainly in the latter as most viewers i was highly impressed with the battle scenes but the of the portrayal of the central character is what i consider to be the most sterling quality of the film having done everything possible to serve her country as a true daughter of all the while in the of die is

 this is the best of the N films that werner made his most successful at least he was one of the leading directors in the new germany after was as the cold maria who lost her husband to the war found him after she took an american as a lost him again after he went to jail for her and found him at the end her day and a half marriage before he disappeared was longer than their time together

 they should have called this movie adopted mouse brother that is slightly inspired by someone 's vague of stuart little who just kind of the book a little but mostly just remembered the cover if it was n't so misleading i 'd give it a better seriously people do your kids a favor and have them read the book they might actually learn something instead of having their mind by what we all know as hollywood book stuart little is 
 i am a student of film and have been for several years and the concept of a had me wondering is this the film that 's going to break the let 's face it america has never been let down by any piece of that features a after such great as trouble and checks in i thought that the best ideas were already taken but then comes i i i contemplated i 've read about in the but that still 
 i 'll with the usual comparisons to a certain legendary known for his new yorker because quite frankly to draw comparisons with loser is just an to any such director i will also avoid the office space ' in the same breath as this catastrophe i can however compare it to up during your own surgery it 's painful to watch and you wonder whether the really know what they 're doing tunnel is the kind of film you wish 
 and all through the house is a special episode not only because it 's from the first season but this episode was the first one i saw i remember as a young man being on vacation with my parents that summer in N in our hotel room in south carolina on hbo i saw this episode and i was buried to the right then and forever i had always been a fan of series and liked monster movies and with

 the comparison is perhaps unfair but inevitable those attracted to the and of will be slightly to discover a musical in the american style dialogue with numbers gene kelly 's french was apparently so poor that a job of was as you 'll remember the was almost perfectly pulled off in the translation of the french for versions as well leaves something to be although this ca n't be attributed to the film also has several moments that come off

 i know my title i could n't think of any other title x ice is a brilliant first season episode very interesting idea and good acting as well the whole was really in my opinion i 've never been a fan of so all the episodes are to me x anyway lets go on to the good and bad things about this episode the good the thing finally was a good idea to put another in the though if someone 
 an exploration of reality although it is not yet clear how much the director himself intended this film deliberately takes you through several of reality leaving only clues about which layer of reality you are in an confusion for the to also can be seen as a of video games the whole movie though may fall into the of form here it seems unable to escape from the video game which it thus the becomes a number of interesting ideas 
 this is one amazing movie you have to realize that chinese is complicated and there are always stories behind stories i myself did not understand everything but knowing chinese i studied them in school it is very complicated you just have to take what it gives you enjoy the movie and enjoy the ride 
 mention to anyone with a slight with the and the images usually up are of over the top musical numbers with that makes vegas seem a of this perception is not helped by the of that most movies that have approached from an outsider 's perspective 's romantic comedy however takes a different it is not a look at those silly people and their but a appreciation of for its its lack of irony and is obvious that the director

 i loved this show when it aired on television and was crushed when i found out that someone somewhere decided that it was n't worthy of being continued for years i hung onto my copies of this show ones that i had taped or had someone tape for me that is until now the powers that be finally decided to release this beautiful series on and i finally was able to get my eager little hands on the complete set 
 was awful but it may have given the idea to it better more like tap than anything else the film is from the start surprising anyone who saw it back in the the performances are played for but not so much so that they are characters more like brothers these guys are real and slightly diverse they react to situations like any of us might well we may not throw a when our performance hats are late to the or 
 this is one of the worst action films i have ever seen this is particularly due to much of the like an obvious agent as a bank loan officer while making obvious that he is speaking to someone through a wire or the scene where the scientists assume it is safe to enter a room in which a virus has been released even though has not found a viable host ' does not mean that it will never find one

 i have done some research on ed and i have found a few interesting things like the fact that ed was quiet and a not some over bearing as in this movie i will say that i did n't finish this movie but i will i will through the fact that all of us talk like we are from you know the funny but oh so sad factor in this movie is wisconsin is n't as hot as they made 
 why is there so much among the who hate this film it is n't a but having viewed it twice it does come across as compelling drama set in the world of network tv robin stone is the of every dan rather stone and brian on nbc a of a man of love who succeeds but fails in his personal life i worked for eight N years in network news and robin stone 's do exist the supporting cast works

 i have to agree with everyone else that has watched it quite a while ago but i 'll tell you whenever i hear certain music from this i am reminded of the story the beautiful the characters and the feeling i got when watching it and it does make me cry such a happy yet sad feeling i do however find that the love story in it felt rushed and they did n't explain things properly but it did n't

 jazz will this classic short showing some of the best men of jazz just doing their thing it 's like watching a no music video jazz men give us an additional treat in the person of bryant who a classic version of on the side of the street i had never heard her before bryant sounds like that 's a instrumental work is tops as well with the black of its time fed a lot of white this film is 
 i do n't see what the problem is with some people and their need for intellectual humor you need to get your head out of your if you do n't find this movie if this is n't your cup of tea so to speak then look at it for what it truly a damn funny movie maybe they did set out to make yet another & a movie but in this case they 've truly hit the spot it 's 
 there is no way to avoid a comparison between the cat in the hat and the who christmas so let 's get that part out of the way first of all let me start by saying that i think was an and film cat was well just was cast because he is a brilliant physical and to over the top characters mike fell back on his old bag of why why mike the kids could care less and the austin 
 's ' is a film in itself it is nothing like the book which may its yet viewed on it 's own the film is a the views are spectacular and the acting is n't too bad either was different from his usual action hero type characters cruz is and really holds the film together i think that this film has to be as an related to the book louis de gave up rights to the film script so the 
 my only regret is that one can not grade a movie on with a a would definitely deserve that at the movie starts with a bunch of people entering a to an ancient when a guy cuts himself and his blood and falls onto the and that is supposed to be a the takes place and the in an effect would you believe it quickly takes on a more human form only to reveal that he 's wearing a and 
 when is on a roll he 's in my N wives he 's not on a roll the timing of the is off but they 're the best thing going for the movie the five women who play the wives do n't add up to one whole actress between them the plot is very weak even the is pretty weak there are a few jokes about having multiple wives but the situation has little to do with anything else in 
 its a space or at least i think it is you got female in a space prison and a monster on a space station using a virus to through its the acting is so bad that space looks like an award winning film the story is simple space prisoner gets chance to reduce sentence by investigating a space station that lost contact with she finds a doctor with women and a angry of she fights them so on and so 
 what a i was checking this out hoping it would be an james and what a it turned out to be the production quality was fine but the plot was and i can say that i am only a couple hours older and a lot now the movie really had no and if this kind of stuff keeps coming out it will give a bad name for those of you who insist on knowing what it was about it 's

 actually i have more a question than a comment i loved and the of saw first then the and while i loved the story i am as to why in the movie was an important character but in the he was n't part of the team and only merely mentioned as just some kid they knew does anyone know the story on that the story of these boys was amazing i never experienced the craze where i grew up but 
 the scientist charles and his wife or assistant receive some and a from an ancient indian cemetery and while cleaning a they are attacked and murdered by a being the man then a military by michael seeks out two groups of four soldiers each that in the they face the man shooting him while he each then the man goes to a power plant and the facility destroying the bought man on expecting to see a funny trash but i 
 this eye special was by complaints more on that later when it was broadcast in N following a national debate around a possible s law following the and murder of school girl in fact it s scheduling was delayed while phil collins took legal advice after he found out he d been by the show s maker chris morris into a starting a campaign entitled truth be told this show is probably more remembered for the controversy than the content 
 this movie was excellent for the following reasons N it contained great and sets N it showed the of a environment alongside a technological one N john 's acting was he portrayed very well N it showed the of everyone in a situation N it gave us a picture of what might happen in the future in many i was also impressed with the acting for the most part 's acting was i found the most the and values of 
 this movie does the first one as far as the of the care bears and the care bear goes i wo n't deny that however if you look at part ii as a separate film then it 's a very good movie i remember watching this in the early N 's and into its targeted audience then and absolutely it much more than the first movie not that i did n't enjoy that one too it 's just that this 
 i did n't know what to make of this film i guess that is what it was all about really i have never seen a film like it and i doubt that i really ever will again puts together something that is unique to him i think to appreciate it you have to read some of his maybe see one of his slide shows i really like this guy he is just so bizarre i ca n't help it note 
 i had seen this movie before but i could not remember it was this it has a fun plot around the city with etc causing a and the music is just perfect and the happy ending that girl is a great choice for a like me in my opinion this could be even the best movie i have ever seen 
 imagine every from every movie and tv show set on the streets of brooklyn between N and it with a cast of instead of actual characters throw in a mix of period music and electric during the scenes then pass the time trying to figure out or care which of the is going to be killed in the final 'll give this movie points for not being just another romantic comedy explosive action movie sex comedy musical or vehicle but 
 the was rather interesting but the characters were rather flat and at times too extreme in their more extreme than necessary also i think something went wrong in the casting john does n't really satisfy me playing a player not to speak of the italian player were n't very much outlined either 
 while the and dance numbers in general are n't as strong as many would have them be the film 's and message are still there and ring out above the simple musical numbers keeping in mind that this film was made after the hollywood musical had nearly died out with few exceptions being rock the audiences that went to see it new did n't appreciate the fact that it was a attempt at something that had n't been done to 
 truly i love as well yes never she was as ridiculous as as was the film of secrets of the both just completely missed the point russell was is and always will be the first and only perhaps as a young ball could have pulled off a role like this where her inherent beauty and youth could have carried her through but this seemed a desperate attempt from an aged star to show that she was still viable in the 
 does anyone know the exact quote about time and love by george father in the move it had to be you he was talking to charlie and in the church as they were leaving if not i will have to rent the movie this was a great movie i also loved great love story for the soul i met my one true love my and although i had the experience to meet him when i had least expecting it i 
 the N 's tv series owes it 's idea from this movie this is the movie that stewart & kim made right after they were cast together in by alfred this one is not as as that one but is just as was jack movie and he is good in support here as well as the movie has a lot of good things about it is very good in this movie almost as good in support here as she was 
 can anybody tell me where is the comedy charlie is a very weak thomas church is looking so with him and the whole thing is so they tried to make a live comic book which turned out to be bloody comic nightmare and it was n't even funny like the plan 's scene in the it was so good with its but there is nothing more except pain donald his relationship with his daughter this is actually a kind of

 let 's get it clear from the start i am an with the emotional of cubic stone therefore i consider of people with disabilities social or whatever they have and cry on and on about it as stupid movies with poor taste i mean if you have a message you can tell it without the help of sick or i liked this movie it is about people with incredible bad luck as personal health goes but they do n't cry 
 this belgian film directed by tom singer of the well-known group will not be by everyone for the simple reason that there is n't a clear story or even a plot this movie just shows N hours in a city here and allows you to watch and truly enjoy the the the the bruno and paul are several scenes the on the beach the dance party at the end the visits the clearly some other viewers did n't understand what 
 reading some of the comments on the message boards here i was expecting this movie to be a complete but when i watched it i could not stop laughing it has officially become my new do n't know what all the hate here is about maybe it 's because a movie of this kind has never really been around before i am at a loss to name another completely female driven comedy plenty of will have one or two in 
 although a woman 's story i found this still fairly interesting it is unusual in that is has three playing in the movie i am referring to and national critics loved this movie was the presence of john in their minds characters are but life types like played here are people they can identify with despite that this movie still has an overall feeling of which is why i liked it some of the characters may have done stupid things 
 an old family story told to two young by their is brought to life N years later as he are getting murdered and blood is being and are all over and naked bodies are being barbara is the suspect but we know she is not the killer is it marina is it back from death for is it a plot to steal an the color is in this from who only did one other as far as i only thing 
 like wearing a hair absolutely without a shadow of a doubt one of the worst movies ever pure zero stars out of ten one long theatrical and scene after another intended to be and the soul it is instead father and son and to each other like is the point loud and clear ok so what repeated more than once by the son is the line supposedly lifted from lives of the a father 's love a son lets himself 
 this is exactly the sort of film that could incorrectly convince the that films from this time period are and they are not it 's just that this particular film is because while the film tries very hard to be and adult it also is so old and that i was torn between laughing at the film or just falling this is a unique combination to say the why exactly did i hate it so much well the film is 
 the original title means the birth of the i must that i do not quite understand this title the english title is water but after having written this i read the comment by another user the title in french is also or suggest an individual having to many pressures simultaneously thanks for your basic theme is the first sexual of when it is not clear if they are directed toward the same or the other sex it is no different 
 i enjoyed 's novel when it came out and was when i saw the for this film and even more so when i found that had directed it himself the film however was a major the are nowhere near the rich and of the original and the story is poorly told seems to have chosen to focus on the more aspects of the novel and he does n't do a very good job at it most part of the original 
 somehow lost out in the to my brother jack the latter a high-quality of george johnston 's novel was outstanding but in my opinion not as good as i have heard that many critics dismissed as being irrelevant historically inaccurate or even who and where are these critics is outstanding more than that brilliant it 's not supposed to be a certainly i can the actual or indeed any of a camp for being disappointed with the production but to 
 hunt for justice is about the of for his trial in the while it was a little too clinical in presentation the subject matter could have gotten very very quickly a canadian judge becomes the chief war crimes prosecutor at the international criminal for the in she everyone to pull out the evidence that sent to trial not a bad with class a and production work the ' was disturbing by the discussion of the facts they did n't go 
 this film is the most romantic in years david is make you cry and dream driver and james are very good too but david is miss the opportunity to see this little film and fall in love with bob and grace run walk 
 a young cat tries to steal back his brothers soul from death but only gets half of it and then has to go to get the other half or maybe not frankly i 'm not sure what happens in this film which is full of very strange very images some of which parents might find disturbing off part of a who is traveling with them and the it like which all three eat is a very strange film that some 
 well not much really to say about this but it is really good very good job from and the movie have good cast of acting movies plot is also and good so the good is main word in this case i just hope there would be more this kind movies why this one s pointed out in the crowd i give it of N 
 has to be one of the most beautiful films i have ever it 's extremely grim and at times so fans of politically correct mainstream garbage should n't film many wonderful with plenty of and is extremely odd vicious and disturbing so fans of bizarre wo n't be disappointed my segment from is human which shows us a relationship between a young man and his pregnant scene is particularly nasty and not easily last segment right has to be seen 
 this movie should be called plan N from joseph smith i think its is the playwright seems to have read paul ehrlich 's the population bomb N and a musical response made especially for the whole point of the play is that having as many children as you can is part of father 's god 's plan and anything that stands in the way of having more is very bad get it this version was in N which is confusing 
 the of this film falls on judgments by police officers who fortunately ethical and moral men act on situations within situations in a city with a of violence and killing good compound story lines and 
 all i can say after watching the of the first season is that i can not believe nbc this show it 's so different than what 's currently in save for lost those who miss the just may have a worthy successor not as or intense as lost i find it to be overall more kind of extended story is hard to make i mean it could into if most of the elements do not together but they do and 
 certainly one of the most films of all time excellent original music it 's hard to be about something this good there is n't one character that you do n't instantly love to there 's trouble in the black room my name is the lines thrown away left and right are themselves any comedy whose is not of the variety called you my organization is where 's 's in my head ' they do n't sound brilliant until you hear 
 i was in physical pain watching the eyes of the cast as they participated in this bad dialogue worse worst acting all the way and the cast knew it the two preceding movies which this attempted to copy had life and were 
 is a that keeps you captured for the whole and what i would say to be his best performance film has everything that you would ask for in an it has plenty of blood and a bad buy moments of but most a very good story line with plenty of is constant action throughout the film with and effects fighting movement is film is in my opinion a must see cool solid appearance makes this film and i ca n't

 before i give lee 's mess of a film summer of sam a i would like to make one thing clear i do not this film simply for its of and images what makes this film so is the fact that lee seems to believe that summer of sam should be taken seriously as a drama the crime films of for example are filled with violence and other but are nonetheless highly because does not attempt to pass these films 
 it 's obvious that all of the good reviews posted for this movie so far are from insiders who were either involved with the film or who know somebody who knows somebody and have thus seen multiple cuts well i do n't know anyone involved and i 've seen the final cut and it is pure garbage the only thing it has going for it is and multiple from none on screen for long it 's as if the made 
 this movie is horrible everything in it has been done before there is nothing original i can not stand when writers do n't come up with their own girl makes a wish on her birthday and up as an adult sounds a lot like a movie in the called big what is even more is 's acting she does n't act like she is N she just acts like she is then on you can guess the whole plot she 
 in some ways the concept behind the was a rather interesting of several typical movie types in an interesting combination however no point in this movie was so obvious that it did not deserve shots i felt as though i had been beat over the head with the so-called explanation for the disease killing writer appears to have simply lifted from other movies as a substitute for writing lines adapted to actual characters the actors did not help matters no 
 how on earth were these guys given funds to make this movie the lack of script is one thing but the makes you want to a hand held camera can be of great value to the look and feel of a movie but in that case you need a who knows what he is doing i am well aware that the actors are but it 's of no since the director might be the least one ever in sweden it 
 what a great this is it 's an unusual story that is fun to watch yes it has but it is very into the story and is very to hear it was so to watch i enjoyed it from start to finish the movie takes place in england during world war ii it is about an who is searching for a missing portion of a that she needs she uses her rough magic to transport her and N children under 
 i went to see it in hopes of some good old alice i realized i would not be getting that i watched it for a pretty well made movie in terms of and that was it aside from it having a good film quality considering i had been watching movies all day long there was nothing good about that killed were and played by and who can answer that for me who can answer anything awful about this movie for 
 some people may remember ms. russell from films such as black widow which had some appeal and critical boy she must have really needed a rent check when she signed on to do this there will be those who like the violence and but one must sit back and wonder in what anyone to spend money and time to make this in the first place i just saw this movie on one of the hbo 's and i ca n't 
 one should have the right to expect from people who make a film about the second coming and the third that they had read the other two or at least knew a little more about them than and day this film contains absolutely nothing of for viewers who are interested in or philosophy there is only the standard british social with and characters in good candidates for a real third have been published several times like a course in or 
 for a movie that gained so much recognition and this spinoff to baby is one big mistake it starts off that whatever his name is because he 's so confused that he does n't know who he is anymore runs away from a with his mother and soon is by a strange lady that ends up taking care of him as if she were his mother the acting is terrible as andrew grows up in his and looks terrible with 
 good performances ca n't save this terrible script with every in the book both main characters are deeply and the scene where 's character about sex with her dead husband in front of her son which i think is supposed to be is just 
 in what appears an attempt to mix drama and comedy manuel made this film that make life it is not an original discovery by many voice you have quite off the pitch by the way but it somewhat from the in the spanish the downside is that the elements forming the film are poorly combined and while some points are not well developed others are out of place a day in the lives of two people close to the median 
 in my opinion this is an absolutely romantic disney if you ask me the voice of la was truly you 'll have to see the movie if you want to know why on the other hand despite the fact that she did a lot of voice of stanley was a very beautiful lady to me the was beautiful the cast was well chosen and the writing was strong before i wrap this up i 'd like to say that everyone 
 undoubtedly the best heavy metal item made in the ' N 's which does n't sound like much considering how utterly many other in this odd little film like hard rock blood tracks on tour and the especially nightmare to be that aside this one still deserves for the excessive and flashy special in favor of focusing on high school characters who are with greater and than the for a 's moreover the film 's pointed of both N 's 
 i like movies about morally corrupt characters but this was too much the acting was n't great but that was n't the real problem the issue was the sinking feeling i got in the pit of my about N minutes into the film these characters were they had almost no and what little they did have was devoted to the they displayed to each other in the of friendship exploring the sides of a set of characters can be but 
 dies on her day when an ice of an without wings falls on her off the back of a truck and her she is then tries to the relationship of her with his new girlfriend a who can see movie would n't be bad in a sort of way except that 's character is and that she all of the fun out of the film its like having your with to be fair nor anyone else in the cast or 
 with no any type of and a healthy appreciation of i can say i was angry at myself for to sit through the entire length of N dates i wo n't waste your time with the plot you may read other reviews i will say though that 's was extremely you either he 'd lay off the coffee or some and it 's potentially apparent to himself that this film was a bad idea as parts of it details his 
 this is a below average with the everyone in the living room routine charlie chan is a secret service agent doing government work and he must find who killed a scientist working on a bomb to defeat german in world war two there is little to recommend with this movie since the neither the bomb nor the scientist nor the war have much to do with the plot charlie chan fans will most likely find this movie disappointing who who 
 possible seldom does one see so many fine & character actors almost entirely to be precise in one film even though a few only appear for each one is a the british do this mix of comedy and better than anyone imo so it is no surprise that most of the actors are music is great no doubt much had to be dubbed does leslie really play the bass so well maybe who knew but lane was herself her warm 
 i am from texas and my family a couple of years ago to fe with my brother he suggested we go to see the church with the i was absolutely away by the that took place there the movie is great barbara and william were perfect for the parts they played it is amazing absolutely amazing if you have not seen the in person it is worth the trip to go see it the wood is beautiful and the architecture 
 this movie started out good i felt like i was watching an adult version of much to quickly i started questioning the situations and actions of the main characters and found no answers to why they were doing what they were doing all the acting was but only a few scenes had brief moments where they were actually funny dan was amazing i loved him in this role his agent should show this movie to casting agents watch the first 
 although the actors were good specially as the blind lilly the film script is and completely a famous theatre director becoming blind after a car accident is on the run for himself and his lilly being since her birth is teacher for blind persons and wants to make him seeing again blind persons are seeing with their fingers nose and here this movie is becoming a and the longer the road becomes the closer their develops which was predictable since

 i have seen just about all of 's films and they are all beautiful and but this one rises above the rest this movie totally impressed me i fell in love with and and their sweet friendship they were what made the movie for me of course the is also and the music the feelings in the film perfectly but the characters are the point in this movie they are so well developed and full of let me clarify i 
 i liked this movie because it told a very interesting story about living in a totally different world at the south susan is such a good actor that she made an interesting strong character out of writing the true story displays a devastating situation for her character to overcome 
 yet an examination of the different of two college a but star basketball player and a we never learn why these young men are friends they may share about the world and their places in it but they do n't seem to have anything else in common making his debut jack who also the with based upon 's book does n't introduce us to the characters with any nor he does shape the scenes to help us identify with anyone 
 the to this movie was one which focused on the of of in the united states this was a highly scenario in america two entirely different what justified such actions anyway as this film presents the scene while and smith these two men were not nor were they under any kind of influence of drugs it was a clear cut case of cold and calculated basically these violent acts were the end result of emotional and social anytime past N 
 this movie surprised me some things were and some technological elements reminded me of the movie enemy of the state will smith but for the most part very good mix with jamie and mike and the N and providing some comic relief this is a movie you can watch over some wednesday night when nothing else is on i gave it a N for entertainment value 
 because that 's what hell ride pretty much is larry and on the 's money with the promise to deliver a movie sometime down the line i 'm all for fake and as much as the next guy but did we really need the movie really there 's nothing worse than the of an old trend and i 'm not even talking about N 's because hell ride has none of the raw and feel of the era it to

 a wonderful to black and white films of folks like lang carl and others allen plays a character caught in a nightmare at first thinking he is part of a group trying to catch a killer and slowly that he might be a suspect the writing is a little forced this is after all allen trying to be a but the point is made and no harm done the is interesting about N of gray but make sure you watch 
 for some reason i always enjoy movies that people hate when i really do n't think they 're that bad and this is one of those films in the case of this movie i think it is way too i really is n't that bad of a film at all in fact i think this is one of the better halloween the of michael begins on the night before halloween where michael jamie lloyd who was taken by the man 
 if you 're a child of the like me you probably remember this N disney movie one of disney 's first films and michael j. fox 's screen debut i can remember watching this film over and over on hbo when i was on middle school and i only recently found a very old copy of it since disney stopped producing the movie several years ago to say this is a real fun movie to watch five college teams clues 
 i am not a very good writer so i 'll keep this short world at war is the best that i 've seen i 've seen different not only american and this seems to be the most complete that i 've seen i think it could talk a bit more about the great depression and got to power but it does a very good job at covering the war it seems to be complete and to everyone it does not 
 this starts off in pennsylvania in a bunch of kids are killed in a mine explosion set off by the mine 's owner cut to recently karen her daughter and little girl move to a house located near that mine what they do n't know is the ghosts of the little kids the woods and kill anyone who 's around after and boring movie the is obvious and has been done to death already also there are huge in logic 
 after N which i am still in about i thought is was impossible to make a that could make me cry because it was so bad i was wrong i loved the original however this movie is inaccurate with computer details and details about the original movie the original at least had some that worked whoever wrote this movie knew nothing about computers except how to use a word i doubt he or she even watched the original movie the 
 well i like this movie first of all because it 's very well thought of and well because the director and others chose an extremely great actor to play mike and also my last reason because my opinion wood is so so hot 
 surprisingly good early effort from alfred one of the only original written by himself this film shows remarkable story structure it off with a match in which carnival one round jack loses to a from the audience who happens to be a professional the movie then down to develop the characters and introduce a love between jack his girl and the professional the rest of the film is a dramatic buildup to the between the two men this time for 
 i guess i 've seen worse films but that may be i 'm so by how standard these bad movies are the killer monster thing is really really bad basically its a guy in some kind of green body suit there is much worse acting as far as b movie go but do n't think for a second this was anything hell no it actually did have a plot with substance but was still pretty stupid basically its just a 
 a film and crude the acting of anne and is so to that of and in the original version they have to be seen to be believed there was no reason to make this picture which only how accomplished and brilliant was and how also there 's a creeping pervasive in the film that is n't there in the first film 's was scary and but one could feel for all concerned even the norman bates there were moments of 
 the day time ended is an incredible picture in some ways it 's better than close of the third kind i prefer independent to big budget the special effects are but that 's a big part of the fun jim davis gives an excellent performance in this film it 's probably one of the best roles he ever had in a feature the musical score is very good the story does n't make sense but that only makes it all 
 another detailed work on the subject by takes us back in time to chose a difficult subject for his movie debut he has worked on all details to bring the story to life the treatment of the subject is very though we have not been to the region during that time the sets and look real unlike most movies made on this one focuses not on the details of violence to attract audience but on its the characters come to 
 if you like to watch movies because they are pretty you should be with this one if you like to watch movies that start out with a good guy trying to catch a bad guy then reveal clues to the of each throughout the movie it at the end of the movie i still did n't know why killed the women the way he did when you set up such a serial killer it would be nice to know where 
 i just came from seeing this movie and decided to see what others thought of it i 'm left wondering if these people who give reviews saw the same film this is potentially a very good story but it fails to hit the mark the script is very weak the plot has so many that it would make a great dip net for the fishing scenes the characters were not well developed and the around so much that i found 
 i have nothing more to say but it was awful i can not imagine why and others were part of this mess and if certain actors do n't want people to question their then perhaps they should from making more of these films there was at least one seen that left me just my opinion to think what was going on that was cut from the film to wonder what went through the minds of the actors who made this 
 i enjoyed every moment of this beautiful film and was about this female i had never heard of before so i set out exploring her life and work as could be expected i found out that the film was not exactly historically accurate i was a little however by the very negative comments on the film because of this come on guys a film is n't and should n't be a nor a novel any historical film reality because it 
 this was a very movie about however unlike 's agreement that also deals with the movie has aged well and does n't seem in other words it deals with the topic without or by today 's plays one of the most characters as he a guy to death just because he 's jewish robert plays the investigator trying to get to the bottom of this give the movie for its and look at hate it is in many ways an 
 now this is a movie i really dislike it 's one of the most boring movies from the N 's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere the are not even attractive for the eye and do not serve for the movie 's purpose the look really not in a good way like in the master N 's what did they do to our favorite toys the story is not interesting and never really explains the 
 this is another one of 's highest rated movies and so this is a tale of two men who meet on a train and exchange murder one of them robert walker takes it seriously and this leads guy to trouble with the law another fast moving movie with lots of great scenes the scene and the tennis match are worthy of not a movie to be it is a shame that no one will this on with of just a 
 and are back but the magic of the first film has the story line is just awful i mean really south african diplomats the into the u.s. it 's just painful and the are absolutely can no one get an south african right or will we forever hear the british or americans making them sound like the only guy who got the right was tim in catch a fire another thing about this movie that i was when danny so 
 i just love this 's so funny and is such a and interesting character i love 's the thing that makes this show what it is although and are so funny and about this show is great for me because it always manages to make me no matter if it 's only once an 's just so funny and all the characters are so and cool it makes the show worth the time to watch unlike some on disney this 
 man are you serious did you read the book or watch this movie well if you did let me warn you it is mark has been seeking a job since losing his job with the you remember him do n't you he was the guy that on the stand and gave the simpson defense a they were looking for well he has written three books since then i have read all three of them no i am not a fan 
 and i never thought a movie to be awarded a N but this one is the worst movie i 've ever watched my wife picked it up because of the cast but the right since the box seemed quite predictable it is not a mystery nor a film it does not include any if that 's what the title could have suggest any of you this is just a total do n't waste your time or money unless you feel 
 this is a very funny comedy about a community in central london who through an unusual set of circumstances discover they are not english but are an of the french province of film features comic actor stanley best known as alfred in my fair lady as well as a host of other classic comic actors of the story was apparently based on a news item at the time when the canadian government officially gave a hotel room to a visiting 
 this movie was an wants more from life than the approved conventional success what makes it work so well and makes it so different from the standard dance movie is that it really is n't about becoming great it is simply about finding a way to express one 's the big at the end is not the winning of a contest not the discovery of a whole new life style but the simple of doing what you want to fulfill 
 this movie everything out there well depends on what you are looking for it could be a N or a N on the scale this movie is in a complete league of its own i do n't think any movie could possibly come close to it i am not sure what the director intended to make it as a or a comedy if he did think he was making a then he has by a of luck created one of 
 first of all the whole idea of a classic such as is nothing short of lot of time and effort was wasted am sure they are smart enough to know that they could not improve on the original so they must have had a to alfred on their the idea that began as a well results in being a in the face to the movie is poorly produced poorly acted and unnecessary to begin original classic stands well on it 
 is definitely my most favorite movie i 've more than one tape as it is the is the story is lovely it takes a few different and is n't quite as deep as the story it 's based on by but for a movie it stays very true to source material the only problem with this movie were the producer 's attempts to turn it into a movie hence the changed ending to allow for eye rolls apparently someday we 
 even if you could get past the idea that these boring characters personally every significant moment of the ok so did n't join the family and nobody died at this movie was still awful i got the impression that the writers just locked themselves in a room and watched the wonder years and oliver stone 's films over and over again and called it research a canadian television critic called the conclusion of the first episode head he was right 
 got back from then where my was attached to the german embassy when the film came out in europe took all my to see it show them the beauty of the country where had played and stayed where the stopped after leaving and before joining just at a friends restaurant in recently the el was much wilder in those days than it is now the stones went there earlier brian recorded in so it 's memories and family entertainment and 
 this is a bit long N hours N minutes but it had a a lot of the famous buck novel in it in other words a lot of ground to was at times but had some dramatic moments too capped off by a attack at the end of the film that was to view considering this film is about N years old the crew on this film did a spectacular and were actors in their day and they do n't 
 the plot of returns to earth as a monster died out in the mainly down to the scientific fact that outside the earth 's does n't humans cause to turn in to and that the first film to use this plot the experiment was the only decent movie to use the idea so the idea of having the plot return seems doomed from the start watching the incredible man it seems the plot is the least of its problems first 
 action movie with an interesting a young mafia killer chandler must demonstrate to his boss that he is a good man for the service so he goes to california to take some with a very known professional killer first and most important task to kill a young woman lee that is a completely strange for all of them but is she a easy target the movie goes on and on based upon this principal idea but the result is just

 if you have n't seen this it 's terrible it is pure trash i saw this about N years ago and i 'm still up from it 
 director lead actor in this film he attempts to gain acceptance for the otherwise very upbeat world of some of the acting is fair but some roles are the rather than mission president etc the film does give a fair look at how some may struggle with their faith but the actual program he claims to represent is far from his concept of it in terms of being upbeat and inspired the only i see in this film is 's 
 of all the major star hopkins has been the most and her string of excellent and films is quite impressive but she is often referred to as or yet she had a great sense of humor and was in several including this film old with davis and the smiling with maurice and hopkins was famous for her dislike of hollywood and the results has been a bad rep girl she play an trying to rescue the children of her dead

 as a fan of the old doctor who and after the fox movie i was dubious of this new series of doctor who i gave it a chance though and am so glad i some episodes are n't as brilliant as others but they are all and yes 's doctor is far from any we 've had before but 's doctor is just about the best there is his performance is at times at others dramatic sometimes completely crazy but

 the story is derived from king the setting is a farm in iowa here 's a test for this kind of thing if you find yourself asking why did do and the answer is because that 's what happened in ' you know that the film has failed well that is what happens here the father figure in this story is n't living his own life he 's a one but there 's more wrong with the film than is

 this is a pretty decent example of film the setting is the early N 's with the communists trying to steal weapon secrets from the us is the without he gives a pretty decent performance but there is nothing about him the interesting thing was that he was not only an but through most of the film an that is not very normal jean peters gave a performance as the hooker with the heart of gold that great character actress

 ok so it was written in N before so you can give it a little credit for worrying about and the idea that the cia director makes a plot to blow this doomed plane out of the sky before it brings to the world is that 's it that 's the good stuff the acting fair the plot silly the twist unnecessary it is n't as though no one ever thought of what to do when a plane gets do 
 i never figured out what the attraction of karen black was she always had those eyes and kind of an odd look about her she seemed to often be or cast as the other woman in this one she is the adviser and expert on the to a producer of bad commercials as he projection he is a mean even without the new apparently this is the avenue to because if you get good at it you can the bodies 
 cuba jr. is a secret service agent who blames himself over the assassination of the u.s. president i 'll point out straight away that this is not the type of role that this very actor is noted for and this film shows us why he teams up with a persistent news reporter to the conspiracy surrounding the president 's death and so on with a cast of james woods cuba jr anne and game ' fails to grab your attention 
 having read the other comments on this film i would like to share my own view that this is one tough movie to see unless you are a total i am looked at by a objective the film is an that presents us with more than are capable of being absorbed in one sitting it is quite difficult to watch the brooks character robert is so and that it is hard to to him alone root for him as he 
 to be clear from the get go ' is very very very bad it in almost every aspect except for one the finished product is such an awful film that it 's actually funny to watch this is a very film budget constraints for the film should be obvious to anyone who watches even just the opening title i 'm not sure if much of the in the film was intended or not for example the movie takes place in 
 i know franco is responsible for a wide variety of films and i mainly go for his films as as they are at times i guess it was that drew me to this and i was n't even enough to finish it maybe it got better the end but unless you 're into sex scenes of which there 's plenty then you may want to take a pass so what exactly can you say about a movie that features a 
 i 'm that the folks talking up this are of the director or something this is bad and not in the michael jackson song kind of way to compare the of this movie to the progress of a would be to the this movie along for what seems like an all to introduce us to some kids with silly makeup and some sort of or for blood or whatever believe me you wo n't care the thought alone that mom 
 contains some this movie is in all its the plot takes way too long to get off the ground never itself and then just plain crashes about N minutes into the film there are a few moments for fans but not nearly enough to create a real sense of also take a long time to make their appearance first there 's a whole half of a movie about and prison gangs the hero of the movie is an who gets 
 not knowing a great deal about the truth and reconciliation commission i can only look at this as a piece of entertainment i started watching it too late in the evening recorded from earlier this year but once i 'd started i had to watch to the is that it 's effectively a courtroom drama never my but it 's largely in and well acted like a good novel i could n't put it down all the way through i

 what is so about love people seem to have major problems with the title of this movie did n't catch my eye it was a shot about N minutes into the movie is what made me stop channel i could not believe how amazing this film was it on so many levels of human that it did not once fail to move me in some way it is by far one of the best independent films i have ever seen 
 before launching into whether this film is worth your time or not i should inform you i 've never seen another of so if you 're looking for a review on how it ranks others this might not be of much use to only time i 've come across was on the car stereo when driving through spain on a family holiday when i was a i did n't pay much attention to it because i did n't like opera 
 this film is a completely inaccurate of the real story of 's ark the producers probably did not even read the this is the worst movie i have ever seen 's wife was never mentioned by name in the but the writers of the film gave her the name this movie the destruction of a good N years before it happened and what about it too was destroyed at the same time was maybe the producers thought that not including 
 as a big fan of the original film it 's hard to watch this show the set and sets any style from this the mood is never there instead it has the look and feel of so many television movies of the is not a bad choice as walter but his and apartment do n't fit the mood of the original or make him an interesting does his best to make it work but is a really bad choice the

 it 's hard to know what was going through per and 's heads when they wrote from outer space the movie is billed as a comedy yet there are no real jokes the crude character names b. dick balls the rest of the movie is a presumably funny affair with with the ' basically reading their lines with no hint of feeling ' computer displays filled with mistakes and a plot that makes almost no though N of viewers have

 pa is one of the worst movies i 've ever seen but on the other hand is better then most of the movies from who are filled with characters and story without any bright ideas pa is bright optimistic and without any artistic moments in many interviews director tried to tell us that his movie is top quality just because it did n't cost a lot of money but thinking that way is wrong pa is for me very bad 
 i watched this with great and my was well founded it seems what was this movie about knight the season the players what it was all over the place all the time it had no tension sorry we all knew bobby was going to and throw things but brian a fine actor comes across as mailing in the anger and delivering zero tension shot like a episode contrast this main course with the job hbo did on the don king 
 this movie tries its to capture that classic bad canadian movie feel and characters a few town with folk a coffee shop or restaurant coffee shop here lots of shots of canadian stuff for ocean stuff here lots of mention of got get out of this town downright it succeeds on all to note though i could n't figure out whether this movie was just trying to be exposure comedy or something like a or the of this movie jumped 
 's is an old hollywood war but with sex and and supposedly no americans the story takes place on a island during the arrive to take over the island but with german supervision there is a romantic made up of a couple and the italian nice performances by all the actors cruz 's best work yet 
 i first saw this at a foreign film festival it 's a about a plot to relieve the treasury of a billion or so in gold it 's all shot in a style that hollywood rarely uses but it the atmosphere of the newly states note was actually looking a lot less grim in N when i was there 's a lot of humor and some too i do n't want to a number of startling yet logical surprises so 
 is what i call a pizza movie personal favorite that never fails to satisfy perfect for an evening at home with a pizza knowing all the lines and what lines by heart only the so many others here have the plot i 'll simply add the correction that 's character miss was a meaning she was a skilled therefore an educated person just a 's performance in this film the film was largely dismissed at the time but today 's 
 first of all i if i was supposed to use my in this film or the director was trying to save money or low on budget here we go basically there were so many years and that i do n't understand its like the movie was jumping from N years to N years to N and so much that makes you ask questions how the hell did this happen and why i think this is a big flow forget the 
 i do n't think the world was ready for this film i know i was n't i 'd been expected a standard instead i got the most of shakespeare since peter 's 's books this should become the definitive film version of and it wo n't of course but that 's the world 's loss 
 the film is severely awful and is to rape victims on the surface it may be a film about rape but if you dig beneath the surface what lies is a message about rape the rape victim is shown to be a victim who can not cope all because she is a woman she needs a man to help her when the society makes about her and throws comments at her she does not stand up for herself it is 
 is n't the main character of this movie he 's barely in it most of the screen time is dominated by jokes one running is that a character is named off there are also lots of jokes where the line is someone has an this movie is as funny as ally 's british is movie started off like a weak action movie five minutes of back story and then jokes but aside from the terrible writing the movie is also 
 i bought this on for my brother who is a big pfeiffer fan i decided to watch it myself earlier this is a reasonably entertaining piece containing two completely separate story lines the section with pfeiffer was by far the more interesting of the two she plays a rising hollywood actress who has had many short relationships she literally into brian a regular married guy with kids after driving her car into the back of his after being initially hostile 
 i have yet to read jackson 's novel something of which i 've been meaning to do for quite sometime i am sure it has got to be than this film i remember jumping once when i watched it the other day although i can not recall the scene the special effects are great and i watched this on but i am sure in the theatre it must have been an sight after the first few special effects are done 
 i can just about understand why some people might wish to stress this film 's link with the but i really would n't say it 's an accurate of most peoples ' lives in that era even on the poorest bradford it is however typical of the blunt the old royal court theatre was out at that time plenty of ' for small small audiences but enough to ensure future commissions for simple fact is that if you want to 
 i went to see this movie to kill some time i remember in and although his acting is wooden he does a tough leader character same here this movie was about a bunch of young hot scientists and exploring a in that one has to dive to see the beginning scene was very interesting with a bunch of or russian men exploring the in search of forward N years and we have a team of called in by some scientist 
 this is a movie about multiple as such it ought to move viewers and make them with the plight of the main characters however its style makes it almost the camera continually switches from one scene to another from one personal crisis to the next creating a effect most characters appear to live lives held together by their professional commitments it also credibility that a man who has just been given what amounts to a likely death sentence would in 
 in N released his film however due to the earlier import of george 's of the dead which had gone by that name for its italian release it was to which also had the bonus of letting the audience think this was a to the second movie continuing this theme the second film which would have been called N was then consequently titled in the the original film that is N was titled to continue this theme the second film 
 one would have expected 's return to major studio to on the side of caution surely few expected his most film a of vicious black comedy exciting manipulation and flights of fancy but that is precisely what they got on a is remarkable is how much bruno 's the world of the film much has been made of the but its immediate effect is to completely the straight line of progress guy is making of his life and hence the 
 this one is bad a really bad and boring crime movie that has nothing out of the ordinary in it a series of crimes the killer that you do not see throughout the whole movie the classic investigations and also the classic tale about a who figures out what 's going on and is n't believed by anyone so he has to fight by himself to reveal the truth not too much in this one vote N out of N

 this one acts as a during the women 's rights movement era of course that does n't mean coach the movie is a wonderful experience to it runs into the same as which was better but still and is basically standard fare what i mean for this movie being is simple to recognize anybody who serves time away from a normal job by training a bunch of earning their way to sudden victory makes waste it 's the same feeling 
 it was sad that committed lasted only two weeks in dallas theaters i thought this movie had a lot going for it the script was funny full of emotional shifts and it had a good message the acting was great everyone did a job especially with the script 's graham not only has beautiful eyes she has eyes for that matter all the actors were attractive why it did n't do well in its theatrical release i do n't know 
 people please do n't bother to watch this movie this movie is bad it 's totally waste of time i do n't see any point here it 's a stupid film with plot and the acting is poor i rather get myself beaten than watch this movie ever again 
 the first half hour of was rather boring and not but as the film so did my interest in the characters and the plot several scenes are really scary and you fear for the main characters who you actually grow attached to the story is about three hired hands on a hidden illegal farm in southern california they witness the murder of the farm 's owner malcolm john and they take over the for their own the three rather farm 
 was an outstanding series its what blue will never be on the are real the is real the relationships are real with back as a movie up all the loose ends it was good to have all the gang back together even a few that passed away show up say how the was fast emotional and full of the spirit the series had week in and week out life on the streets network drama at its best N stars up

 the regard of flight written and performed by bill is a true classic theatre piece which translated quite well to the small screen full of quick and and some of the best physical comedy of the decade it is head and above N of comedy as it is presented today i am sure it will one day take its place with such great shows as the and waiting for why it is n't available on yet is a mystery and

 the only explanation i can as to why this film is n't widely distributed is because it hits too close to home for some this movie was a genuine happy surprise the is this film turns the lights on in the dark that is organized and big media and the for cover rent the and watch it for yourself if you have n't yet this film succeeds where many have failed comes to mind to it 's nose under the 
 it is real easy to and otherwise this film for all of its abundant flaws it was made by high school students and faculty and a whole community it shows sure i could examine the script which is just ridiculous a monster created from the garbage of a growing city starts eating garbage and taking garbage cans all over the city soon this huge with wings no less begins to destroy buildings and even plays the beauty and the act 
 after having seen the lost child for quite a number of times since its release in N and having read the reader 's comments mostly about 's background and 's role in it it strikes me more than ever that no comments are made upon the brilliant role robert is playing as chris hughes even after N years it is still one of the most credible ways of portraying the complex of a child carrying the weight of his own 
 this is truly a of love about a character her outlook on life and her extended family the spent three years taping sister at her house and managed to capture so much wonderful material that you can not help but feel you know sister and her boys the house holds N recovering each with a story almost as involving as sister 's the ending scenes are particularly involving and 's story of marriage and loss reveals a very complex character 
 an intriguing of fantasy come to life in a child 's fever dreams however i imagine the average child is far more at scaring themselves than bernard rose is at the the between 's two realities on far too long to sustain interest especially considering that the little girl playing her is the most child actor i 've ever only for

 this was a movie prior to its release but turned out to be a i never talked to one person who ever liked this movie i agree i did n't like it either perhaps one big reason it was n't a box office success was that it had nothing but characters in the there i do n't know if this is still true i had n't any movie in which or played anything but and a stupid story make this 
 this movie is based on the true story of christopher and his friend lee this story takes place around the time of the dismissal in which during his time as a clerk for christopher was to classified which admitted the cia 's involvement in australian political and union circles the movie shows several scenes involving over us tv where events take place which confirm the classified documents that christopher had read previously the removal of was an organized cia coup 
 i saw this film in in july it deals with the of pilots who flew numerous for the after their country had been occupied by the in this film the action takes place both in the early N 's when these pilots are being beaten in political prisons in and during world war ii in britain they were after their return to their because the communist regime viewed these as a threat to their of the pilots maintain their dignity 
 this is a totally movie if you have n't seen it yet you damn well should sure the plot is slow to develop the special effects are the acting is ridiculous and the action is badly but as would say that 's not a bad thing that 's a good thing everything about this movie is especially if you get the dubbed version which has even worse actors it 's until you get to the end for the where the 
 when i heard about being released on and finally found it at my local store i thought well just another cheap monster movie from image those guys around and produced cheap but very entertaining b pictures in the past few months but also some very disappointing movies so i did n't expect much especially after having watched the rather disappointing zone just a few days before but turned out to be an excellent revival of the monster movies we have 
 first half of the movie scared the hell out of me and normally i 'm not easy to scare but second half of this did n't work quite a well but still very scary a good than use simple ways to make good set in russia unknown cast and made in europe but still great fun and yes there is a few throw in for good matters as well

 i really like he is a great actor i 've seen this movie because i 've heard that there are aspects in this film is full of like a piano sinking in a river or strange at the walls then the always says sentences like a kid sells fortune but her box is empty now this is really disturbing and was n't really necessary because everyone understands what this movie is all about the movie shows how 's character treated 
 if you wish to have a truly experience than this awful motion picture if you may consider to call it that is for you a film worse than the beach u.s.a batman and robin fair game well you get my film directed by french television patrick jerry with an of N can truly be considered the worst film ever made i do hope that or someone in america would distribute it so that the u.s.a can experience the french at 
 a brilliant and sensitive movie with plot lines as a general warning the movie turns quite dark about half way through as sudden as it is this is a change that i found to the themes of the movie particularly the comparison of the to the rich and as is said by at the end how each person makes up the tribe and how the whole tribe is reflected in each is spectacular in this movie he is probably best

 first i do n't see how the movie is on any best list or how it won any compared to la which is also on a best list la is gold this movie lacked so many things on so many different levels but i ca n't quite explain why i it so much the lead actor was i felt as though i never knew what was going on and i was even though this was supposed to be some life 
 i really liked this movie the characters are not the beautiful people that show up in so many movies and on tv it has a realistic edge with a story line the main title alone makes this movie fun to watch 
 what the hell was the point of this movie it looked pretty interesting in the beginning but quickly fell flat on its face its supposed to be based on a true story but for out loud is there no more script writers left in hollywood man ' e seen these guys in some of the best movies ever made can play just about anything and when i see he 's in a movie i do n't have a problem it

 i totally agree with the review by a of variety that the film is never quite as funny or about the creative process as its would seem to warrant it is and the lighting is really if the film is supposed to be the poor lighting does n't enhance the acting and it is sometimes difficult to the of the actors many will have difficulty in following the spoken english in the film and some of the local humor will

 this movie me it may be that i 'm just a stupid american but i really just do n't get N everything i 've read about this movie has been a total but i just could n't stay interested i 'm sure that it was as revolutionary in as all the critics say but when it right down to it it 's just really really boring maybe it 's the language barrier may i 'm just not sensitive or enough

 was awful this show was over but this is nothing but a bunch of the characters are and the story line is boring and endless think that it could have be something interesting if it have a better writing but it seems that the writers of the show have more intentions in show and his stupid friends fighting with some and then for his love with and and a lot of circles around the same thing again and again the 
 i love this film and it is such a wonderful example of a family jeopardy a romantic love story and a very sad story plot everything was just so perfect and excellent about this film it was such a great of actors and and with some and a lot of this film deserves to get plenty of with the mention of beautiful scenario and although i would this film to the notebook and the family stone it was sort of 
 as a big fan of larry western and the series in particular i was looking forward to moon what a tremendous maybe my expectations were set too high because of the all around of the story the characters the the music it all moon by comparison comes across like a bad saturday night live the characters are completely the dialogue is and the plot all over the place it seems like the actors are all reading from i could n't

 how could i possibly pass up the chance to see and together well i could n't and so i this mess of a had never heard of kelly and was surprised by what i found out about this young man 's i was also surprised at how this movie was perhaps the fact that it was very very late and at the end of a N hour movie marathon or maybe it was because it really is a little slow 
 this film has recently been televised by turner classic movies it may have been considered in its time and may have made money but even the most russell fan will find it hard to sit through this are many movie from the which can withstand the test of time even though dated by current standards but which can still be enjoyed because of good music or or an amusing plot the french line however fails at all of these does 
 what kind i say about this movie well for i thought that this film was not the greatest not worst i said this cause i thought that the script was great and original really different and now i would n't say that it 's the greatest film that i 've seeing cause of the acting the actors that played each role seems that they played them without as if they took the life out of them when the wife or

 absolutely whatever i say would n't do this movie the justice it deserves watch it now 
 when a movie like the of brings in over $ N million it makes some sad statements about the condition of our own society either we are too stupid to stay away from trash like this or maybe i 'm just not how many people this kind of trash will appeal has had no incentive to make good movies since if it puts out trash then people will see it since there is nothing else on screen this is that

 of is possibly the most exciting movie seen in recent years it all expectations and is truly a work of art with and story of of proceeds to blow over its viewers with its this movie is through the use of high which allows fans of the fantasy to see their come to life the acting is perfect for this type of movie if you were an with powers i would think you 'd keep more to the comments of 
 rather then long dance and close ups of the characters which made the film drag on the movie would have been better served explaining the story and of the of the minister mother and the down of the dynamic and important between and and and made the movie lack any real if you had n't read the book you would not really understand why loved the chairman and why became her at the film was stunning and the actors all 
 i just went to a of the film during en a short film festival in mexico one of the producers was there and gave a brief introduction the film rolled and from the first shot i was one long shot of a paris in black and should n't go on with the details i think it is a film worth seeing the story might be found average for many to me was really good the action is great the camera 
 out of the first five episodes of 's house of series this fifth episode with the wonderful title the house that to death is the one as a great fan of the studios ' films for many years i wonder what took me so long to finally start watching the series quite recently so far i 've only seen the first five episodes and i have a strong feeling that the best is yet to come but even if the 
 the movie directed by james the and friends the and stories of how they all came star in their first feature film bringing the magic they are known for to a bigger picture the story is not too complex and is written as a of sorts the well written jokes appear as each character gets a worthy introduction the are n't just thrown in either but written in as interesting characters making one of the many for our friends 
 contains i saw an for this on a my sister discovered that we had the book so i read the video on the same day i finished the thought it was very as was the book the cast was was excellent as and rupert was as music and are don read any more if you haven watched the downside there are some sex scenes that have been added in and some is why the video is rated there are some 
 i completely disagree with the other comments i too saw this film at an early and found it quite robin williams is in top form true the tone is familiar but it is williams of good morning vietnam smart funny on point after too many dark turns williams is finally back to what he does best the supporting actors give great performances especially and chris chris plays himself as usual but as the agent to the next president he was 
 excellent nice camera i do n't remember seeing a movie of late with good until this one could have avoided scenes with a soft camera is liked the upside down in particular a different touch not impressive do n't stick around in your mind even after watching the movie may be i expected same quality like a disappointment actors needs to slowly pull away from action his age and really show up also he should avoid close romantic going forward 
 just thinking about the movie i to myself anne plays an part as ' probably the most nasty yet ever captured on film danny and crystal make a duo bringing a true to the film though not complex the story holds your attention and keeps you laughing the whole way through it 's a fun comedy to things up and even will the kids i give it my full recommendation 
 i agree with with of the messages on here that the book is not like the movie i read the book as a in high school in i instantly fell in love with the book and the release of the series as much as i liked the movie and thought it was very well done i was disappointed that the movie did not follow the book i was glad the was not killed off like he was in love and 
 at first this looked like a boring comedy like the odd couple but when i got into it it turned out to be a really funny film basically clark golden globe winner and and walter and al lewis winning and golden george burns were a great comedy duo and a brought back together to revive their hospital for a tv show 's ben clark golden globe winning richard benjamin is confident they can get together again with no hard feelings 
 when i saw it for the first time i was really director made such a atmosphere especially in the end through all the story can expect that richard will really kill thomas or he will do it the main point was not conflict but friendship older and mature one himself to save the younger who has the whole life to is amazing every time i watch it i enjoy of course it is pretty violent like every action movie but 
 i really liked this picture because it dealt with two people in love and one of them having a though the ending me i know that that was the best way for it to finish off i would this to everyone 
 as this happens to be one of most favorite novels i was very excited to see the move i was not disappointed yes of course there are a few things that i could pick on but i think that the movie stuck true to the book and was a really good movie it seems that stephen king films mostly get a bad review but this is one of the good ones it is such a dark story which i guess 
 the cure is an amazing film so and just so real i was lucky enough to catch a of cure ' at it 's premiere and it completely me away i also heard it won an award from that particular festival and it definitely it the first thing that struck out at me was the eric did an amazing job the shooting style of the love scene into the film was amazing a love scene was necessary in this film 
 this movie seems to start in the middle peripheral players as if they were significant and presents main characters without any substance and almost nobody has a credible or for their actions in this film the plot and ultimately goes nowhere the dialogue is and and the director has little concept of how to get the best from his actors it almost feels like there 's a first half of this movie but it never got 're told that a 
 one of the best comeback movies i liked this was the phase when was going strong with the were and totally as we call it type an with the likes of the in the story line has a lot of and turns as is known for david 's with a timely appearance by it was a total the end it was great to see perform with such force and humor after a long although some may consider it a typical 
 an excellent and accurate film mcgovern takes great to research and document his writing and it pays off he is not afraid to tell the truth even though it might draw reviews and comments from some who like stories to be clean and sweet and again mcgovern brings in christopher though not in as high a profile a role as he played in i found this movie as accurate well acted and well presented as and i mcgovern for his 
 i was surprised that the makers of this movie actually came out said that this movie was a true story the majority of the scenes looked fake to me for instance when the one girl was eating her and there was a in it while she was eating the the camera on the opposite side of it showed that there was a on it it 's funny how the camera just happened to be on the when the girl was 
 totally jokes that fall flat acting with one or two exceptions boring characters and dialogue that 's at best after watching this movie one must wonder how on earth a producer could come across a project like this and think i must make this film no wonder it could n't get a theatrical release 
 apparently most knows nothing about the history of europe including germany hungary and the whole central and eastern europe as well as the and era and a lot of forgotten trials all over europe was a and of the winners what do you think why were not any american british french or soviet defendants after the there were no american british etc war crimes there were no hiroshima no no tokyo no no no berlin no and so on the 
 when i heard the film was to be released and the theme of what it was about i felt very but when i saw it was the biggest of my life technically speaking the sound is poor you can tell about man that were on studio that are poorly achieved in the final mix of all the photography is some part of the films show some soldiers with night vision and the way the that dark night is by everything 
 this is one of the best tv movies i have ever seen the title makes it so obvious and predictable but come on all tv movies are like that the story is it may seem ridiculous but it is based on an true story gary plays a military man named dave who feels trapped in his marriage he his wife and kids and then his death all so he could be with karen how far will dave go to keep

 having grown up in texas and less than N miles from what used to be 's i can tell you that this movie is the majority of texans do not live like this movie indicates the plot is weak and the fake are amusing and it the image that all texans are beer drinking ' the fake texas is what it for me true there is a certain texas to most texans ' but these people it you ca n't 
 it 's amazing that this no talent actor got all these well known stars to appear in this dismal and film about a low life who looks white but is half mexican much of the acting is bad and many of the well known stars in this movie are given a script that seems made up by a N year old i 'm sure this movie is the career low point for actors such as and who i 'm sure 
 by rights there should never have been a first blood part ii the original script for first blood had john committing at the end of the film but this was changed to allow him to live not because the producers wanted to make a but because test audiences found the original ending too nevertheless someone obviously thought that the character was too good to waste because he ended up as the hero of two more films in the plus the

 this is without a doubt the greatest film ever made it is nearly even with many repeated in an attempt to figure out what exactly 's going on the film was almost entirely and includes random musical numbers commercials one enters by mail and a host of other besides what other movies have by martin king jr to the film hunt down the director 's book entitled i was it 'll all become clear it 's a grand and bold 
 i experienced for the first time on television a year ago and i was surprised with the is said to have with but this is a film that effectively stalled his career somewhat what an unfortunate thing to happen because like the of this film seems to be has created a of in this story it begins as a traditional film but soon becomes a regarding to man for the is tough at the best of times but when the 
 short version seed is n't it 's just derivative and and version if you have never seen any of the films the psychological this movie will probably your face off maybe not but it will give you a good the opening of real animal abuse will be sufficient to open your eyes to possibilities of and the only scene later in the film will perhaps be more than you can handle the will play with your in a way that

 i just finished watching el i have always taken my hat off to 's performances as he is a great actor but this movie is really and slow i guess that it would have been even worse if it was n't for this is definitely a film that you will never understand if you are not from argentina and even if you are i would advise you not to rent this movie in order to have a nice time with 
 i the video of the piano teacher knowing nothing about it other than what was written on the video box i did this with some because films that win at are usually very good or very bad unfortunately this one falls in the latter category about one quarter of the way into it i found myself saying out loud this movie is boring about half way through i was saying to myself where have i seen this before at the 
 man i loved this movie this really takes me back to when i was a kid these were the days when the teachers still showed classroom films on and if you were good they would the movie slowly so you could watch it play i still remember one of the opening lines was his name and he was an he lived with his sister so and so in the village this is a great movie for kids and as as 
 while it certainly was n't the best movie i 've ever seen it was certainly worth the $ N which ca n't be said for many movies these days this was a account of a true story although many of the details of the real story were for the movie sunday 's character was three or four people in the real story combined together robert was of course good and cuba jr. was also impressive

 this on william castle takes a few cheap shots at the environment in which he did his most characteristic work look at the funny silly people with the but it 's also and with particularly bright commentary from john waters who was absolutely the target audience for such things at the time and from castle 's daughter who her and also is pretty about how he his craft we never find out what became of the other castle the movies

 this movie was strange mainly because the plot was so the title to a vicious wind which the surface of the earth almost when it but this seemed to have nothing to do with what was going on the movie seems to be an extremely poor of being by hunter or in this turns in a surprisingly good performance as nothing seems to be resolved at the end of the movie we never find out anything of any substance about

 i have loved this movie ever since it 's debut in N i have lost track of how many times i have seen it it never fails to make me or me up if i am feeling down the three leads are and the script is plus how do you not get hearing the theme song i think i quote this movie without it i basically know the entire script so when someone is watching it for the first time 
 apparently the film has a harsh message if it does i did n't get it that 's all it is it 's boring and 's too serious at times to be a comedy too slow to be a not funny not not exciting not film it 's too everything to be the opposite and i was at how bad a film could do n't even think of watching have watched literally hundreds of films and never have i been so 
 of a beauty is a bit better than its predecessor of a virgin although this film is n't really a in the sense that it has absolutely nothing to do with the first installment i did find beauty to be a little stronger and better put together than virgin but then again that 's not really saying starts off as a pretty rough and exploit film a couple of are holding a young woman prisoner and begin gang her in

 this film you from the opening scenes and never lets go you watch upon 's excitement over coming to america he 's a fellow you can not help being of him even when his eagerness is replaced by as his fortunes turn you know that in his circumstances you would be forced to make the same choices he does to survive this movie comments on society 's of beauty and all things and is only more true in the culture

 i have to say that a cat in the brain is one of the most fun and films i 've ever seen this film is packed with stupid ridiculous scenes and a plot legendary director is about an aging director who is also named in the film who is starting to go and because of all the vicious things he 's put down in film over the past many years he goes to a shrink who and tells him that 
 this comment does contain there are few actors that have an to them that quality which is an of and it 's the quality that can separate good actors from the truly great i think george has it and so does jack you can look at 's in scenes like his one word to andy garcia in ocean 's N when they just each other 's name terry danny you can pick any number of jack 's performances dating as

 the good at webster 's define as the of words ' i may just be for no word combination me more than when at the beginning of a film credits contain the words produced written and directed by ' and are followed by a single individual 's name think about it there are and but so few even the most of directors like and rarely take such control of their films but there i was all in my theatre seat 
 this is at it 's and it 's had my doubts because even though freeman is great actor sometimes he gets involved in bad projects this is not one of those 's a small story that runs just over an hour and in a time when we are getting used to having movies become longer and longer and not necessarily better the director uses the short time to his advantage because the characters are so well defined from the start 
 well the reason for seeing it in the was that it was a else i would never have seen this terrible movie i mean have n't we had enough of this yet and scary movie at least did not take them serious the plot and the acting is the worst i 've seen only can compare which is also the only movie that competes in being the worst i 've seen in the with this one there is so many

 an unknown cast which seem likely to remain that way this film is yet another cheap which me how this was released i have no problem with and in particular in fact they are my but when they are done this bad it really does take the and its no wonder the has such a hard time the story is as and without as possible with a bunch of people in a out in the woods being slashed and up 
 my personal vision of hell is being locked in a room without the ability to close my eyes or block my and have this movie play for on every available surface in that room the whole notion that plays a only begins to the surface of how ridiculous a this movie is the single most important thing about watching any movie is the concept of willing suspension of it is impossible to do that in this movie 
 now that 's it 's N who really has a care in the world about a guy like even back then he was n't a big tickets to is an outlined story that 's well and true where three friends hit the road under each of their personal circumstances again a proved plot the problem with this film other than it 's bad it 's compelling ' title is the after three guys do the same things you 've seen 
 this is one of the few film surprises i 've had in quite some time everybody and i do mean everybody i talked to when it was in the said it was awful but then i got to thinking none of these people really understand films or metal rock so why do i listen to them in the first place this film but only if you are able to and enjoy this type of entertainment in short too late see

 i just saw this last night it was broadcast on the canadian broadcasting corporation 's eye ' series it has been recently sept.

 N turns out to be something of a big disappointment and even though sam had a hand in the along with robert it still emerges as a written movie directed by the top billed as is wrong for the part he 's not enough to play the great mexican revolutionary his one note performance lacks the fire and anthony or could have brought to the role simply looks like a russian dressed up like a mexican who is in the

 i 've read a number of reviews on this film and i have to say what is wrong with you people this was an excellent film i thought this film was from start to finish and the story was extremely well told i 'm convinced that the people that did n't like this film were n't paying very good attention to the film there are a number of very important scenes that if you are n't paying attention you will 
 before sky i saw lane 's tender performance in this otherwise of a movie are invited to the camp of their youth and experience it as adults each of those that return seem to be looking for something they lost which makes it so realistic maybe you had to be a to really get it but in the words of one character all her clothes were this is so camp from the practical jokes and fighting over to the scary 
 i think this is almost all i need to say i feel obliged to explain my actions though i 've basically never seen such an production and i mean that in all of the word although the physical camera work boom operation and other technical aspects of this film are unfortunately its not the only some classic independent films that have been saved by their scripts great and plot this unfortunately has an awful script awful acting and worst of 
 i must say this is easily one of my favorite movies to watch on halloween the halloween party the acting the guy dressed like and extra from miami vice great great great i have a huge place in my heart for random N 's and this one reached out and at my heart i always passes this at blockbuster and always at the cover of the box now every weekend i would grab a random movie i had never seen 
 though i have watched i do not know if if it does this film is accurately titled so much of so little substance this is the equivalent of only it does not the it leaves the taste of wasted time in the mind 's mouth and if i could this film and get back that i would was more exciting the director should be forced to wear a cap and the spirit of ed wood jr. could n't save this 
 having watched the show for about four weeks which is enough to get a feel for the show i think it shows potential much is borrowed from other shows what does n't these days and the characters are i like what they are doing with the stories there is some with plot development and character building despite the essentially nature of each episode there have been some science related topics as well as character these have also added some comedy 
 this film is all about humans this film stayed as my all time favorite short for n't it the things that make life so much more interesting we humans are so soft funny to each other one moment we the most beautiful and amazing machines to kill as many people as possible with the least effort the next in our short lives we destroy our world each other and often our own lives than spend the rest of our lives

 in reflecting on this movie i can think of two others to help put it in perspective one relatively but covering the same geography is coup de the other thousands of miles away and much larger in scope is the has produced a movie that has some of the grand of the complex and relationship between france and her colonial was struck with the dignity of with his struggle to maintain his dignity among his and with his white bosses 
 i love the way he experiments ab was a to watch just as much and company was the new also lived up to his role and was at his best was really but i think he fit the character he was playing he had really teeth the story has a great progress and no in the movie makes it better i only wish he signs up for his other up coming movies i think they are the best director and

 edward 's is supposed to play like a crime with a little film mixed in for flavor instead it 's a poorly acted look into low budget and film making the plot is absurd and the acting stiff and john miles who had a rather thin resume in the industry and throughout and everyone else acts with the same as characters in a about driver safety the movie anticipates shows like it to ' and knows best ' in its

 this is one of the best movies on the french revolution ever produced being a person well in the the period i was at the level of detail the are spot on even the detailed little day to day items such as ink wells serving etc are all perfect as an american living in france who has access to the sites in the movie through his membership in various historical associations such as the alliance i can not over state 
 i went to see this movie twice within a week and can only sum it up in one word which i normally do n't use wonderful in my view the best movie ever made who deserves and other if not this swedish crew who have created in the last scenes of the film when everything that is said and left throughout the story is drawn together just as the character of daniel so many and long feelings within the people

 i watched this movie only it was expected to be yet another by david bad bad comeback by david has made lots of funny movies in past which made no sense but none of them was a bag what a waste of talent and beauty it was why actors agree on movie like was not a of in this movie is below par and not at all justifies the standard and potential only thing worth watching in this movie was

 you have to see it to believe it directors and mark have done a thing really great it is a N out of N so i can not believe that other user of this had rate it so poor unless they were expecting to see just a normal movie with people love scenes and so on i am also convinced that this kind of are an excellent way to wake up us in order to save our beautiful planet finally 
 red rock west was far and away one of the best of the N 's with a script by john and rick that kept you throughout and on the edge of your seat for most of the film it was directed by john and featured a cast including dennis and especially j. t. in a performance making this a and not to be missed the film never had much publicity on release in fact i first caught up with it

 i avoided this film as a boy because i thought it would be boring no fights or shooting cowboys or indians it was definitely not a cool film to like so i did n't see until i was in my and found it one of the most beautiful films i have seen all the actors deliver the perfectly and each is drawn from the scene by scene the and direction are simple but feel so natural and drew me completely 
 i am at the us networks what is the matter with them yet another very very promising series after just N episodes and we are left not knowing what the hell happens to everyone i really enjoyed this show and am so that we will never find out what happens to the characters and the ' from the deep this show had everything action what more could you want why oh why did the pull the plug on this it

 as someone who likes chase scenes and was really by this tale i was optimistic heading into this film but too many obstacles got into the way of the good story it should have bad i 'm a fan of robert and many of the characters he has played but his role here is a one as an insurance is and the pretty is real from what i read there were several directors replacing each other on this film and

 me and a friend this movie because it sounded really good but we were wrong first of the acting the acting was the worst the effects were really bad as well it seemed like a film a college kid made the plot was pretty good but it 'd been done the thing that the movies the most were the actors the main guy was the worst actor ever it 's a shame i 'm even calling him an actor the 
 this was one of the most boring movies i 've ever seen i do n't really know why just your stories about guy who is about to get married and starts to fancy someone else instead story has been told a thousand times nothing new or innovative about it at do n't really know what was wrong with this film most of the time when these kinds of get together to make a film that have already been made a

 how could this get a rating are we as fans so used to films being so utterly bad these days that when one comes along that has some and i repeat some ' quality 's we get much too excited and give a rating that is just a bit too high the director has a certain no doubt about that but in between some decent shots he a good story mood or it had a very slow first act killing 
 when i saw the first movie it was a see the acting and effects this film seemed to make up for the acting but not the special effects after and sure why not make a film about a killer the the new york waters where N police investigators try the before the of pretty clean plot and but the was pretty much its nice to see they actually made it this time but it looked like a piece of plastic

 i went to see this thinking it would be a great comedy and a comeback for robin williams but when i saw it i realized i had to by advertisers as this is more drama than comedy although it has a few really good in it it felt like i was watching two movies one was a funny with robin williams that should have been the whole basin for the movie anyway but you also get a movie with political 
 my expectations were quite high for this film everyone i know who saw this film at the told me that everyone there stayed through the credits because they were so touched my expectations could not have been any higher anything short of wonderful would have disappointed was anything but disappointed by this movie i loved how it dealt with difficult subjects without going through the usual steps a hollywood film tends to include in this film characters worked through problems 
 this movie was in the former soviet union because it was the first movie released there that contained a real sex scene however the movie can be considered great for many reasons not the least of which is its true portrayal of and pain in the family of a working class soviet family i would definitely recommend it 
 i did n't like this movie for many reasons very boring it was interesting how they thought what the future would look like in this but seriously i was very watching this there was hardly any action although the classical was very nice the were very creative whenever this movie on tv i feel like changing the station instantly not because it is a bad movie just because i know what i am in for when watching this complete and 
 surprisingly good the acting was fun the was fun the music was fun the plot was fun this was a fun movie to watch and to give your brain some rest parts of the plot and quotes i found to be very creative N out of actually for what it was it would deserve a N out of you are not supposed to compare this to an film or to a bloody film

 a to who 's afraid of virginia this film on and on occasionally your interest only to put you through more and obvious but plot may list as N minutes but feels like three hours of painfully wasted time 
 this film had about everything one could wish when it originally at the end of the N 's decade it was entertaining and provided a contemporary view of the many changes which had occurred during that period and were still ongoing in terms of the black power movement vietnam and the volatile movement which followed the preceding postwar of this and one of the films then or it for the second time recently i was surprised to find it as 
 shows a lack of talent here with this supposed comedy the script is completely let alone the fact that it is and badly worked the comedy just does not work when is n't using poor taste sex jokes he is borrowing used and them very poorly you would think the of and brother charlie would be cool but it entire cast is and never managing to raise a and barely a from their audience do yourself a and leave this 
 really an amazing pile of a predictable slow moving soul destroying mind movie to which your own with a bread seems well almost acting is over done for the thin dialogue every scene is at least twice as long as it needs to be the details of how this career is or that career is rising is just far too and mundane for words the music would be good if you did n't have to sit through the movie but 
 this may or may not be the worst movie that steve martin has ever made but it certainly was far from his best obviously he did this for the pay check like this certainly does nothing to enhance his reputation as a funny man what he does n't seem to grasp is that when people go to see a steve martin movie they expect to be not to it 's sad that he dragged dan and phil down with him 
 i enjoyed this movie but it is nothing here is it with other war movies this movie has been its not a war movie any more than one flew over the is a movie or cool hand is a prison movie this is a movie about and the costs of that plot is the same as one flew over the and cool hand its in good company and it holds its own its these movies it should be held up 
 i have seen it a few times and get completely to it every time it is very and intense to describe it sounds boring but it is amazing it is the kind of movie where you need ca n't miss a thing but if you it in it with you long after it ends now thinking about it i do n't even know what stone was trying to make us see just the story of alan green i do n't

 i thought this movie was going to be even though i 've liked alvin and the for a long time i was was very wrong it was great it has been the best movie i have seen since october in my opinion it 's the movie everyone should see this holiday season i thought anyway was awful the golden was but the ending was pretty to his dark materials fans and i am well i have n't seen that yet

 the girl in ' lane N out of N in the movies is a well known phenomenon plenty of have come out of film schools about the hidden in such films as top gun and the girl in s lane certainly fits the in fact it is so and over the top even whom rarely notes such things in their simply can not avoid film is about two one a rich kid brown running away from home with a hundred

 it seems a lot of europeans and americans see indian movies for the wrong reason i see some people are complaining that this movie did not have any dance a class apart from their counterparts movies tend to be more realistic is one of the best young directors in india being widely known for his choice of subjects for the movies and the strength of his scripts ' is a perfect example a of the nobel 's novel dealing with 
 i had never heard of this film before a couple of weeks ago but its concept interested me when i heard it an american man meets a european woman on his last night in europe and they spend the night together talking it sparked my interest but i never expected it to be this great before is a and it 's also one of the most romantic films on record to my surprise it completely lacked the of the it 
 i had to watch this movie with my he did n't once during the entire movie and he dogs and will at nearly anything this movie was horrible from all aspects poor script even accounting for a children 's movie poor production the jittery camera shots made me feel for the first ten minutes poor acting perhaps they were directed to act and even poor sound quality there are parts where the audio level seems fine then you ca n't 
 this is a account of the hunt for the soviet union 's first known serial killer i had in just expecting a tv movie but found myself drawn by the compelling way the story was told as others have said there is much to here that is lacking in many big screen of the credit must go to chris whose and direction draw the in until it is impossible not to feel involved the acting by the whole cast is 
 men of honor has many great aspects to it good action plenty of feel good scenes a good musical score but the part that really makes the movie is the great acting mostly by robert the story of men of honor is focused about carl played by cuba jr. who wants to be the first african american deep sea in the navy it his rough struggle from being a poor farmer to getting into school and even further it is 
 N is the best television show it 's an incredible tv series with an incredible excellent and characters and the first episode of all is my best evidence because it 's only the first episode only the introduction and you are because of the plot and the and is a federal agent who is assigned the protection of the senator david palmer he ca n't trust in anybody because people of the may be involved and when this events occurred

 i am an indian in the united states why india continues like a animal to everything american is beyond me the main problems with the movie are n't so much the plot and comedy it is that this movie has a lot of sex women like in the streets and a lot of that does n't belong anywhere on the producers and directors of this movie i have this message you continue to weaken our nation 's strong family values 
 how rick was allowed to make five movies is harder to believe than cold fusion this film is absolutely criminal before watching this movie i thought hands of fate was the worse piece of i ever saw but at least moves so slowly you might fall thereby your eyes from the pain it will suffer the greatest tragedy of this movie is that the old man that keeps the locked up makes it to the final scene the time i 
 just ca n't watch this bit too many times it 's full of true enthusiasm and mouse had in his first N years ' is an smart little when compared this always makes me at least the ending where after hitting a with a potato is very nice and although has no the music is enough for if this bit does n't deserve then any does n't not only because it 's a true classic but also because it 's

 i 'll make this short and sweet this movie i watched part N earlier today and thought it was one of the greatest films ever gave it N out of N stars so i thought perhaps part N and N would be good i was wrong this movie me to death and was so different from the first one it had the plot continue and it it was like bad from part one or love but i felt sorry for 
 some have praised as a disney for adults i do n't think so at least not for thinking script suggests a beginning as a movie that struck someone as the type of you can not sell to adults anymore the crack staff of many older movies has been done well before think but represents one of the worse films in that the characters are weak even the background that each member out seems stock and at best an man a 
 i have personally seen many disney movies in my lifetime though absolutely none of them match up in any way to and although i personally would n't have crossed with it was an improvement on trying to dress people up as characters the movie pits three from world war two who are sent to stay with a silent and woman in the country i would have to say that the casting was brilliant made a perfect miss price while david 
 it 's painfully obvious that the people who made this movie have never seen such brilliant as the naked gun and hot shots this movie is terrible and so are the actors they would n't know acting even if it hit them in the face as i felt like doing while watching this total pile of movie is stupid and has no humor in it what so ever i 'm sure that i could make a better movie with my 
 although this series and the film in particular were very important at the time of release i feel that the series as a whole was actually fairly poorly written with a weak cast the issues at heart are extremely well portrayed yet it is difficult to and understand the problems within the film when the acting and script is n't convincing enough especially when looking at the film also do n't believe that this film or series has stood the 
 it starts a little slow but give it a chance in the spirit of the ship in the arm and the this movie is about a not so orthodox group engaged in not so orthodox methods to everyone is as a that takes himself way too seriously which results in a failed attempt and crew makes him walk the in contrast similar to grant does not take anything to serious except the job this movie is more about lines than

 director 's routine the yellow N pits the against the u.s. with tough in the middle as the indian who has to lead the to safety this united artists western was in color but the tv print that turner classic movies aired was in black & action opens with reed of black several indians and riding up to with his old friend and chief fire lee van of the good the bad and the who has killing on his mind 
 before is for the generation richard 's romantic drama is an telling of a dream come true for most people the film in all it 's glory but without any of the that most couples and in short the film is about two people that have a relationship that 's as close to as relationships will ever come to with just one problem the problem of time while most relationships wind down with time this one keeps going strong throughout 
 the straight story is the tale of an old man who decides to visit his sick brother who lives across the state line he decides to make the trip on his as he ca n't drive and he wants to make the by himself the film his and the lives he along the way richard turns in a beautiful performance as do the rest of the cast most notably in an performance as his daughter and harry dean in a 
 if you like animal movies this movie will please my wife likes animals and animal movies she especially like the in this film it is geared kids but i at most of the humor the french fashion character made me and adds balance to the script it is a disney film with its family but i like leaving the theater with a positive 
 the scenes are the characters are great i love johnson 's acting i really like the ending however i was disappointed that this movie did n't deeper into 's and 's relationship it only when they each other 
 you know you are in trouble watching a comedy when the only amusing parts in it are from the animal cast it is a then that the cat & dog were only in support & not the other way around as the humans in it were pretty i were you paul lake what sort of name is that & i would forget this acting & do something else as all of you are as funny as watching dry & awful 
 the topics presented are very interesting suburban culture suburban public transportation oil & gas depletion energy alternative energy sources problem is that this is a pure and propaganda piece one viewpoint is presented then upon the over and over you see the same handful of ' repeatedly making their case the supposed ' starts off like a news reporter but by the end even he is the film 's dark side of the film is not so much the and 
 i loved this episode it is so great that all N of them team up and stop and save the world i also love this episode because bart and justin oliver arrow are guest in it i just hope that clark will join the justice league and we 'll get to follow this group of heroes across the globe it was really exciting and keeps viewers interested because of what will happen next i think should also join the team 
 if you tried to make a bad film you could not make one worst that this one i ca n't imagine anyone paying good money to see trash like this in a theater the thing that really gets you is being in looking at the entire thing just for the of seeing how it could get the of this film was seeing the words the end 
 i saw this video N years ago and would love to see it on a good film but i would have loved it even more if it had included the of the and the also do n't know exactly how true the story is were some changes made to the story i was only N when buddy and did n't wake up to his music until the late N 's much later i found out our family moved into our 
 many people remember the that occurred a long time ago what most people probably have in their minds is the leader david and the images of the compound burning to the ground after a long a lot of people have the belief that was some kind of who thought he was god he was accused of being a child and was credited for the breakdown and deaths of his furthermore many people feel the committed mass when the fbi mount 
 so they the violence and it 's been as sick well the violence is the best bit i 'm afraid but unfortunately the characters are not developed enough to allow us to understand why they go on their entirely predictable this film has a truly script we never get a chance to get to know robert and his actions at the end are just plain the acting is n't much better either the worst of them being the tv and 
 i fail to understand why people love this show so much a friend of mine watches this and since i like i tried to watch along since the plot of the show sounded promising but in truth it really is a very boring show the only thing that will keep you during this show are the video and the complete of note that i call it because they actually really look like not like the aliens they should of which 
 no bad music and i am a metal guy so i would be vulnerable to some good stuff everything is half done the brother is a there is nothing to hold us in except to see what from the they 'll pull up next the tour manager tries to bring a to the thing but is n't given enough time is and is we know she did n't need the money is this the only role she could fit into 
 these are the kinds of movies i loved and still love growing up unlike big budget movies that huge plot and never acknowledge them this movie takes in all in and just makes something you can sit back and was some film student earlier that complained it was n't a list material but that is not the point the point of this movie is that no everyone likes huge ' filled movies there are a lot of people who like 
 everything i remember about it was excellent great cast with sam & george before he became more familiar to us audiences excellent scripts as only the english can do peter type but with a twist sort of like would have been had it been in england N years earlier right at the beginning of the revolution of the 've often if the of saw these shows first aired about N years still have N episode on a much deteriorated tape 
 boy next door is a through male in just over minutes the film takes us on a that most features ca n't even match great performances excellent camera work and short is a classic from start to finish to davis for pulling double duty as both director and star he 's the since allen and what a treat to see richard back again if you thought all he could do was play bull the on night court think again this 
 where to start i feel violated right violated i just spent of my life that i could have spent doing something more useful like watching dry on this so called not scary its not funny its not dramatic its no action its nothing its predictable its boring its i might come of a bit harsh here but watch this movie and you will feel the same way or no do n't watch it unless you want to feel violated also 
 this film has to rank down there with ed wood films a terrible script and bad bad machine gun fight in front of plate glass windows minutes go by before anyone is hit and nobody has cover not one window ever breaks you 'd think after a fire fight like that the big truck might be not a cia agents and government contractors top secret information at a party with hundreds of people is n't one actor you care about

 i do n't think this is too bad of a show under the right conditions i the first this is a show about lawyers who are n't really lawyers god anybody actually go to law school based on these shows which i had heard was the case when i watched some interviews of the show it just made me a aside and who are supposed to be the stars of the show are the most while this might be a

 no despite violent films that reflect quality are scarce indeed largely because of themes from the to the screen too often falls short of effective execution as a result of insufficient funding or inadequate and unfortunately for its producers this work is lacking on both counts so in the case of the latter with essentially no budget with which to operate it is a grave mistake to attempt the of such a of events as those within this scenario and 
 a very bad film an of and historical a few examples in an early scene soviet are attacked by the germans instead of staying in their to shoot at them they advance into open ground to fight them contrary to all tactics kate one of the central characters is supposedly the daughter of a white russian and with her yet she does not speak russian a german attacks an the gun however does not fire but scores a direct hit

 i ca n't even believe that this show lasted as long as it did i guess it 's all part of the down of america personally like david said i liked this show better when it went by its original title what me the most about this show aside from the obvious base sense of humor and general is the way the episodes are titled truly great shows are still funny after many repeated like the one where gets on

 first of all let me start by saying that i have been a devoted of c thomas 's career ever since the outsiders and the he was an up and coming star in the with hits such as soul man also the future was bright for this young actor and he had the potential to go on from there and really himself in hollywood put it this way tom cruise had a bit part in the outsiders while had the 
 of course i have disappeared into the movies the neil young concert film of gold ' there have been many great concert films through the years the best being martin 's last ' which the band 's last concert at west a concert and a film that is if you love rock and roll and felt as if you had been born into it and were part of the music and could be in the band if you had a 
 boring rank plot some of the worst direction i 've ever come across acting and the movie ends with one of the main characters from a dream what 's with that even jr from dallas could n't survive that twist you have what can only be described as an inappropriate relationship developing between a main character and a young girl which is meant to be but which comes off as you have freshman community college movie school special effects with 
 for a mature man to admit that he shed a over this film is a mature response to a mature one need admit more then perhaps one could say that life can never be the same after such advent for it has moved us to the next level 
 this is a film which had me thus far but now that i 've watched it emerges as one of the major in the style as usual with the format the was far from ideal by the video and mostly audio but given that the film is still unavailable on this will have to do for the moment since the film 's reputation is quite high within the itself i assume that the reason behind this oversight is because it 
 this film was shot in county in central north carolina in N when a film crew in the state was a rare thing the locations were the municipalities of liberty and and the surrounding rural it is not a particularly good movie it did have and it brought life to the for a few plot is standard the is that stuff that came out of the late and early the local folks were to be a part of the viewers 
 the elite team that has inserted or so earlier have instead of in and making them decided to take cover behind a big rock in one of the first scenes when the hero runs to rescue his wife he actually when inside a building and aiming for a target only some away the hero uses his scope besides the fact that most elite soldiers would make that shot from the and still hit there is also the fact that the 
 listening to the at the moment the images come back with a that makes my for a dry eye very strong in order to be able to type this i 've seen it twice thus far and i should be for having seen it only 've seen all & studio films and they are invariably nothing less than except maybe for which was even in the up version too compared to the still their strength sometimes becomes their weakness as 
 correction the ending does not show ben for guys he is looking up language courses at the military in san francisco perhaps to join the war in as a many of the from ask tell have been they are now it major short supply ben also spoke russian this movie is a good time of life in but quite a bit of reality here mostly a good at social skills and the sad portrayal of grown up not developing beyond 
 this is what used to be this is a true classic i mean it is an musical based on an actual book there is a real plot to it and how many movies can that these days this belongs in an exclusive of true movie including does dallas deep and behind the green door i think the problem with movies these days is that it 's all about the and not about the movie alice in has of sex sure 
 i really wanted to love this show i truly the first time viewers get their own version of the the with the help of his james a good looking has the chance of love with N suitors or as they are referred to in the show the only problem is half of them are straight and james does n't know this if james picks a one they get a trip to new zealand and if he picks a straight one 
 this of a movie is one of those films that has a lasting long term effect on you i 've read a review or two from angry people who i guess are either republicans or child and their remarks speak of the films power to people with their own secrets no such piece of art has ever combined and in me before and that is the of the movie the of the movie and it 's performance by carr is 
 i found this on the shelf while and how can people possibly give this a N it 's not just that it 's supposed to be a redemption film i think because it does n't work on that level either weak plot bad dialogue terrible acting there 's just nothing there is decent but has nothing to work with and and especially are just terrible the plot especially the relationship between and makes no sense it seems like the writers

 i saw an early of this film in new york and i along with my friends and pretty much the entire audience were disappointed the movie was n't even so bad it was good it was as as a victim l. jackson looked surprisingly tired through most of it and the effects were it reminded me of one of those movies except the of this movie was not funny or even it all seemed flat and i 'm shocked to 
 personal taste rules when it comes to talking about movies such as this little way back in the the early i discovered this movie like so many released at the time night bad or even king the and on the back of the covers and course being of an age movies like that i have already mentioned as well as stuff like and the many others captured the and many years later i still remember some with and some with 
 this is one of those films that i remember being in the can for years before anything happening i do n't think it 's terrible but it 's not really good either baldwin was pretty good but the plot is it kind of at best the cast is pretty good in what they 're given but again you are only as good as the script baldwin this although i could have sworn he did n't direct all of it i

 not that all disney films are i saw of creek first and absolutely loved the film when i heard it had N i was i finally found a copy of this and watched it one night i do n't see how they can make a to a film the original is a about the monster and can scare anyone return is for kids and should not be watched by anyone i do n't remember the plot too well as it 
 i was surprised to discover michael moore or bill was n't involved with this movie an american leftist list of to with a distinct of democrats in hell and did n't make an appearance in hell but ronald reagan is in the same room with perhaps we 'll have to wait for these california spin doctors to butcher for them to show all of their pet political shots at politicians corporations and their lobbyists fox news even all the radical 
 william was to have directed this of moss hart 's hit broadway play with recruiting but his own military commitments intervened and it went to a most unlikely george the women 's director has a sure touch on the many of air corps training and he invests it with more than the generally allowed particularly in sure the and entirely white save for one recruit bunch of are and more than in real life and the about home and mom 
 this is the ultimate and i mean the ultimate classic the plot is good evil there have always been an of films that gray areas and not enough on the basic good against evil to account for the real cases of good against evil in the real world only recently have film makers tried to even the odds in real life well over half of situations are black and white but only a fraction of movies make it seem that

 the movie and acting are not bad and jay does a good job playing but the movie it 's to be a to a hit movie the makers of this clearly did not watch the original 's way or at least did not care about this movie is a which means the original movie has already laid out some history for us and this movie should end where the original begins or at least lead up to it not one 
 midnight is one of those films been proclaimed a with good reason it really is one of the films ever made in america its both valid yet entirely accessible and commercial no wonder it was a huge success when initially released but be warned its also one of the most films ever made the characters are and ultimately the should be for not giving us the hollywood ending something which was basically mandatory by the still this is why i 
 put quite simply this film is starts off simply looking like a study of a young girl and goes on to become a n't expect or this is psychological and just as he would also do in bernard rose manages to convey the that is not being time you watch this film you more about what 's happening and about how the two in this film have never been 
 leonard compared this film to a brooks comedy he was far too kind to ms. and far too to mr. brooks not even the brooks films are this and at least they 're funny this picture deserves a place on the list 
 hidden is notable for being the longest running star fan series while the production quality is not on a par with fan productions like or new hidden largely on story and in that regard it does very well has no physical sets instead actors are against a and the backgrounds inserted one of hidden 's greatest is the sheer volume of work they have produced one of the ways in which this is achieved is by the sets at the 
 this is absolutely one of our of tale of two boys who come from different but are as close as brothers is shot and from to the it never brilliant insight into a lost culture and a very good way to understand and this is also an tale in its own right it is both and and filled with and excellent performances from the cast and great technical skills behind the camera this really is film at its recommendation a 
 when you see and as you expect to find a well done movie but this was actually quite different representing as it did what i would describe as an early effort at science and both play scientists and respectively competitors to an extent until wins over with a demonstration that proves his great theory the science here was to say the least a bit rough around the thus science with the emphasis on the but somehow some sort of ray 
 and there are not many in history rouge seems to be a bit of a hope hope in and in life but to say only that may be could find the right way to tell the story of that judge and the but model perhaps that old and disappointing love affair will not be repeated 's the new couple with the young judge after the but what to say about this master of the camera you ca n't miss a 
 i was a big fan on alive ' when it got released even some months before i kept on telling my friend how this movie has a great story plot and perhaps a good one anyway this movie is somewhat below my plot has a great potential but how the story along with the acting and bad this film is a disaster the ghost does n't make any sense and including the killings its all just too creating a sense 
 stage often have a major fault they often come out looking like a film camera was simply placed on the stage such as night mother 's direction keeps the film alive which is especially difficult since the picture offered him no real challenge still it 's nice to look at for what it is the chemistry between michael and christopher is quite brilliant the dynamics of their relationship are surprising is as always and gets one of his few chances 
 is keeping me all the time they keep coming up with films never heard of now a very early film by the italian version of the always twice brilliant acted and directed never heard of either leads who were excellent clara as and especially as what a man more and attractive than anyone else on the screen in N his look was ahead of its time many male stars from the were probably inspired by him he should have been 
 there 's nothing much to the story a young woman some money from the vermont supermarket where she works decides to run away to florida where he has dreams of attending school with her friend and an odd couple on the highway if you remember the elderly couple from 's baby you have some idea of what these two are like bill has a face and is retired from the army is an now become a although we do n't

 this film has been on my wish list for ten years and i only recently found it on when my partner 's was given it he watched it at and was to learn that it was about my generation born in N and in N and he wanted to know more about it and me i borrowed it from him and watched it on my own and i all through it not only did it capture the the class the 
 i saw and liked the first two a lot really especially because the second is not just a try to make another one as good as the first and it 's a story standing alone you do n't have to know the first movie i liked that in the free movies the third here is absolutely i tried it with a friend of mine because we both liked the first two we decided to stop after a good half an 
 warning a really stupid movie about a group of young in italy that find an of with a one of them wears it and becomes by the spirit of a it 's killing time and several of his friends die under his to revive the waste of time for the viewers as the fine young in the movie leave their clothes on the is at best and the acting is terrible perfect for such a bad script 
 i saw arthur the tv series and the books years ago and never was of the show very much if you 're a fan of this sorry if i 'm it for you but this is actually what i think of people liked it but i school kids characters seemed to fought all the time especially and they were nice to each other frequently but gradually i got tired of arthur 's complaining attitude everyone and his sister however the 
 whoever thought that another home alone film would be a good idea should have their head examined same plot different kid more which leads to more endless in the the other two films were bad enough and this is where it hits rock bottom people may as well watch the other films for plot as it 's all identical 
 once said a way to a movie is to just make one and probably the strongest kind that could be made about ralph 's take on 's the lord of the has actually been made by peter jackson the recent to me are n't even total but they are given enough room with each book to breath in all the techniques crossed with classical to make them very good sweeping but as one who has not read the books i 
 very few movies have had the impact on american culture the way urban has god it was temporary but is almost in a class by itself as one of those that when you 're channels at N you just ca n't take your eyes off my top three are animal house and walking tall but that 's the point i remember urban hit the theaters and there were being opened on every corner men were sporting hats with their penny 
 as much as i have enjoyed the the movies three is definitely enough 's got the gold ' the final for the japanese with the impressive package is a fairly piece of but offers little new in terms of ideas taking a big step as far as is film opens with the appearance of a female ghost and looks as though it is going to explore territory something which might have taken the series in an interesting new direction unfortunately 
 the is a strange work among 's by N he had become well known as the star of action movies not only the in which he first made his name but also war films such as where and such as 's yet although the takes place during the american civil war and was made by don who had earlier directed in 's and was later the same year to direct him in harry it is not an action film in 
 other have described this movie as classic with use of stock and and character could be further from the this is classic but at its most stupid that the 's first is a radar station shown first from the air then on the ground but the station is from the air as on a with snow on one side and dark ground on the other side but when on the ground investigators visit the site it 's suddenly on a 
 i think this is a great version i came on here before to help me find which version i should use and i went to N and read a comment from users comment and then helped me to get this version i do not regret picking this version and neither will you i tried watching all the other versions and none matched up to it there is nothing like the book and trust me if you are reading the book 
 the affair is a very bad tv movie from the the team of robert and wood as she has and leads a existence as a pop song writer he 's an ambitious lawyer who is very and absolutely with her their affair such as it is is doomed from the start and she knows it but goes along with it anyway two things to watch for if you are trapped into watching this wood 's that is never no matter 
 as a parent of two N and N i have grave doubts about this show and all the shows aimed at first i am always that the living conditions of etc always make most houses look tiny and most people work hard all day to pay for living quarters less than half the size yet on these shows nobody is going or coming from work paying utility rent mortgage or insurance bills sweeping changing etc just walking in and out 
 in a way of time is a success story because the movie reaches its goal being seen by thousands but it fails at making them has had its success because the subject was an original way of considering the time travel forget about 's back to the future here comes the old france the knight and its nearly way of life full of pride funny thanks to the ancient words he uses can sometimes be but he keeps his honor 
 this production was quite well done for a television original providing a very appropriate original on swift 's work to make the frame story work well the film begins with home everyone who has read the book knows that will happen anyway the frame story of the book has 's confusion in sections for example he is that he will little people in england because he has just returned from a land of giants but the film has all the 
 a few ago i remember reading an by a film who briefly mentioned russell this wrote that the ' of the women ' that r. played lay partly in their ability to stand by their man even when he was n't worth it thought of this after watching of turner the same strength and style as russell in her portrayal of china blue she 's the object of for two men the played by anthony and a boy who 's 
 this movie was terrible i thought with all the some what decent actors it would be better do n't waste your time parker was awful she should stick to desperate paul is becoming a b actor the mess he made in the movie i could never be your woman was the of what i 'm saying and lake bell she was but definitely in need of some more acting watch just like with it was a better or any other 
 N minutes of this is and i love the old 's yes the plot is thing yes the lines are but whoever was at the helm of this was not a fan there is so much ' and i use that word with great that i wonder if it 's an old & episode i lost count of the number of times i noticed that makeup had missed a spot near the collar refusing to acknowledge that any time had 
 anyone who sees this film will notice that the makers threw a lot of money at this film it 's interesting they titled it the hole the production values are good for a short film the hole tries to look big budget and does in some ways but is hampered by the video format it was shot on i speculate if this was shot on it would look incredible and would the content somewhat many hollywood movies look good and 
 is extremely boring this is the basis of the show or ask extremely easy questions that a N year old could answer at an extremely slow pace this show lasts for N hours and they probably only play about N games in that period people may like this show because the hosts are eye candy but they 're completely is destroyed by the fact that they are so the show they mention that we need more players a million times 
 this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen unfortunately i am a movie and will rent any movie unless it 's not made for when looking at the box it says it is rated r for and some language where was the was their one good death scene where you actually saw i could have that if there had been some brief or some good dialogue there was n't even one or amusing line in this movie 
 the english translation of the title on the version of this film is of but i think that must be an error it should have been called of horrible acting horrible horrible story and horrible music all make this a horrible film best left in a horrible 
 the people who are this film are the real disappointments i am hoping at least that leonard will see some good $ $ out of this as his life savings were away by a manager a couple of years ago and he 's over N now but this film is simply terrible at the beginning leonard himself says he is not about his past and then for the next hour and a half the film all the worst elements of 
 i watched this immediately after seeing so anything would have been an improvement on top of that it stops me from N to N days later and its unfortunately the more i watched it the more i how well made danny 's original was and how much this movie influenced N weeks later one ca n't help how much the N franchise has dated this type of italian movie i was totally convinced N must have been made in N 
 this is without a doubt the most poorly thought out movie in history the by top are some of the most awful attempts to be funny in recorded history i am not familiar with his other work but if it is half as bad as this then i am just going to cry i give this movie N out of N billion stars and may god have on the of those responsible 
 the director is sweet as is his wife but their movie it has its moments and some pretty but there is too much of everything meets breaking the waves meets at the beach you walk away wanting to know more about the and about the girl who likes it best when nothing happens be it in movies or in real life instead you get a writer a actress and an with a heart of gold it feels like there 's 
 is a single with a little gun who and his boss at the paris police department is a who knows that even the police becomes sooner or later guilty that is what the film is all about and a at the place brings the plan from prison joins him and helps him against two tough guys who are after him because he took money while rico already took girl friend and left him very much alone for five years in 
 sad in every aspect this poor excuse for a career boost for was neither that nor the hit wanted it to be by N minutes and filled with embarrassing moments for everyone involved this film and N are proof that did not have any real control over the empire strikes back had n't been in a hit since he bowed out from bond in N but this did n't bring him back at all was released several months before this 
 i like and even dig the movement which some have claimed this a member of but this did nothing for me i willing to go a step further and label this one of the biggest let of my film watching young go around getting their out of one of the group starts to develop a about their when his kid sister nearly them in the act invariably the group turns on itself as the once friends begin fighting with each 
 this is a hollywood of a classic british film everything that made the original italian job entertaining has been out of this of a movie by and wayne powers and directed by f gary gray i am that kennedy martin the of the original film allowed his name to be used in the credits for this 's martin has worked on some of the film and tv projects of the last years even being associated with this is not a 
 it 's N and when you finally get to look at this film you will probably that it is dated but here 's the thing the was bold the exposure of the music industry at that time was as bold as well and it took some time for this to get music that was created by african americans to be on the same level as white acts in some cases it still is but back in the N 's this 
 it takes a rare movie to get better each time you see it brother does that and then some the first time i saw it i have to admit i had never seen anything like it then i wanted to see it again and now i 'm up to double with this great movie the brothers ' movie they 've ever done with fargo and proxy coming in a tight second and third for gives the performance of his career 
 you do realize that you 've been watching the exact same show for eight years right i could understand the initial of seeing on an island but you 'd think that after watching heroes run through the bush with an egg on a for half a decade would be enough to get you to commit to something a little more original and interesting i 'm not even speaking of the shows which for the record i find questionable it 's 
 like another ticket buyer i saw a nice about this film it 's five star review and won thought what the let 's by a ticket for myself and my two sons bad idea the movie was not a family film it was and it contained nothing worth watching 
 this movie is a love story set in the backdrop of war everything about the movie was perfect i just saw the movie yesterday and i want to get my own and watch it many times over the story ends as it started i was very happy that he came back and i was proud of her for becoming a doctor and her father 's dream she her father and her the character had many christian is also an actor 
 i was enough to meet george and still have my by him at a convention shortly after the release and asked him why he chose to do the film camp before he could answer two studio and me on how the studio knew best and how no one will take such a film seriously i had been reading the for a couple of years thanks to a friend of the will recall and his band i was in a couple 
 someone had a great idea let 's have do her own version of two guns not only in but as well it was indeed a great idea the problem is that the people who had it could n't come up with any sort of script or budget to support it therefore we get a film that barely reaches medium length by many of its parts often in and was apparently shot entirely inside a garage the appeal of is still 
 i watched this film during a special advanced in reading two main characters michael and strike up a friendship when is introduced to the care home that michael already michael is to find someone who can finally understand him as until now his made people think that he could n't michael to the life that he 's missing is a character who does n't let his condition get to bond and apply for independent living and find a lovely flat 
 me and my friend read the and watched the and were very interested and excited to go rent this movie bad idea we thought a movie with actors that influential would have been a sure hit but our expectations fell extremely short first of all the and are misleading to the point of lies the movie started out slow for the first N hours reminder its about two hours long and when it finally started to gain momentum it plus 
 i am a huge fan and i ordered the movie from just so i could see it without waiting forever for it to come to the u.s. i really should have saved my money what is with anne running after the whole point of anne 's character is that she was quiet and refined she is not and and mary was she suffering from a or something her speech was n't normal nor was her walking normal there was no 
 it has taken me a while to watch this version as unfortunately i do n't seem to be able to rent it in the video store only the other version but i fell in love with it i was always with the other and as they are not british naturally have to put on the and well to me it does n't seem natural it seems put on sorry but do n't think and did a brilliant job there i 
 much better than expected good family catch it on reruns the whole is more than the sum of its parts paul up the he has way more talent then the role deserves a treat to watch inspector from the go over the top the blue man scenes had my N year old in the were particular fun for the parents nice to see lee and again it 's going to be tough to think up N lines for this film 
 i wasted N minutes of my life on this turkey before i gave up the main character is completely and but there is no humor in his as soon as he in germany the pulls the old there 's only one room in the hotel you 'll have to share a room with a pretty girl come on at least you could let them develop their relationship a bit first watch it happened one night to see how to do 
 i hate football i hate football fans i hate cars but this film was the thing i have seen in quite some time i was given the great opportunity to see this film at the weekend and all i have to say is i till i and when is it going to be available in the and this is one football film you will need to see its the fact that this film started out as some crazy commercial for

 what i hate most in this garbage is the arrogant attitude of the film makers and network who this nonsense on the public because they really think the audience is so stupid so so as to deserve these kind of there is an inherent entertainment is seeing disaster movies and with the magic of today 's effects artists are given powerful tools to explore what before was denied them with that we sat down to watch some and destruction well 
 oh f hell where should i start first of all this show is just another stupid american so called comedy which has acting and very very poor humor the american way of business makes the whole thing even worse how come i can hear yet there 's nothing funny happening pretty stupid this show is only for those american people who have n't ever heard that there are far more better and not only in great but also in america 
 this is a piece of you can tell when you are watching a be mafia film and this is it this made no sense at all start at the beginning of his life were all over the place and the term even exist until wrote the book then the real mafia borrowed the phrase and made it their own after the movie this piece of would have one thinking that the phrase representing the mafia don was used back in 
 this was an good historical drama john is excellent as the and the character 's manic such as his strange watson is fine in her support role as the sensitive between and near is well by and familiar such as ' ' are evident in this film i think i will now go on to read the novel it was a and ending and it was hard to keep a dry eye brilliant movie 
 this movie reminded me a lot of a song by the dead called straight a 's however unlike this film the hero of the 's song turns to you 'll wish this had to killing himself instead of doing the crime he did the whole thing was and in the beginning you with the hero of the film then he quickly your the long of just showing the hero 's face while he a drag the film down quite a 
 the story is seen before but that matter if you can figure out to make a proper it is clear that the director have n't spent his work on the alongside this the spent far too much time that do not match the message of the movie the is however if you take a look at the movie 's you can read that it was on purpose that the director has chosen to make the film with bad camera because 
 i this because i 'm a big science fan but this thing i wo n't call it a film because it was obviously shot very quickly on video seemed like they made it up as they went along i 'm still not sure what it was about there 's these guys dressed up in some weird s & and i guess they 're from another planet anyway not much makes sense in this low low low budget film if it 
 after first work which was fairly good he created a really italian family its a german movie which is unfortunately a bad cause we produce more than moderate movies but this movie makes some very good of the time then is about a italian who in the region of germany during the the and his family then start the first pizza restaurant in the region the characters are excellent drawn especially the main actor you live every second every feeling 
 my watch came a little too late but am glad i watched both this and the together which makes me the makers of this for giving such a pure and basic treatment to the idea of and very marginally it from the idea of relationships as a lot has been written about the movie already it would just be appropriate to highlight few portions of the movie which i personally think the point where and make phony phone calls to 
 worst mistake of my picked this movie up at target for $ N because i figured it 's i can get some cheap i was wrong completely wrong through the film all three of my friends were and i was still suffering worst plot worst script worst movie i have ever seen i wanted to hit my head up against a wall for an hour then i 'd stop and you know why because it felt damn good upon my 
 i watched this film version of 's classic novel as a substitute until the N a & e version was released on video and what a poor it proved to be this version does not have the aspect of the a & e movie the actors are for the most part wooden with the exception and the seems forced and in fact there is no until the end of the movie the between john or lady whichever you prefer and 
 even allowing for my love of the first two films in the franchise and sweeping away any sort of i might of had for the character of max i just ca n't bring myself to rate at average this waste of space that so nearly what had gone before is the nasty streak that brought feeling to the character mad max gone is the feeling of in an world and more gone is director george miller 's passion for the 
 a lot of people this movie but that i blame on two facts N they want it to be too much like the first couple of american pie movies and N they are trying to take it too one i found was the best one out of all six and i absolutely love the plot is predictable i 'll say that but then what comedy is n't road trip etc etc they are all predictable but still funny i say 
 if this movie were any worse it would have been directed by this mess makes ed wood look like it has been a while since i have seen this pile but i do remember that i wanted to do harm to all those involved how anyone can give this movie any more than N star me to the of all those that viewed this i give it one star because there is not a rating lower all copies of this 
 this movie was chosen quite frankly as a in a from our local video store it turned out to be quite a the plot as it and predictable the actors constantly looked embarrassed to be the poorly written lines the only funny moment in the entire film around the dangers of smoking and the of an the remainder of the film lacked the to either of my young daughters aged less than ten years myself my wife my or even 
 a very and exciting that does n't rely on action but on situation which is all to rare these days i would compare this film to the day of the another film about the pursuit of a dangerous international criminal the acting across the board is has a tricky double role as the vicious terrorist carlos and as the navy man who him donald plays the cia agent who him ben plays the israeli officer who in the plan this 
 this is possibility the worst and most disappointing film i have ever seen i 've spent four years at two universities and know that there must be a good film to be made about the experience this is n't it the acting is god awful and the plot are a few incidents from my one year in halls of a that got off with a N the best friend of two one with huge and the other with the the

 than this what would happen if terry and douglas adams would have worked together on one movie this movie starts with a touch of brazil when at a certain point the story moves straight into the zone bringing up nothing new but just nothing and nothing is great fun when dave and andrew starts to explore their new environment the movie gets really heads well yes anyway this movie was the biggest surprise at this year 's just like in 
 how do you describe and tony practically dance on the screen and give performances that stay with you hours after you 've left the theatre every scene in the film with the powerful combination of and shot selection acting and the king in french absolutely sets the tone for the whole movie and tony look with about in some truly and tony always looking i 've seen this movie several times already and i see it i find something new 
 i just want to add my two cents worth and me if i am something that has already been posted but i feel it is worth people of the ' of without the street of this film would never have been made nor most of the other great that deal with & the like from before worked as a newspaper man and he was from colorado but he sure did the street scene of the east coast if you are 
 or black in english was a disappointment i was told that it was a sort of japanese version of the imagine my disappointment the film was either badly dubbed or the did n't time well with the film another thing is that the dialogue was pretty much bad there was very little thought put into the english version of this film and it appeals only to the action not a film i would want to see again

 albert and tom are brilliant as sir and his of course the play is brilliant to begin with and nothing can compare with the and of theatre and i think you listen better in theatre but on the screen we become more intimate we 're ' more than we are in the theatre we witness changes in expression we see better as well as listen both the play and the movie are moving illuminating of the story of the company 
 i am a motion picture production major at wright state university in ohio and yesterday i was given the opportunity to watch this film in class we were informed by our professor that it would be very funny to us but the reason we were watching it was because it was one of the first sound films a complete problem with early sound films was that hollywood actors only knew how to do silent movies and they were n't good 
 i would recommend this for anyone who is an of the late john and for those who have never known of it is an excellent film i really do n't have the time to go into the details of why this is my opinion but if you 're looking for something with lots of scenes to over then this one is for you the is perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of the film as well as the story 
 i wait for each new episode each with anticipation the new look of created by is a wonder that i hope will never end to combine the past with the future is a new twist that is to me season # N should be a in itself i wish that richard dean anderson would show up more often in the new season as i love his dry as much as his in his character as jack the other characters add 
 i have seen so many bad low budget films lately but this one is great the very realistic portrayal of police life in a city on the east german coast is a strong contrast to other crime movies or series i loved the main actress and the rejection of any about the police this film is realistic like a and entertaining like a drama at the same time a perfect 
 i just saw hot millions on and i had completely forgotten this creates a and divisive plot that has him going from two bit con man to well you 'll see smith is perfect as the who has a tough time holding a job but has a warm and that through in this picture she creates a fine portrayal of a warm and real person who in the long run well and as top executives take on the challenge of 
 keep in mind i 'm a fan of the but have only recently seen this film for the first time how i 've it all this time is a wonder to me to me this is a better film then the much high noon it 's a great western with excellent acting and a great story the is in black and white with outstanding if you like or james stewart this film is not to be missed 
 in a way you have to respect it 's clearly meant as a to the big movies of the and while the special effects look terrible at least the film does n't feature however on the other hand you ca n't respect the film too much because it 's a load of the acting is terrible the special effects as mentioned are impossible to take seriously and once you 've seen one giant being up you 've seen them all 
 film is designed to affect the audience and this film left me and well acted with that approaches the film involves hate murder rape theft and it an intense that left me unable to take my eyes off the screen until the closing credits the story is sweeping it takes the audience from the of the spanish civil war to the human left behind roger and bruno are two young actors who command the screen supporting players are cast and 
 this is another notorious mexican film however while the original version is quite all sorts of and were inserted for the prepared by who did similar duties on the dr. and like the u.s. version of that film had previously been available on through something i watched the original first and while no great it was fairly engaging especially with a plot as familiar as this one was a doctor goes beyond the call of duty in attempting to save 
 peaceful robert sterling is on the losing side of a range war with his neighbors that is until notorious robert shows up out of the blue to level the playing field soon he begins to go too far feeding a growing sense of in sterling especially when his son begins to the is a and surprisingly tough little picture with a great performance by here he comes across as an evil version of that is until the real nature of 
 i 'd have to say that this was a little embarrassing for the of the cowboys ' made in N the picture came out a decade after roy rogers ' earliest pictures in which he had a role roy 's character comes off as a bit in this one along with his female who her between roy and robert portraying chief bad guy bill the whole story seems kind of with missed opportunities for what could have been an entertaining 
 as a huge fan or the series i have been waiting N years for the next addition this episode i 'm afraid just does not live up to the returns to after N years for his daughters and gets involved in a murder investigation were a by backs from his tour of duty in northern goes on a killing i did not like about this episode is the extremely convenient way it is all set up and how is led 
 a in the life of one of the first female to achieve historical tells the true story of a young italian woman 's pursuit of artistic expression and the she the film features and sets and a good cast and acting however it is in its attempt to the of the art and the time and is in its representation of the passion of the artist as painted on and through her with men a good film for those interested 
 it was a good story but not very well told i liked the themes and the main story line which was n't as clear as it could have been maybe there was too much going on and a lack of ability to it all in the acting was to some were stronger than others and even the stronger actors had their moments of lesser quality acting it took me a couple of months to get through the entire movie because 
 bill 's is not an attack on organized it 's an attack on and apart from a bunch of machines to get around regulations he really does n't attack and seems when a actually challenges the existence of the state of israel if bill followed his to its logical conclusion he would realize that the very creation of israel in the palestinian is based on the so called books ' of organized this is evidence of his complete and lack 
 i just wondering what is the purpose of making movies like this the profit and to whom they are referring what intelligence must use your brain to watch something like this this movie is by under N years old children if you are adults do n't try to watch it the reason i think hollywood started to use in movies with actors like this you must forget the art of be sure that you have tons of pop corn to 
 although credit should have been given to dr. for stealing the of the egg this was a fine film it touched both the and the due especially to the incredible performance of seven year old justin henry and a script that was sympathetic to each character and each one 's the thought elements long after the ones are over overall superior acting from a solid cast excellent and a very powerful script the right of humor throughout help keep a 
 it 's easy to see why many people consider in the mood for love to be 's best film the down appeal of the film on the studied view of a relationship put through an emotional ringer is a into happy together territory but without the of film stocks and that have become a trademark of 's films since express like 's the this is a different kind of for where dialogue and plot are by mood and in order 
 i decided to watch this on on demand for free because i figured well nothing else looks and it turned out to be quite a good little surprise the film serves as an of four urban told from the point of view of four whose car breaks down in the middle of nowhere after they decide to build a in the woods they begin to tell their stories and the movie to the events in the a couple traveling cross 
 in the takes the son to new levels of low this is a movie that serves no purpose the plot is out in the first few minutes there is no the characters are and despite plot that try to and everything plays out exactly as you think it will through the movie i could no longer stand the pace and started fast the movie ended exactly as i expected linda hamilton is great as always and the other actors are 
 planet is the best film from the golden age of and what makes it a great film is its sense of wonder as soon as the the audience via the ships human crew through an and sometimes we meet the the his beautiful and innocent daughter and we learn about the former of the planet the who died out overnight or did they you can and say the planet is obviously in a movie studio with painted but that adds 
 an interesting companion piece to true of john c. holmes unfortunately it does n't deal with what ultimately killed holmes and it certainly could have benefited from doing so burt reynolds and mark got the most for this but i felt the true stars were moore as the mother don as a black man struggling with identity as in some wild and william h. macy who 's wife is the ultimate not to mention a nearly alfred macy 's new 
 in this film but then she was an awful ' anyway unfortunately she everyone else including then life down the drain with her but what was thinking when he agreed to star in this one one read of the script should have told him that this one was going to be a real it 's an exceptionally weak story basically no story or plot at all add in poor acting even from the normally good there 's absolutely no action 
 i watched this movie last week sometime and had the biggest i 've had in a long while the plot of the film is pretty and in a badly way the only plus to be found anywhere in the film are 's impressive paul i think that 's her name is as the 's wife who has a history of depression ted is gross and his character 's a on top of it all and as if the fact that 
 do not waste your time or your money on this movie my it because she thought it was the other movie called the about some travelers who get trapped in a so we decided to watch it thinking it could n't be that bad it was i ca n't believe this movie was actually produced and put out to the public it was so horrible it was almost like an accident scene where you want to look away but you 
 my first child was born the year this program came out and i played the record for the boys every christmas thereafter when the cd came out i bought about ten copies and still give them to friends and as they start families it invariably becomes their favorite christmas i recently found several 's made on from video tapes probably for sale on the one i bought was an excellent copy and it was so great to see the show 
 at least it 's not full of violence or it 's also not very full of thought or a smooth this story had some potential but the director appears to have lost site of the green the story is and goes off in to no conclusion i also do n't believe the director spent much time around a golf country club either some of the are absurd not very engaging 
 i 've barely just made it through one episode end the was and worthy the acting was despite his best attempts to be dramatic remains mostly his hint at a recent treatment could have just as easily been playing the in in a silent movie the characters were each playing their in the plot mostly random plot special effects can be given the tv budget but attempts to create and surprise through added to the i get the feeling that 
 finally and in their own film lion king N ' is an new take on a classic tale which classic tale you ask why lion king ' of course if there 's one thing that disney is never short of it 's that does n't mean that this is n't a good film it 's basically the events of lion king ' as told from and 's perspective and it 's because of this that you 'll have to know 
 ok this movie is stupid i mean that in a good way was stupid on purpose and was one of the better stupid movies i 've seen the jokes and are bad but delivered in a way that it struck all the right notes with me the supporting characters were pretty and there is a pretty weak plot but it works just 's character is the focus is and has a world of acting talent that just in this top 
 this movie is stupid made by stupid people the plot i works well enough for a movie but the actions these characters take is stupid like stupid to the degree basically the whole movie consists of these N being captured repeatedly despite having many many easy ways and opportunities to overcome their it does not make one of sense and is not entertaining yourself in the eye is more is more rational and probably more fun than watching this the 
 forget plan N this is the ultimate a drama directed acted etc this film is based on 's novel i hate and antonio in films and the other actors including my actress and try hard to get over such a terrible script plenty of mistakes like for example since when does it snow in in chile and very with tons of that evil named magic this stands out as the worst movie of all time it totally 
 the to creating a good solid mystery story is as much a matter of timing as its about plot characters or surprising anyone who has ever in frustration with an sunday new york times knows that any that takes too long to solve to be any fun the best murder be they on film or in print are slight affairs that get to the point out their clues line up their suspects and hopefully us with a few surprises being 
 obviously this one does n't aim for the brain the so-called is based on and every about any ethnic you can imagine included of course as long as they are not and a this besides john does have talent and but in such a movie it is a waste what the point in trying to jim himself the of the title could then be this movie almost as funny as 's prepare to be not 
 i did n't have many expectation going into the film but i thought it was is outstanding in a very different role he has dumped the suits for a ridiculous look and pays off showing that he is an excellent actor and play off each other great and make for one of the better buddy in a long time the humor is dark the performances by and hope davis are great mix that with a element to the story about 
 a group of friends decide to take a trip into the find themselves and murdered by a killer in a black truck mirage is obviously inspired by 's and craven 's the hills have eyes this offers plenty of nasty violence and film 's highlight is a involving a man having his arm and leg together around a tree and then having his when the chain is pulled by a is also a little bit of and some exciting acting 
 the house of the spirits is quite awful i live in south america in a country that suffered a military just like the one the movie tries to describe and even though everyone knows movies may be far far away from reality this particular movie viewers as both and stupid things are not so simple and linear as appears here and of course political process are much more complicated and interesting that the plot in the house if you ca 
 one of my favorite movies of all time done well written and well acted it portrayed N something blacks in a way i do n't think has yet been and the so makes me want to find love like that 
 given the low budget and production limitations this movie is very good it is realistic and shows how the who lived on the plains their lives to save a american pilot from the and we are drawn into strong feelings for the young yet highly boy who the american pilot if you 're looking for special effects heroes and this movie is not for you if you want to feel what it must have been like to dodge the persistent 
 when hear two popular will be fighting they to the theaters to see how the battle will end there 's vs. in which two very popular try to kill each other and more similarly to this there 's vs. name here but the very generic vs. is just a horrible title and an even worse obviously the movie 's a picture but at least come up with a more compelling name maybe something that can the into watching it with 
 i first heard about this film about N years ago when i was a kid in grade school it just so happened that i was through the in the classroom one day and under the entry for movies or i do n't remember were several for different movies from mainstream to experimental and one of them shown on the page was a still for it really me since it stood out the most on the page it was a still 
 when i 'd seen the name of this movie i 'd always thought it was a musical like the it 's not it 's a that hit the kitchen ceiling and was off and together no music and not a period piece but starts with james woods telling the of his three daughters a small child who grows to be barbara that she must maintain the family name and thus think it is going to be a historical tale and 
 for fans only there are two N numbers that are really good one where she does a number with an older cleaning lady you 've all seen the and a pretty good number at the very end there are a couple of scenes where the lines are funny but basically the script is so bad and the movie so dated that it 's hard not to at the throughout but it 's worth the to rent the movie just be

 sure it 's hard being especially in the south we get it over and over stood out was that the film makers focused almost wholly on the more extreme characters in these small town bars the drag the of a bar and on a guy who was murdered for being yet had nothing to do with either of the bars which were the focus of this were of interviews from other people people viewers would perhaps be better able to 
 it 's difficult to not have a for israeli director fox and for his movies which describe the life in the middle east and the inherent problems people can have in these regions besides he also gave voice to the young generations and to the remarkable part of them who really need peace and who want to take no further notice of a war that for too much time marked the of people both in israel both in these reasons 
 jack was one of the actors that had ever the screen he could switch from dramatic roles to with ease making most of his green with envy while his performance in save the tiger is i feel it was given to him as he had missed out on his other opportunities to win the award due to other better roles that had this current is also one of those movies that comes out to basically the talent of the cast 
 i saw it at just one night after its first public projection in paris a very pretty film about three N years old all of them just at about the same stages many of the scenes let us to come back to our age & our first feelings about sexual relations it is possible to imagine that the director would like to reduce the first strong feelings of the to but even in that case she does n't corrupt the

 i started watching this because i thought it was a really as i kept watching the only i got from this movie was finding out what the name of it was so i could look it up and on it i just finished it and have considered ending my life knowing that someone actually made this the people who on this movie as having a good script and great acting my words of wisdom for you are that you probably 
 i was surprised at how a movie could be both and excellent at the same time the flying was beyond especially when landing yet the specially effects when the attacked were for a film that was made over half a century ago living in the middle east i saw of in when adams suggested should dress more modestly and as an engineer was by the used for the ' and up by the department all in all an entertaining hour

 in the sea of that hollywood and others continue to put out this is one of those diamonds in the rough a small simple movie that is very entertaining and leaves you with the feeling that you did n't just waste an hour and a half of your is really quite amazing in this movie i had never really been a fan or had noticed her before but going back and seeing this early performance of convinced me she 's

 there are but trust me i 'm doing you a friends and i like to watch movies every so often inspired by mystery science theater and our for on the spot jokes we set out to find movies worth watching that are in fact not worth watching however trouble comes into when these movies can only be found if you buy them and i am a firm in not giving one cent to such a group of so as another 
 when i first saw this movie i had thought that it was going to be a terrible upset being directed by first-time director what i saw in the next N minutes completely and utterly changed my mind based on the novel by jonathan everything is tells the story of a young played by wood who is trying to find the woman who saved his from the in he to germany and in the help of a club hitting and his

 many experienced and excellent actors mixed together in an ongoing plot of an part of world war ii on the eastern front characters well portrayed and one episode leaves you for the next pay attention to the closing credits were the thousands of are listed an story involving hundreds of thousands of individuals sometimes sometimes romantic always filled with real people and produced with excellent sets and camera work heroes and criminals and and portrait of people struggling to survive

 it helps that the characters this show is based on are among the best disney has ever come up with the writing is what really makes this show it 's a total classic given you need to appreciate the type of humor to enjoy it and this is hard to explain the humor is to the old school scenarios of N 's and N 's disney with modern it never into jokes or anything of that type it 's not 
 this is simply put the worst movie i have ever seen it ranges from like hours and the box art was totally misleading my friends and i it because we thought it would be a poor man 's you know to at and make fun of no there is nothing funny about this movie only pain then the movie starts up and they are speaking some sort of different language we think its just the beginning ' but no from 
 watching this series will probably make you feel like how our parents felt when watching star for the first series has it all the kind of stories that makes you forget how to the kind of characters that makes you want to jump into the tv to join the action and the kind of atmosphere that makes your hair in and endless short we start out with john an who gets shot into a and ends up with a gang 
 that 's right under N on average but maybe under for some others i was N when i originally saw this on video and at such youth i was n't able to notice the or the fact that those classic characters we have all grown to love are not the same or as good to see just about everything is so here is i 'll agree not even beautiful but just a woman with skin she wears the same bright

 let me just give you guys some advice if your going to watch this movie just to see a bunch of characters get in a dozen different ways then you are going to love this movie because everyone dies a horrible death beyond the however there is not much should i start characters do not appeal to the audience as there are no back stories for any of them there for i did n't feel connected to any of them 
 good western in the rocky arizona lots of tough guys throughout 's character seemed to rock back and forth between a and a laid back type several appeared in the picture but not enough to offset it being exciting and worth seeing one really scene shows cases of their and collecting it in a for the purpose of starting a fire a. to gather that much he would have needed a pack to carry the b. the was obviously dry

 it seems more than passing strange that such as of and the hills have eyes the new version can find distributors while older and far superior works such as this film are nowhere to be found with all the debate about the or lack of and interest in consider the multiple jack and mission impossible productions this would seem to be an obvious choice for release on true it looks like a N motion picture because it is a N

 after buying the in a bargain due to the impressive amount of features listed on the cover i it in the player and everything looked good nice and a whole lot of extra features but when i played the movie itself what a let down it is the worst thing i have ever seen and i have seen some bad movies in my time the comment that the movie here at is actually from the people who made the film

 i wonder why this film was ever made a set in a version of berlin where all germans speak english with a german and all speak english with some words in between is hardly credible the english is basically limited to you and the acting is worse than anyone can imagine apart from this racial in germany can be an interesting subject but in the germany i know there are no gangs shooting each other in the middle of the 
 i love this movie it was one of my favorite movies the action never stops the whole movie was done very well the ending is really good of it being action filled they even have a surprised put in there for you when i saw what the movie was about on the i was kind of not sure if i wanted to see this movie but sense i am such a big fan i decided to give it a chance 
 bogart in his first role looks very young acts well but has a only hinted at later in his career still he 's very good and very appealing as the young inventor of a new is the real star here playing a woman who 's torn between her real love for bogart he 's broke too and the comfort and security of an older man hamilton for the ride are as bogart 's sister bradley page as her would-be producer 
 this film had the of being released at the same time of the highly popular both having the wonderful playing the central role the director made one of the most films that have come out of france in recent film deals with chance as its english title indicates the french title makes reference at how wings can create chaos over the atlantic as they fly as well as in the pacific something not to be believed just by looking at 
 when i sat down in the to see this i was expecting to see a sort of action film which had been implied by the however it very quickly became apparent that this film was trying to be i do n't approve of films that try to in as many ways possible for instance this film tries to mix action with comedy and all at once most of the time this sort of approach does n't work in films just 
 there have been a lot of films made over the decades but it 's a shame that one of the best is probably one of the least 's fighting is a bit different from other films first off it 's a republic serial in N and this time is not played by a top studio star like douglas power or antonio but instead by actor reed while does not cast as strong a presence over the proceedings as those other 
 i watched this movie a couple of weeks ago and must say i was not impressed not at all i do side with the other when it comes to the fine performances but some good performances do not make a good the discussion board i found a review by an that captured some of the main points it says poll ' is a movie that raises many questions but hardly answers even a few a movie that is disturbing and

 well this is about as good as they come there are arguments about whether was only a master of commercial or maybe a or was he really deep nobody knows precisely what terms like that mean but it 's legitimate to ask if at his best he could not have been all three things at this one he seems to be about at his peak hardly anything in it is it with doubt and and the story is apparently having

 opening night released in N tries to be an ambitious production it succeeds only in the truly stunning performance of her character of theatre actress is not necessarily someone we would love in real life she is often and makes life for those around her in other words not unlike some is also a woman on the edge of collapse we are not quite sure if the she is fighting are real or although we are let in on the 
 sure the plot is n't it seems the only great movies these days are or in some kick is a about a group of people who decide to pour their hearts into do regardless of what you expect from this film you 're guaranteed to feel moved by the work pain and expectations that the characters force themselves to experience though at times many moments and characters are there 's the old guard character who takes things too seriously the 
 in N charlie began making pictures these were made for mack also known as studios and were literally out in very rapid succession the short had very little structure and were completely ad as a result the films though popular in their day were just awful by today 's standards many of them bear a strong similarity to home movies featuring for the camera many others show the characters in front of the camera and do pretty much nothing and 
 whose previous films such as the circle and gold have seemed to range from to grim has produced in his new a funny chaotic piece that ends on a note of liberation and fun yet the movie deals with material quite as challenging and relevant as anything else he 's done by focusing on a group of girl fans caught into the cup match in stadium brings up issues of national spirit and and the and sheer of the regime 
 i or in english on the strength of director 's later effort the others based on what a measured and effective that film was i assumed his earlier efforts would be of a similar quality and i was in the mood for some good instead i wound up with the most excuse for a movie i 've seen since the german film which this one reminded me of plot has potential but it 's thrown away within the first N 
 one would think that since this film has a bad rep that i would be when i say i this i 'm am serious this movie was just so stupid and so and such a waste of mean after the first N i had a major and the i had on my face that was mostly getting ready to was wearing this film was over i was so glad and because i had good expectations that it would be funny 
 having heard quite positive reviews and having seen the i had to see this movie with william h. macy luis guzman michael and sam rockwell present it had to be good and it delivered overall the movie is not funny but there is one scene that really stands out and is in a my eyes a classic at the end where they break through the wall to get to the safe and we see rockwell and washington at is just 
 i was one of about N people that was lucky enough to see an early of this follows a young man on a to find a fallen star and bring it back to the woman he in order to prove his love for her the only catch is that the star has fallen on the other side of the wall a between england and a kingdom known as film was just a to watch it has something in it for 
 i heard what people were saying but i ignored them being rushed at blockbuster i grabbed copy of this movie and ran out N minutes into i was fighting to stay there is some attempt to keep the film interesting but it was just bad a chase of some sort takes place but it was long and drawn out the perfect time to make a by the time this movie was over i did n't care how ended i just 
 when i watched this movie it was an afternoon after i got home from work i love movies and have seen some really ones but this takes the the plot presented to the in the beginning of the movie seems a little intriguing but as the movie the script makes a wrong turn with horrible and bad presentation which in turn makes the movie completely and boring i do n't mean to keep the script and plot because believe me 
 this universal has just been announced as an release but intended as part of a collection of similar movies that i already had in my i decided to acquire it from other channels rather than wait for that legitimate release which is just as well since the end result was not anything particularly special if atmospheric at that for the plot is pretty weak even though in a way it anticipates the vincent price vehicle theatre of blood N without

 this is the worst and i mean the worst computers based movie i have ever seen the whole plot is totally and full of i mean the guy in this movie can actually speak with computer as a real person now you probably think this must be some cool high-tech computer well it is but he does it also with other very poor and weak computer which does not even have the main idea how to the computer by connecting 
 this movie was really funny even though it was n't meant to be the acting was stupid and so were the voices pretty much all it was was some guy walking around a corn for an hour and a half they threw in this stupid natural thing that made it even it was n't even like a normal movie this weird music was playing almost the whole way through the movie what is it with corn films children of the 
 what an absolutely movie the cast is wonderful and the story is and fun an all around movie experience although the plot is somewhat predictable it does n't make the story any less in fact i did n't want it to end i 've always been a fan and i was interested to see her in a role she did n't let me down 's performance as is fun to watch i loved her with at the music store as 
 it was jon who said it s very difficult to be funny but very easy to be silly well if that s the case faces is very easy david baker as director and his cast seem to be under the impression that comedy involves stealing scenes and style from superior like lock stock and using a completely script and jumping up and down speaking in a very fast voice very alan especially from this type of performance but not enough

 the down upon ' law 's base present an adequate to describe how truly terrible this movie is first off let me state right off the bat that i doubt that paramount will ever recover any money from this film a hit it might become but only because it is so remarkable for what it failed to achieve i can see the studio pitch now let 's combine N 's german and a N 's with a modern action and 
 i did not really want to watch this one it seemed to be an old movie which me even before i started watching it because i do n't consider him even close to being as a the only reason i took this one is obviously the khan appearance in the film i had not even known what the film was all about because i was sure it would be just an ordinary tale so i just a love story between 
 while the story of a troubled kid turning to for and anger management is hardly a new thing the story is given a fresh twist here when the is a girl instead of a has trouble at school she just ca n't stay away from fighting at home her father is constantly putting her down her brother trains at a and one day when she picks him up she decides she also wants to would be easy to call this 
 this is based on the ideas of the original N 's hit it 's set in the modern day as we see a base in afghanistan get destroyed by a right at the that 's exactly where the movie the 's are n't armed they could be but i do n't think it 's ever been tried for real we get to see the computer that has this operation called we are introduced to hacker will farmer he 's good

 by far the worst movie of all time even could not save this turkey i have heard that the movie was originally supposed to be titled the but was changed to ' in order to take advantage of the excitement created by i think were in one scene of this movie the fact that they happened to be included in this was supposed to sell tickets did n't work anytime something good happens in the movie the ship 's crew 
 a film that theatrical release this movie is a that the technique of michael with contemporary music tightly integrated to the images always with mr. the of impact by the music is almost as if there is an actor added to the of cast writer director and film is definitely one of my all time while nothing is perfect this film comes very very with an excellent script great direction and acting by richard there is an of character actors 
 this has got to be the worst case of over acting since the silent era not just one or two actors but virtually the entire cast lee and were fine but the rest of them look like their first time the budget was not tremendous much of the and set were but there were many things that jump out at the to let us know that they could n't double check or get all of the to match the ca 
 latter days for me was a very moving film it showed just how hard and the community really is the film true passion and really the feelings of these two characters the film holds a real of for the community as it really speaks out for the personally i think it 's about high time that the homosexual community of all should no longer hold there head in shame just for being there beautiful the film was very much of 
 this is one of those movies where i wish i had just stayed in the film is quite frankly boring what story there is is very and you pretty much have to guess at it the film itself with camera techniques that seem intent on causing and makes it look like a student film did i say it was boring already if all the characters had suddenly died at the end of the movie i would not have less as 
 well the writing was very sloppy the was and the made it worse at least i hope it was the the acting was n't bad but it was n't that good either pretty much none of the characters were at least N minutes of that movie was wasted time and the other hour or so was not used anywhere near its full potential it was a great idea but yet another wasted good idea goes by it could have ended 
 i saw N days ago and i found it an excellent production the film is supposed to and it does it the style of the american of the but von is more refined and are simply excellent in their roles the plot is simple the film starts with people involved in many situations that apparently should have nothing to do between them it is very funny how those situations become linked during the film it is good to see a 
 if you like poor some bad acting and a total lack of credibility this is a movie for you so a really cheap looking movie but i liked it anyway why because i like those kind of movies i ca n't help but when i see these kind of movies what were the producers actors director and people thinking when they made this film do n't expect an or just a very is one nice moment when a guy 's 
 i sat with my children as we watched this film we all found it to be a very entertaining goes to a new school a fifth grade starts stuff with him and this is what leads to the eating of bet is made and has only so much time to eat N or else from this point the and his friends try to come up with nasty ways to cook or the to try and get sick so that he 
 as a big fan of tiny i loved this movie it was so funny it really captured how spent their 
 this document truly opened my eyes to what people outside of the united states thought about the september attacks this film was put together and presents this disaster as more than an attack on u.s. soil the aftermath of this disaster is from many different countries and i believe that this film should be more widely distributed for this point it also helps in the the process to finally see something other than news reports on the terrorist attacks and 
 within the first N minutes of this movie i knew i was in for one of those pick at the movie the acting was terrible the script was even worse who ever let these people write write such for a movie need to be feed the 's themselves with russian jets as u.s. air force jets and that can shoot N N rapid fire without is poor detail to any story in one scene are killing special forces troops at 
 unless you want to be half to death i 've never been a fan of van and as part of what previous have described as the new youth generation i was very disappointed and slightly angry at the of the characters in the film especially as they were used to string along the film 's ridiculous which is pretty much to the that are social and should be blamed for crimes as a myself i watch a lot of films 
 this is one of the best of the i saw it twice about ago and have not had another opportunity to see it again since then it rivals the series also in exciting 
 i live up here in territory and remember well the true events that inspired this movie our fall out each time we hear of a attack black water is quite simply the best movie i have ever seen while i loved last year for all its effects and scenes it was the local scenes that captured our audience we in more than anything black water however really with the and fear that you can experience when you are alone in 
 how many english N student 's versions of N must america endure this is a great book but kind of a i know i 'll write one just like it where everything works out i 'll also replace 's old used up political from the with my own informed opinions form the think think political insight evil politicians i 'm a and there will be that they make of themselves for some reason i 'll work on that it 'll 
 having read this story a while ago i was very excited to see the movie i read the book again it is one of my favorite nicholas books what i think what makes the story is the relationships that was the down point for me in the movie because i think the relationships were poorly expressed in the movie i have no idea what the point of changing main characters roles tim 's and alan 's characters the movie did 
 it would seem we should acknowledge for more than merely the N movement as up by the all those years ago or the man in english is a and deeply thought through film yet deeply entertaining and rich in content both on and under the surface as a film alone it is a comedy on society and attitudes in the world we live in a world that judging by the man has reached the regions of norway and the like 
 talk about over acting not just by but also by and the direction was awful the first half hour you would pretty much want to switch the movie off because this movie is a real mark my words i liked in some his comedy roles like no N and and this does not compare to any of them and khan should not do comedy roles at all he he does not know how to do comedy the only good comedy 
 the year N saw two very different and interesting ' by henry king and master ' by john ford ' was historically notable as it clearly influenced 's noon ' N and later i personally find master ' superior to it 's contemporary counterpart ford 's minor is n't much about it should be more as a describing of old west although optimistic and warm at heart we are from because it 's completely free from is well used as 
 whatever guy to 's film is new film is a mess there was one other person in the audience when i saw it and she left about an hour into it i hope she demanded a refund the only reason i stayed through to the end was because i 've never walked out of a i sat through this piece of junk that and could actually think they made a good film the dialogue is the acting is and the 
 your attitude going into night ii will determine how much you take away from the film if you 're expecting a look elsewhere if you like movies that are rather fun to watch you 'll like this has the time of her life playing an over the top mary and wendy channels 's rage perfectly during her time classic but a fun way to kill a couple of hours with a ending 
 i love anthony hopkins as an actor so i was very interested to see how he would do as a i could not have been more disappointed by this move the movie was so and the was so over done to the point i wanted to pull the plug out of the wall the actors were very good but it was such a waste of talent not all actors are cut out to be writers or directors and clearly mr. 
 is a i 'm slowly getting into following the efforts of deep red and he 's not a to always care directly about silly things like plot that might be his one minor but for me apparent liability he wo n't let a little thing like common sense up his plan for his elaborate killing as his killer s can go through any kind of elaborate of being until past the point of the tracking shots of said killer but 
 i bought this on as hospital and when i got home i and was like it 's the legendary so here 's another one from al who had clearly learned some amount about since the blood of 's castle days where that earlier effort is a more or less totally this one it up a little adding a element of variety and surprise amid the sure half of the movie is a blind football player shooting the with his but 
 john hughes ' son wrote a high school drama i thought as i the 's here on late on a saturday night having found myself watching the opening credits on 've just finished watching it and it was from there on you ca n't a film this poor but i 'll leave the out of this review there 's an awful lot of style over very little substance unfortunately the style has n't dated too well in the eight years 
 this is one of the greatest i 've ever seen along with dark days i have for maybe an hour my entire life and i still love this movie and his excellent editor captured the feeling and atmosphere perfectly helped in part with some incredible tony is one of the individuals in existence love those high sport you rock tony not only is this movie a but the has to be one of the best in history if you 're 
 usually alan plays characters that are too soft and overly it 's probably how he really lives this time he fits the character though he when the verdict is being N prison and the state of new york 's response is remembered by many of us as a event only a few journalists have told the true story this film provides a quick look at the and excesses associated with the had a major impact on this country maybe the 
 i did not like the and now probably my favorite vietnam war film is the hunter the hunter focused on one part of the war and then focused on the lives before the war this movie is essentially hunter the script is too loose compared to the hunter the story is never developed to the point that the audience can truly understand and feel for the characters like the did the vietnam are not as or involved as the ones 
 this is a typical college comedy and its very average the story is ok but not very entertaining its about a guy named who his job gets his car off and then his uncle dies in a his got a girlfriend though a nice one anyway this uncle gives him his mansion in la and mercedes as heritage and soon and his girlfriend moves to la to this new house the problem is that they would need some in order 
 this movie rocks as ever and polly were we really ever that young this movie can still touch the hearts of a lot of it needs to be put on soon or it will become a classic i really enjoyed growing up to this movie i have always had a crush on now i am too old but to this movie is made for all > you know i come from the early N s area were i had to 
 after attack of the foot woman with opened the doors for women to be just as dangerous as men there was obviously an open market for other movies to pick up and carry the and what more a lovely actress than from it 's a mad mad mad mad world to play the role the is that and may just be too sweet and innocent looking to step into ' size N shoes this role really needed someone with an 
 this focuses on the in in swedish media the demonstrators where as criminals that stood for and violence this movie shows that there not actually they are people that has something to say and says it by the force of bricks they believe in a better world a world where people can think and say what they want without being aimed at but are their of having the possibility of changing the society realistic i think gives us in the 
 several have quoted his desire to make a film showing smiling to camera the short answer is would n't we all the harsh reality is that only a select few got to do so at this stage of her career could n't get arrested in N she left hollywood to make a picture in europe fell for director and never looked forward after five in italy she was probably ready to open a but within the year after making this 
 in texas seven friends meet in a bar to the halloween night before going to a party meanwhile they call the american nightmare radio for fun and their fears a serial killer who is listening to their makes their come true killing each one of them in a way american nightmare is a weird low budget movie that has a horrible beginning without any previous explanation a woman two couples in an isolated area as if it were friday then 
 for those who think it is strictly humor and you are in fact the one while the show does contain its share of jokes it also contains a lot of material and fun at social problems racial barriers 's etc you just need to read into some of her material a bit more to get i also love is that not everything is a for those expecting a joke like friends i love friends you wo n't find it here 
 the film is set in on in north east england the town where i was born and grew up the film is also fundamentally the way it presents the town the kids but above all the men of the town in this film they are all stupid violent i could comment on the plot predictable the performances the direction and but to me that is all irrelevant compared to the director 's to the town and its the invitation in 
 this film was the worst film i have ever seen it was a complete waste of money if i had not been in the was my two young who also thought it was disappointing but not as terrible as i thought i would have left the there were two points in the film that i almost but the rest of it was either boring ridiculous or painful i thought it would be a on all movies which i love but 
 i loved the idea of this film from the moment i first saw a for it has always been one of my heroes and the image of him as the slightly mad was enough to get me to see the film the added of as made it even story is pure fantasy but a one an auto falls in love with a beautiful woman who happens to be 's with the help of four of physics ed on a to 
 this movie is simply was a very sensitive issue and movie was movie did not create any controversy in india as far as i know and its publicity was also kept i thought that this movie would simply be a waste of time since most of the indian directors and producers used to change the theme even though its very sensitive and adds a love story in original story and the whole thing most of the indian viewers would agree 
 a very interesting entertainment with the of the old movies faces the greatest without if the moment requires it and we all enjoy with him his most for me is a man without special powers facing the problems and beating them just with human skills he was a great and had a great 
 this is a good movie something fun about watching money be at a rate especially from a kid 's point of view take it for what it is a fun little movie about a kid 's dream coming true and what a kid might do with $ N million dollars do n't like it do n't watch it they make movies for the watchers not the people that have nothing better to do then complain in their lives 
 you do n't have to be a football fan to enjoy this because i am not but as a football fan in general this was fun to watch it almost makes me a fighting irish if you ca n't get caught up in the in this film fan or not you better check your because this is an emotional film with some very a sports fan i loved watching the classic of early college games they had some pretty wild 
 god i am so sick of the that comes out of america called since became popular the usa either produce a with a style of drawing or some japanese usually up classic characters no wonder is beating american they are not even trying anymore oh i just heard of this last night i live in the and when i found out this show first came out in N well i never knew the was so with current shows 
 was a card playing he was quoted in an interview as saying some day i it 's possible for someone to be a better no limit player than me i doubt it but it could happen but i to you i do n't see how anyone could ever play gin better than me there 's a gin scene in this movie that is so amazing you could have it in ' ' as a for a 's power that 's 
 i enjoyed from the hopes and dreams and of each of the characters is and we the audience get to know each and every one of them and all and the ending was a great wonderful and surprise thanks for the experience i 'll be looking forward to more 
 i went to a of this movie and while it had a couple moments that made me it had some very major flaws it first of all presents itself to be the of a trying to find love in la what it into is a and through the history of the film director 's love life and professional life jokes wear thin quickly and you find yourself suddenly not how this man 's dates progress the is that the director 
 i 've read a few books about and and this is definitely more accurate than the version in that its and echo actual photographs taken of the gang particularly well done is the death of buck and the capture of his wife this actress looks looks exactly like the photographs taken that day of over her dying husband however this movie is still hollywood and our stay pretty to the end even after being shot full of in life was 
 my personal opinion is that this movie had no real story line to the first john carpenter 's but i do n't care i loved it jon was great in this movie he really mad me believe that he was the person you would never think he was a famous there were some bad things about this movie like the story line there should have been more to the should have been a to the movie that followed the movies 
 having just watched this movie i almost feel like having wasted N hours of my life but i guess there is some good in everything if i was to rate this as any other movie it can only receive N or N tops but if i grade it like a low budget movie it may get N or that is a movie is supposed to be ' and without too long of or waste of time this movie is n't 
 its about time that is released on i can not accurately say how many times i have watched this fine film but i never tire of it the lead actors worked so well together victor grant and douglas jr are an just can not get over their in india your first at the three is when you see them engaged in fighting with other soldiers over a so-called the three are sent on an to find out what happened to 
 this so called is terrible i went to see this tonight on the first day as the anticipation and was too much for me to handle but within the first half an hour we knew that this is a disaster it not only does not match the created but also the original blockbuster the script had the was quite a few times who is an excellent actor did an job was the director wanted to how evil his character is 
 i first saw this when i was a in my last year of junior high i was to it i loved the special effects the places and the and method of telling the years later i read the book and while it was interesting and i could definitely see what swift was trying to say i think that while it 's not as perfect as the book for social commentary as a story the movie is better it makes more 
 where the sidewalk ends N where one ends another is a film and as such pretty from both style and content points of view the photography and night are first rate joseph lets the drama in scene after scene and the on faces pure i can watch this kind of film for the alone even when the actors struggle and the plot but the acting is first rate here and the plot features what i consider the core of most 
 i never had an while watching the movie that it was meant for the box i always thought that this was some very good successful movie of the late N 's but after i saw on the that this was meant for the tv i was shocked because for a television film it is absolutely the thing that mostly concerned me was the length i felt that the one on one battle scene should 've been removed as it was 
 story of a man who has feelings for a starts out with a opening scene that is a example of absurd comedy a formal audience is turned into an violent by the crazy of it 's unfortunately it stays absurd the whole time with no general eventually making it just too off putting even those from the era should be turned off the dialogue would make shakespeare seem easy to a third on a technical level it 's better than 
 same old same old about it completely ignored the really interesting facts of 's true character the same boring of the silly tale of an who was so shocked by poverty he became a robin fighting alongside the poor until eventually he was murdered by the cia heard it all before boring and the reality of is very different and far more explosive the facts show that he was a with a messiah streak who openly wanted to impose on 
 if this movie was written directed and produced with the intention of creating a bad movie classic it might i say might have been a hit have you ever sat and watched a movie that was so absolutely awful that it becomes in terms of its well this is it every one of the acting cast should be for worst acting performance it would be hard to find another film with this kind of production budget that contains so little 
 nightmare weekend is proof positive that some people are so desperate to be the movies ' they are prepared to do almost 'm not referring to the women who seem quite happy to appear completely in this piece of trash after all the naked female form is a beautiful thing and nothing to be of no i 'm talking about those who are more than willing to with a badly made called george now that is embarrassing a being created 
 producers and should have been to release this piece of trash publicly i know this is sound but compared to this the first of N looks like a mature and exciting this is cheap phony and badly acted a landmark in bad and one of the few few movies i 've seen that really deserve the lowest possible rating no stars 
 in this film there is a loose plot of a man who wishes to obtain financing for his construction business and a woman he does not love the maria de in the process he maintains his relationship with his first and true love and ultimately gets in his own romantic he never gives up his act until the three main characters come face to face the film results boring with lots of free sex well both are really good all 
 i am a fifth grade language arts teacher and after we read this book which the students loved then we watched the movie they out loud unfortunately it 's not a comedy the acting was so awful i felt like i was watching a bunch of kids in the neighborhood putting on a play my students were the lines and making fun off and on the whole way through i have to agree with them at times it was pretty 
 i went to school with that is how i heard of this movie i do n't really know if it was in the theater 's at all i do n't recall the name i have seen it it is like one of those after school the acting is ok not great the plot was kind of weak and the lines were pretty so the only comment i can give this movie is i borrowed the movie from if i was 
 in director eric 's ' three men are to at the the hands of a woman that they have all abused the first victim is forced to eat his own before being to death the next ends up with a bullet in the after refusing to have sex with the first guy 's but it 's the third man who gets it the worst he has to watch the heavily ' get naked and with a handle oh he also 
 this is not the typical brooks film it was much less than most of his movies and actually had a plot that was leslie ann warren made the movie she is such a actress there were some moments that could have been out a bit more and some scenes that could probably have been cut to make the room to do so but all in all this is worth the price to rent and see it the acting was good 
 chips is an excellent of music light comedy and drama with a picture perfect performance by peter ' and and romantic supporting performance by clark ' is able to show the shy teacher that wishes so much to be loved by his students and is only able to express his love when he married clark she brings him the world what a lot of flowers and he is forever changed he becomes the of through tragedy but knows he could 
 this is the very la of the best films of the new wave and i say one of the first ten ever made why the atmosphere the story the actors actress are all brilliant this is the theater a tale the life the you 
 it is seriously the best show in the world it rocks harder then and and is so funny and entertaining i love the show all N seasons are but for a quick summary season N great if you plan a hunt watch the house be pulled apart and enjoy seeing phil N great if you see them buy castle watch a concert see the wonder that is and the fun of getting to it see a and actually see a 
 first i am a ok and i have to say this movie was pretty good i think any kid ten and under will like it but people my age an up might be a little a well we 'd describe the movie as but i liked it it may be that i still act like a kid or i visit a cattle farm every weekend but this movie was i did like how the actors were like kids not little 
 this movie is total i love and was very surprised earlier this year by a good movie the entire box is misleading while being billed as one of the main people in this film is in the movie for about N minutes even the summary on the back of the is not entirely true this could have been a good movie but the direction was horrible and the plot was about as thin as a sheet of paper usually when 
 the reasons to watch this knock off to a great movie called it 's on while your channel and there 's nothing else on someone pays you to watch yourself a favor and pop in the for rent it it on or put it in your and the entirely the the same story with with a few changes furthermore the just of and actually ends up taking you out of the story several times the worst one is probably the 
 i was completely with this film for no apparent reason every thing just becomes so serious and people are with really then there is a serial killer who apparently can kill one person to get the title of serial killer well the serial killer likes and is illustrated by sound effects you might hear in the dream of most modern films why oh why i no idea it really really wants to be scary but i think in this universe 
 francis ford 's now is not a vietnam war film do not it with one it is set to the back drop of the war but it is a on the deteriorating effects that war has on the human it is also one of the most films ever made produced or even second to the lord of the to call it a would be an of as ambitious as the film 's production with no credits and following a first 
 what impressed me the most about one true thing was how it was when the daughter her mother 's cancer at the beginning of the movie as the subject matter was it was a change of pace instead of being with the about a character 's fatal illness into the movie love story terms of etc. and william hurt give very strong performances that do n't go over the edge the characters they play seem human they 're not perfect 
 i am not a fan of the chan films the plot involving theft from a bank vault is a bit far and a long way from the atmospheric that fox produced and benson as no N son provide some as usual but otherwise there is n't much here great title that is wasted 
 i drove from sacramento to san francisco and back to see this movie premiere and really glad i did as a big movie fan and a northern i was surprised how many films have been made in the bay area as a fashion designer who really wants to stay in the bay area as opposed to going to la george ' comments about community and having a vision really with me if he and all the other can make it 
 should not be considered as en because the sex scenes are not for pleasure unlike movies like behavior or friend of the family is not an easy watch as it 's story is difficult to and it 's not that common in society from the beginning of the movie with the first scene you expect more strong scenes the scene was n't in my opinion a well created scene i think that the director did n't use proper camera techniques 
 guns buildings cars and that 's just the first ten minutes this film involving a who ca n't seem to die no matter how many times he 's shot hence the title is pretty decent tough and gary usually cast as a in these has his usual crazy but is a bit more subdued after all he 's carrying the entire show which does n't mean there is n't a lot of supporting roles including william smith mills watson armstrong 
 probably the best comedy in a long time keeps you laughing the acting is good and there are a lot of such as ben as the store guy the plot was n't as good as i had hoped but the comedy makes up for that i can only hope for a cause it seems like they can still do so much more even though it was N hour and N minutes long i still wanted more at the end also 
 not on the same level as ring or ring N but still a good japanese nonetheless i wish north american producers would take a page out of the japanese and put more ' and less cheap shocks in their lots of good examples in this one scenes where a out face is scene behind a young actress photographs on a wall are suddenly smiling just for a second and more worth checking out if you like the 
 now i recently had the pleasure to watch the comedy party one of my new favorite until it just hurt type of movies so i naturally wanted to see the hoping it would have the same but instead party N the last temptation is made by the american pie generation where it 's and the hole purpose of the first film the first film has but it does n't show in every single scene also the plot is exactly the 
 i ca n't believe i even tried to watch this as an movie fan i was more than at the prospect of this film by popular budget gordon lewis unfortunately right from the opening of the film i could not for the life of me think of a worse movie than this well maybe but i firmly believe dr. the body shop is worse when i think about it a horrible plot that moves slow the movie on with no 
 the series is an always will be the best movies ever there is something about them that makes them special i think it s the feeling you get when you watch them are set in modern times and yet they feel as if they are set in the N s or N s i think it has some thing to do with the set s that are used if so then it s working keep it up guy s a 
 and generally speaking you will eventually have to research this little when describing i changed my sex or or as it is better known i must echo the thoughts of andrew smith who so hit the on the head when he wrote if you have n't seen any of ed wood 's other movies this one is a completely experience if you have seen any of ed wood 's movies this is still completely the film is both and yet 
 i caught this as part of the package at the clinton street theater in and it was simply brilliant the saving grace of what was an other to just plain bad of perfect use of deep black and pure white with excellent yet simple this is simply a story of a cat chasing the moon funny and a small piece of for cat and any one else who how beautiful can be if it 's in your town see it 
 that moment in life that point between the beautiful of and the confusing that marks this is what this movie is all about played by is right at that moment in life when the movie starts she over playing his records and thinking about love her sister will soon be off to college has no trouble with attracting boys is beautiful and seems to have it all figured out although she does n't she dates a local loser father is 
 i did n't know that someone would make this movie its awful i have written down N things that can tell why u do not want to see this N its the biggest ever where is the that i could only see a few people around when they are on the they can only see blood everywhere no people two and one stage and what do they do they drink worst actors i have ever seen the and his crew 
 and totally film the characters does n't interest at all and most of the time is spent in a car the dog is at best never really scary to interest a more threatening would have been needed at least a few people you care for and some in you and not the least something interesting must happen something unexpected as it is this film just on and on in what seems like forever maybe a was not that smart to 
 a critical and financial when first release the critics have turned around and stated that this film of the director 's best a la like feel to the film quickly develops as the guys from a agency ben john and fall in and out of love with some of the most and beautiful women seen on film camp and much of the script was or on the day of shooting which gives the film a feel ben is excellent as 
 first of all i was expecting heat to be along the same lines as the boy was i wrong in no way is this film in chains or women in prison sure the plot consists of a bunch of women in prison who wear street clothes quite but nothing are n't strong no one tries to the or doctor in order to try and escape and no make out there are N scenes that i suspect is just recycled but 
 this is such a and studied film a classic among 's many it takes no to want to watch it again yet you think can it hold up even when the huge and and amazing of the plot is no surprise for there is the start a beautiful and telling of the really the whole story the of it two two men shown with their shoes each walking onto the train sitting then across from each other and a mistake 
 this is truly one of the worst movies ever made and i do n't mean in a kind of way eddie murphy is a great comic and it is a to how bad this movie is that it nearly killed his career the writing and direction are the sets and staging about as as a brady bunch episode and the acting shows just how bad a great cast can be when they have absolutely nothing to work with if it 
 a few of my fellow writers have covered this movie 's plot elements so i will stick to some of the remarks this is entertaining but not for the reasons you 'd think it 's but somehow still daniel 's love interest has to be about the christian girl that dan is way his from mr. also if my guardian looks like i 'm going to have to apply for a so apparently dan is responsible for his parents ' 
 as far as i am concerned this film had two totally different things going for it as opposed to the film i am used to N the setting is paris france N there is scene with no make this movie a bit unique at least to film fans actually an american shot the film so it 's not entirely a european film initially i was disappointed in this after i had watched the first N minutes it 's an expensive 
 i completely that i 'd seen this within a couple of days which is pretty in itself the version of of the opera ' 's mystery i had heard that it was an engaging and update so it appeared from the title and a few neat in the opening scene but the film very quickly ground to a halt and became and wholly a mystery the major problem is that it is fundamentally by the audience like the worst christies 
 ok so is a but the rest of the N hours were wasted wasted oh the poor had to follow his master up the very same hills of new zealand that wait it be someone in the production crew of lord of the was making home movies in his spare time yes that 's it i wish i could at least say he was special effects were often was a 
 there have been many well more than a few in any case attempts over the past N years to create film that has an appearance that this is a film director 's wish to distance himself from other movies or simply to over the and look is on the top of this from the 's process of artificially his film changes it 's structure completely imagine what this film would have looked like in standard it can almost be as 
 one of the best movies i ever saw a classic movie for many years i have been trying to get it on or to no the german industry still prefers to let valuable cultural contributions and this is after all away and collect dust in some rather than distribute it and make a lot of money with it if that is what them instead of the promotion of creative thinking though the once told me if i paid to check 
 is a stunning film and i do n't think anyone is going to be able to argue that but unfortunately the story somewhat falls film nevertheless is very entertaining it uses it 's wild style to tell a somewhat story the film almost works just based on it 's characters and style but in my opinion leaves something to be 
 the only reason i watched this movie is because allen is in it since i admit to watching days of our lives i know her as oh sure perhaps there will be a reason to watch this movie that would be the soft area they seem to at that and little else i would hope anyone this movie it only for the sex scene 's because if they it for anything else say quality tv they may die of a 
 i have to admit that i liked this film much more than i expected to will smith has that that you just ca n't help but like the plot was a minor twist on basic romantic comedy stuff somewhat of 's this guy kevin james has a real for comic timing and physical comedy i have never seen his tv show but he was cast very well in this film was good enough i ca n't remember why she was 
 this to the above and the final entry in the series is slightly more on the whole but it 's also more hell we even get a peter is easily the least of the various egyptian high we 've seen during the course of these films and martin as his seems in the proceedings kurt then is with a ridiculous as the man who the newly the latter in the form of virginia later a character actress gets her most 
 tv pilots do n't you love them martin tried this one out after being successful in a bunch of other tv movies but this one goes nowhere except in the of where it belongs roy is diamond head who takes orders from mary to find spy i mean tree and are there for ethnic comic relief and not much else tree as a bad guy despite all his that makes him look exactly the same as he normally does there 
 one year after ' made its debut it followed the route taken by the buses ' and & son ' by onto the big screen in a picture made by films it opens with a speech the of england 's green and land then cuts to a shot of eddie and bill walking up a street arguing this into a strange of white and black their each other 's homes at least the original theme tune is retained even if 
 after reading the terrible reviews of this movie including comments said to be quoted from i almost did n't bother to add this film to my film collection however being the fan which i am got the better of me to my surprise i enjoyed the movie it had drama and and scene 's the plot kept me right until the end credits and i felt that once one got past rubens opening scene 's that the actress played her 
 i saw this movie when i was really little it is by far one of the movies i have ever seen now normally i like weird movies but this was just a bit too 's not much of a plot to the movie if anything it starts out like toy story where toys come to life and ann and andy go on an to rescue their new friend from there there 's the greedy the a sea monster named and 
 i saw this movie with very low expectations i did n't know a lot about it so i was n't sure if it was going to be worth story did an ok job of getting you about these they travel to the continues when the show up and force them to stay at the the movie turns from somewhat to the amount of found in this movie did not balance out compared to whether it was truly necessary or used 
 through i really am in the minority on this one but i liked this movie it 's not a classic but it 's definitely involving and quite an fueled ride i definitely thought it was worth at least a N the reason i liked it is because i have n't seen the tells me that with a movie like this it 's strongest fans will be the people who have not seen the original version and thus have little to 
 apart from the low budget there never seems to be more than N germans in one scene at any one time plus the same N half tracks this film is top class everything is accurate that is the point i think from the to to the and the is as grey as the field grey grey men with the life out of them forget us made like down and private this is one of the best war films ever only 
 let me break it down for you guys it 's horrible if roger did such a fancy job on the first intentions then why did he do such a bad job on this i 'm sorry but this movie is stupid true it may have improved if its series was ever aired but lets be realistic this movie a a lot of bad acting note the scene what kind of line is that when can we say this movie had 
 the germans all stand out in the open and get down with a machine gun the good guys never die unless its for dramatic purposes the plot has so many its where did the german soldiers go once they rolled the fuel tank the train please and the whole idea a train how is that the germans know where you are going to go its not like you can leave the track and drive away what a waste i would 
 i hoped to learn something from this movie but i was disappointed it is all about and him as a great general but at no time in this entire movie did we ever get an idea of why he was great what made him so successful was it his drive his to accept defeat his discipline with his men i was looking for a that really gets into the character but this fell way flat most of the is and 
 why do i give this N movie N points because i watched it and i found it aliens their weird their weird my god was that a sight and all what these desperate women need is from the where do they look for it in upper germany and that is where the main fun comes from in europe and more so in countries is seen as a traditional and region and then the actors are so with the women well 
 you would probably get something like this i 'm movies for a living and this is the first movie in my working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence of course there are stupid hollywood movies about on a spring break but those movies do n't even claim to be serious works of art but when someone for and but a and often ridiculous story a bunch of scenes dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie

 if you love films and you have n't seen this movie you are cheating yourself this movie is one of the only that could be recommended for fans of all types of film normally it takes a fan of the to see anything in these films but this one has it all the story is well told and complete the fight scenes are great and tend to end before you 're completely with them unlike tiger throw in a little 
 i was looking through the movie listings in my area on and seen a movie that had not been advertised i looked closer and noticed that peter and paul were in it having watched mad about you once i was not a fan of paul however i am a big fan of peter so the spouse and i took a chance we were both into this story the beautiful the acting and the sense of family and moral values that 
 it must say something about the state of our nation that this is one of the most popular currently the ' is by such a group of characters as can be everyone is someone in the back everyone is attempting to commit everyone is trying to someone that or they are being or nobody is nobody nobody has a of luck or a really nice day it 's hell with suspect this must be sponsored by the it 's perfect 
 when alfred made on a train it was a for the bulk of the film going public that he was back at the top of his form from N to N his films were not box office successes and his arrangement with david o. ended because of this actually he made some really good films in the period such as notorious under and my opinion but while notorious and were liked the audiences were turned off by 's attempts at 
 a tale of murder and capital punishment by the state so painfully slow and accurate in the of capital punishment from the preparation of the to the victim in his own before dying it has the power to change your mind about death penalty the whole from this story the was the lawyer unsuccessfully trying to defend and then the accused 
 i love the but it 's value is only for certain parts the opening scene of course some characters are a bit but they are entertaining none the less i think the was pushing it i know it was to show that and were living out in la and to show why quit the i just think that the 's story could have been better also the guy on the phone is and entertaining but once again i think the 
 is it really possible that so many people in this film believe that the girl is a just because she has dark hair and wears dark make up she is supposed to be a and i got the impression that the film tries to present her as someone who is different someone nobody understands she is just a and some girl in her high school says she is a and everyone believes her besides is either portrayed very badly or 
 movie very good photography of which seems now to be a different world and an excellent and production james mason a real first class star it is and i would agree with the above comment that this movie is a national 
 first it takes a full half hour to get out of jail and to start doing the job what a waste of time we all know is getting out to do some job for his masters why waste almost a third of the movie on these then stays in a hotel and the story again goes nowhere simply proving to us that is under close watch and anything he says or does is know by the masters again another N 
 i 'm probably not giving this movie a fair shake as i was unable to watch all of it perhaps if i 'd seen it in a theater in its original presentation i might have it but it 's far too for read the book some N years ago and the details of the plot have faded from memory this did not help the film as it 's something less than vivid and clear in its presentation of is really 
 just reading why this show got canceled makes me rather this was a favorite of mine as a kid and i always watched it when it came on no matter how many times i saw the episode sure the effects were not great but they were also not horrible either they did a fairly good job with the and it had the nice N 's to it that is always to see and hear as the music was also very 
 very funny attention to detail a real window into a specific time and place in history could almost believe this was a true story in a parallel universe interesting how to anticipates the berlin a N 
 the three names that mean the most to this film are burt reynolds mark and moore these three deliver the strongest performances but the entire cast does a wonderful job the film although about the industry does not let itself get out of hand with it 's own sexual on the other hand there were many scenes that involved drug use and although important to understanding the characters i think there was some in this department paul thomas anderson has 
 i saw two hands back in sydney a few years ago and it instantly became one of my films it 's got action comedy and all rolled up into one and a bit of thrown in for good measure like much australian film the plot is easy to follow yet engaging and jordan should feel proud of his it was on tv just now on channel N in london and my two comedy scenes of not just this movie but 
 between sweeping extraordinary scenes within a of indian locations and a plot which is inspired yet in reality this highly moving film is a for those who love a good and by this i mean good not a hollywood or easy and happy ending east meets west in a different take on the buddy film the performances are inspired and brilliant the and the plot entertaining engaging and without a of or cheap at is a sweet film that wo 
 i 've read every book to date in the left behind series and the movie hardly does any of them justice sure i 've seen worse movies but this was disappointing this movie would have made a good episode the script was a horrible of the book and it felt like the actors were reading their lines instead of actually saying them the characters were stiff and the effects were and looked fake the ending was awful first of all 
 why take a perfectly good original drama based on a perfectly good novel and it as a and cast it with actors exclusively lacking in or talent somewhat to or the two most recent star wars films lost horizon is full of who can forget sir john smiling in his outfit overseeing an dance to the republican party family or to george kennedy doing her best impression as she from one rock to another every little thing you do and 
 technically a van fan or i was this movie is so bad that i myself for those N minutes do not let the name ii fool you i had big hopes for this one depending on what i saw in ii man was i wrong all action fans wanted a big comeback for the classic action hero but i guess we be able to see that soon as our hero keep coming with those going home movies i mean for 
 i have always been a fan of this largely of the opera since i last saw it in as many of you know it has been unavailable on video or in fact the family sought to destroy all existing for some reason hopefully an end to its opposition the family recently approved the showing of a 's print at the museum of the moving image in the print was excellent not perfect but excellent the sound was outstanding in quality 
 this is one of my movies ever i have seen it about a million times and would never turn down the opportunity to watch it again in fact i love it so much that i really wanted to check out the resort where it was on my vacation does anyone know the name of it if so please me i watched this movie for the first time when it was first released and i was about 's age and for 
 given the nature and of the N it is not surprising that this film is at best neutral in its stance america probably the most ' segment comes from ken who is definitely not the british new party line although those events of a year ago are and painful to most americans and most who saw them live through etc the majority of the writers and directors choose to show that tragedy is not an american monopoly should anybody be 
 someone will have to explain to me why every film that features poor people and a look is somehow seen as realistic by some did n't see anything realistic about the characters although the actors did their best with really bad parts or the situations instead i saw a forced effort at being and down and it takes a lot more than the camera without or reason and failing to light the film to achieve any of the above in 
 when i think i think of feel good musical dance numbers with on the men and women and mystery and do n't come to mind though and this to my western eyes is like an comedy i think it would have been a better movie shorter even if the writer and the director had made a choice either gone for outright or instead of an of them all i 'll have to say more than once i thought the director 
 it is a great movie i that some people think that this might not be based on a true story no matter this the movie is great and all u can think is not why a balloon with a on it ends up flying in the town and so on instead thinking that a little girl 's wish came true and this means that all our peaceful dreams will come true if we trust in us and do all in 
 while i can understand some of the points made regarding the i thought a more approach would have better supported the home movie feel i must say that i thought the script and acting of what alice found were excellent dean bell has a real that with her performance of is a pleasure as and romantic we are at once and by her actions and never given more information than is necessary her 's and the supporting cast 's efforts 
 i do n't know why people always want deeper meaning in movies or else consider them about just being something at which morgan freeman he gets a chance to show off a bit his gets a career boost and gets a name to draw people into watching his thought it was a good movie some humor some some but nothing over the top i got an kick out of jim as the at a construction company when he looks at 
 i like all of the main actors involved in this quite bizarre film guy pearce & hugo have all proved themselves as some of the best & most capable actors around but i could not get into this i do n't know if it 's because i do n't understand the or what but i could not get my head around this film worse than anything is that the actors made some of the drag i 've ever seen i 
 ok where do i start i saw a a couple weeks ago and i was shocked how bad this movie is sure if you just love beverly and green acres bad acting and you think they are the best tv shows on air then you will definitely love this movie me personally i really like george 's work and he is very but comedy is not his some people are natural in comedy and i am sure he is great 
 the topic is a straight quote from the movie and i think it 's pretty accurate i was so to dead with this effort all the etc making no sense after first N minutes is just bad film making if you are you would have died at least five times already of course all the david lynch fans would raise a flag for this kind of turkey to be the best film ever made because it does n't make any 
 at first a film like a town set to be flooded in N and a group of N characters who are sent out to the remaining could be just an ordinary film as we soon meet a remaining taking care of a sick child a greedy land owner we could be set up for a simple story we could all easily digest however when one is first introduced to this film you notice the amazing wide open and a scene 
 this is the version that even the author because it 's so they gave it a ending ' and changed a lot of the dialogue and it 's just a big pile of the manager ' is quite good i believe he the role but everyone else falls into that acting style of the N 's that is really just the one great the music this has one of the best scores ever recorded and it 's worth seeking out 
 ok i was bought this a few ' ago by my brother in law who took me to see get in the which the both of use were impressed with and watched both get and be cool one after another i have read reviews of people that had not seen get and thought this film was quite good i just think its another way for film companies to the paying customer all i have to say about this film is 
 whoever made this movie must have done it as a joke i mean this was the movie i think i have ever seen a killer a small town give me a break love it when he takes off driving the car more like a comedy than a movie if you want a rent this if you truly want a movie stay the hell away from this one 
 the guidelines state that a comment must contain a minimum of four lines that is the only reason i am saying anything more about because after all my one line summary really says everything there is to say there is absolutely nothing entertaining in this film 
 this is the kind of movie that makes you wonder who 's idea this was and what soup kitchen are they eating at now to say this was bad is an to the bad movies we all know and i saw 's name in the tv guide i figured it would be a maybe it should have been could have made for a better for the scene where they are in an in flight with the door open and there 
 i 'm sure the film contains certain in logic but i was so by it that i really did n't care the movie plays out like a fun combined with a action it 's packed with action packed with excitement and has some moments as well is fun to watch and i have n't seen louis jr. since i saw in theaters he is a fine actor and i love watching him on screen i just wonder what he 's 
 the of lord of the is based on the classic book of the by edgar rice and is a more to the classic book the film has some great like the of south africa to the mansion the acting is also great lambert did a great performance as it was also his first english speaking role the film has some funny moments sad moments and moments that makes this a real film sees a boat in the of south africa 
 this is one of those movies that was never publicized and therefore was missed when it originally played in the came across it while switching tv channels and was immediately in this story of an aging whose and lack of responsibility hurt everyone around him i 've often wanted to see the movie again but could n't even remember its name and have never seen it in the rental and slim pickens were excellent in their roles and the was 
 for reasons i can not begin to dr. lorenzo george begins wolf 's blood into his glenn strange the result is transformed into a as as someone with a bad and teeth can be killer dr. uses to get his against those in the scientific community who at and his ideas and why would n't they dr. 's than a the mad monster is one and poorly made poverty row there 's really only one positive i can come up 
 although this film looks like a crime the plot is actually a bit and with very few surprise or turns at all and those that do appear are not exactly if you slip out of action ' mode and into entertainment ' then this is really quite a fun movie with several moments most of these can be attributed to the dialogue between alan and thompson 's characters but that said said it all in her opening to and it 
 sure it had some of the of a good film the is good if a bit and the acting was good enough though i did n't understand why had such a australian if her character was supposed to have been raised in the us my biggest problem however was with the i know as rule the average american is considered a by any european but this was beyond that 's were and that potato sad excuse for a she wore 
 an film not made for an irish audience with and each of a half decent the had but one choice force the irish actors to adopt equally bad reducing the whole thing to the lowest common 
 if you find the of violent and police expressed in a plot less film with entertaining then you 're bound to enjoy this film was garbage for both the mind and spirit the notion that this is a is that would some kind of tension and you kept waiting for the story to actually finish starting it never rises above a of violent criminals and individuals from all walks of life picture all of the violence of no country for 
 the box is one of the movies i have ever seen to explain my experience let me use this word picture imagine that you have been on and for the last month while watching nothing but zone reruns the resulting you in a hospital where the seems to get a kick out of shooting into your the dream that you have while in the will be something like this a man shows up at the door of a couple he 
 lets first start this review with the fact that i signed up just to write the review and warn people to save their money this was one of the worst pieces of trash i have seen since the the was the most predictable garbage you could possibly come up with if you are expecting N but on the big screen flush that expectation down the toilet immediately along with the money you would use for a ticket you may get 
 i hired the yesterday and first of all it started bad it 's N N aspect ratio film and it just keeps getting worse the acting is so bad and the movie itself is way to predictable i was like watching the movie and said to myself this going to happen next and guess what happened right if you want to see a good action movie do n't watch this one you 'll end disappointed on this movie like i 
 this is a mess and pretty convincing is very much in command of this movie with his portrayal of the control linda hoffman plays his cheating wife and she is very easy on the eye unfortunately for her the little with the pool guy brings severe punishment in a way the good doctor knows best shame about that pretty the last half hour of the movie is devoted to 's character losing it completely and the falls on a young 
 being the only movie i was able to see at this year 's at this year 's festival will be remembered as a low for movie which was announced as an is nothing more than a sick piece of excuse the language but there are n't any decent words to describe of all the actors are not the best but even better actors would not have the movie the plot after the first N minutes it was quite clear that 
 this and to the successful the of creek is a in name only stories in a fishing community of a supposedly vicious called big bay that deep in the of creek two brothers and their older more sister a performance by future different strokes star go into the marsh to check out if the of local may be in fact a real live being the get lost in a fierce storm and the but very and comes to the kids 
 i found the film quite the way the main character was lost but at the same much more clear about certain things in life than people who him his for example was and you loved to watch him being it had this side which was but we were all happy to see him come out of the again was like a game character or through a or to enemy and we love to watch him under attack or fire but 
 is pretty good movie robert was very good in the movie and was perfect for the part its hard to believe that this is a true story but what can you do when i watched this i thought why do they have to do all of those things it is n't right but they learned their lesson when they picked on the wrong man anyway if you ever see this movie on tv watch it because its a good one 
 a totally attempt at movie about of australian soldiers during the new guinea campaign total waste of money even if you only see it on the video store provided a free weekly hire with the else it would have been a complete waste of money probably made by types and full of the that today 's seem so into frankly this movie is an to the memory of the that never came back somebody please provide the funding to make 
 not totally off the wall in a good way but just totally stupid killer is an uneasy of and supposed comedy what this to is a and totally film there is very little mainly due to the fact that the script if there was one is complete i would n't even call it strange more like just total nonsense this movie is certain to and you have been warned there is absolutely no reason to waste time on this and 
 i think category N day of destruction was very the digital effects where like a children 's the actors did n't act for example when the girl was shot she acted like she got on her the movie was boring but i watched it because it was on the only interesting character was he was funny please keep the special effects liked the comment what did we do to mother nature i do n't know what else to write to 
 does n't even begin to describe saving grace it 's absolutely anyone who ventures into this movie will leave with their spirits soaring high has just lost her husband but her problems are about to get a whole lot worse her has left her with no money and outstanding debts faced with losing everything she has to find out a way to get a lot of cash fast she gets an idea when her craig ferguson asks the to give

 this film is great all the machinery and technology is it is packed with action and not to mention guys you will want to see it again and again very very funny also it has a very unique plot which is you would n't want to miss out on it 
 and was it was a girl version of and but less funny and they used too much background and too much background and music if you ask me it starts out boring and totally does n't pick up pace anywhere soon and i was feeling more frustrated as this nonsense carried the only thing that saved me from giving this movie a N was the last N found it somewhat entertaining and interesting as it the end but that was 
 not exactly a new story line but this romantic comedy makes the concept work a young man john and a drop dead woman kate keep meeting by chance and wonder if they are meant for each other although both are promised to others oddly enough they still feel that their soul is out there somewhere a little in some places but la love being a romantic i am almost obligated to be my favorite scene is where is on the 
 robin williams is excellent in this movie and it is a the material is not enough of a match for him this may work if you buy into the number one mentality but story nothing much happens quite a shame really since the movie is really trying to say something and says it it just does n't pack enough emotional 
 in my honest opinion everyone should see this movie at least once it really put things in perspective as i watched it though it was this movie is about something that could happen to your shows how easily two kids can hide both their for their school and their plans to murder innocent students this film would not have worked in any other format they pulled off the hand-held camera us of april N when eric harris and murdered N 
 i agree with another this is such a film that will be tough to watch again soon though for quality alone it deserves repeated the of the characters the incredible and direction make this movie worth the emotional price of is one scene of the two dragging themselves through the snow to escape a that 's perhaps for sheer the most amazing performance i 've ever seen in fact though not the story flows this is a movie of scenes

 a very straight nice old lady desperate for money to save her house and grows pot in her house it with a few friends and then sells it that 's the story for this comedy the of the situation and some of the humor the brings for much of the film it works the humor is n't of the variety but it does keep you for an half so i guess it serves its are funny moments and is fun 
 i 'll be honest the only reason i watched this one on tv is that it 's in the bottom and right now i 'm wondering if the hour and a half of my life really was worth another ' on that same is who finds himself on a huge fight with the universal soldiers after the main computer pulled a ' to defend itself and yes after all the explosions and he is the last one standing combined with 
 i have seen this film more then once actually el was one of the best feature films that i have seen in a great deal of was a big cast and who really like a real star in this part of heard this film was shot for under two million dollars i have seen films shot for N million that compare to the quality and production why are you not getting offers and more film work excellent job i wait 
 a decent but does not pack the of the original a nelson assumes new in order to direct his own novel by the lake still killing but movie seems very any humor is not of the funny kind total project seems to have the quality of a and at times nelson is way over the top this movie is about a script being before going to the screen this should have happened to this script 
 yet another in the long line of do n't films of the late N 's and early N 's yet this one is much more than that this film is a highly underestimated low budget with a twist it has the quality and bizarre that is typical of films of the time period but it 's the highly underestimated performances of the surprisingly that make this movie good a young at dr.

 of all the films made through the N 's and N 's this is one that has developed a real following with the exception of all the films bruce lee in this is a film that has stood the test of time and its due to the unique story an aging master tells his last about five he has trained in the past all five wore and nobody has seen the face of each other and they have all been

 sophisticated sex are always difficult to pull off look at the films of edwards who is the master of the and you will find just as many misses as hits for if a film of this nature ever fails to work it can never fall back on the tried and true toilet humor of a sex comedy american pie or warm the audience with the of a romantic comedy roberts ' entire career it can only maintain a push to

 there are so many words i want to use to describe this movie but ca n't really do that can i this movie is a movie to watch if you just want to sit cry and then i 'm serious do n't watch this movie if you 're easily by sex and everything else associated with nature being a woman and that might not even be a factor i can watch this movie over and over again parker and stone

 judging from this film and the strong man made the same year i would not place harry at the top of the list of great silent screen there simply is not enough there perhaps he was on his way to developing his style but himself by taking his first big successes too seriously in any event all of his are of the greater funny men but he lacks the skills of and the of lloyd he also his own by

 the only thing that surprises me more than the number of people who liked this movie is that it was directed by whose work i the leads had absolutely no chemistry not for a second could i believe that there was anything deeper than between them the story just did n't ring true add to that conversation tons of and an slow plot that basically leads nowhere and you 've got yourself a real 's scenes might be for those 
 although i had some hopes for this film particularly since i enjoy the acting of & so much i must say it was one of the worst films i 've seen in recent memory loser and and the women are also on that list there were a couple of out loud moments although the movie could have been so much better the was not artists cheating their way through college meet their match when they 're discovered by someone with

 cohen is a and this movie is good although the film does n't nearly reach the quality of the it 's still very funny and has some seriously moments i 've liked since the first time i saw the material from the show i think he 's one of the best comedy characters of all time up there with say peter action and the blues brothers biggest surprise with this film was that they 've actually got some serious actors 
 almost every review of this movie i 'd seen was pretty bad it 's not pretty bad it 's actually pretty good though not great the character could have gotten but she did n't allow it to somewhere along the line i 've become a fan of van at least in the early N 's 's is great but the film missed a great chance by not showing more of their relationship i gave it a N 
 three children born at the same time during a solar begin to murder anybody that killer kid movies were n't exactly new at the time of this N 's the theme of children as works for this film bloody birthday does deliver some good and while managing to be a competent killer with some strange it a fine line between and but it does remain entertaining throughout with an interesting plot there 's some strong murder scenes as well as 
 jack N was a horrible terrible excuse for a to a great movie the original was a low budget comedy film about a murdered who was turned into a after an accident with some toxic waste and the went around people and avoiding blow like the this however was a far cry from the quality of the original it seems like this even had a because for some reason after an hour into this film i still had n't seen 
 i thought that this is a written movie i love little and the this movie is very easy for little kids to understand but a good movie for adults as well i liked this movie because it continues the original lady and the tramp and that movie is a classic lady and the tramp N 's was filled with new characters brilliant and classic characters i have loved the movie ever since i saw it for the first time i 
 grey gardens was and crazy and you just could n't really look away it was so strange and funny and sad and sick and really no words can describe the move grey gardens is beyond bizarre i found out about this film reading my uncle john 's great big reader by the reader 's institute and it was well worth the rental and to the top of my movie watching this movie is about the most people that may have 
 i watched the beginning twice could not make sense of it and it bothered me for the whole work this out with me wayne the good guy on the the drivers the money and takes one driver is then killed and the other by the bad guys thanks to wayne who them and then watched it wayne drops the money in the the girl into town it up with too bad about the dead guy i guess and then later 
 is a dark gloomy but movie and is one of the best ones a bit of but nothing really that bad played a strong role as he the not really like because too but a decent plot and it 's the kind of movie that you would probably like to watch on a dark night at best N 
 it is not surprising that this film was made by i 'm at the time it was he examined the early beauty and tragedy of life in and a well-known korean folk tale in and these his last two films what is most surprising is that his N offering is not presented in the style of those previous two the experienced hand of i 'm comes through we explore together the life of a real person a late century who 
 first of all let me comment that the audience loved it from the first moment perhaps current events in the led people to take the attitude i came for a comedy and by george i 'm going to enjoy it but for whatever reason everybody seemed really into the comedy of it the last few times has tried to do a straight comedy small time of the hollywood ending i 've felt like the felt and a bit i remember 
 first off just to say i did n't get the edition i thought i would i chose the italian version over the but what actually arrived was a release from N claiming to be a special edition i never knew there was a release but the promised were not actually on the just a couple of duff anyway as to the film itself just as i was recovering from night train my second turns up in the same month this

 i think that this film adds to diversity and is very accurate in terms of historic the way it shows the various communities leaving together in thailand is very interesting the the japanese and the various communities being managed by the king the around the court are as usual a struggle for power with a lot of the is fine the film is also done locally in thailand in a reasonable production the scene with the as is very interesting 
 can you say all shock no plot there were so many in this movie there was no history about the room other than the deaths why was it evil what made it that way why an hour then there were the things hinted at for example we saw a camera in the air which he mentioned but when he climbed up said there was no about the fact that all the ghosts looked digital and things out before hitting the 
 this is not the video but only because it came out in N when they were presumably tired of the whole thing in britain it is N a of the and would have been banned for the same reason whatever that was initially confused as i thought that kelly may have been a different but she was someone trouble by of a similar to the one in the first film fans will immediately note that they are not the same 
 in watching this off and on for a few seasons two things come to mind one wondering what kind of girl wants to be a model and two run to the ice store and have a low fat tried to be a fan because i liked the idea of this reality show competition no other famous model thought of this and it is very for banks to do so but as the series goes on and on i 've come 
 this film was in scandal for so long that it became a very sought after item the the mystery etc it had everything to be a great piece of but ultimately fails in every extent it 's a bad comedy a movie a N includes a with interviews on etc as well as an extensive interview with the director for those who have heard about it but never seen it the package will seem until one actually sees the film 
 let me say that i love watching over me i was paying close attention to his he raises his voice i help but think of happy at a golf ball then i back as me over me is a great film a film that comes off slow at first with you expecting in every always does a great job and is no exception here with some truly great lines and is worthy of an in any movie he was amazing 
 although it was dark and at times hard to watch you are alone held my attention and was honest in its it truly captured the of romantic relationships in addition the was amazing the and the tone of the the of the film so well that it made you wonder if the tracks were created specifically for the movie is the best actress i have ever watched her compelling and performance made the movie it made me wonder if she

 i was initially dubious about this movie merely because of the subject but the drawn characters the scenes of the hunt and the dramatic conclusion make it watching i initially had trouble between the two but as the movie they increasingly distinguished themselves i am still by the final scene 
 a boy who is not in the military and has not trained to be a jet pilot takes off for a foreign country to rescue his if this is not ridiculous enough he talks a in the air force into helping him get his hands on a jet to make the picture even more absurd the risks his career and life by giving the some hands on aid they not only do n't make like this anymore but they never 
 some friends recommended this but as a film it 's really lacking in i found the characters to be and the plot is predictable almost from the beginning however if you like traditional it will keep your interest long enough to hear the next one i 've also read that the is nothing like the music in the movie with professional musicians filling in for the actors

 another episode from that as an adult i look back on with a different perspective this was one of my favorite episodes one that really my of this show however on this episode after N years i 'd say it is definitely one of the lighter ones played for and instead of the dramatic and story lines in previous episodes in this their first and best season perhaps this episode was written for a little fan r & r too 
 i admit it now this is one of the films ever made but in defense the not really was n't all bad and you got love the effort of going all the way to sweden just to find a sweet swedish N year old have her speak swedish as the jewish mother of henry dennis what makes this scene so perfect is that father answers the jewish girl in german the best of all in the film must be the 
 let me clarify that this is not a good movie but i am so glad it is out there i am so glad i saw it and for the role that it plays in my collection it is it is the ultimate it is college as we imagine it will be when we 're in high school it requires so much suspension of that it may as well be taking place on it is so that even when it tries

 this early film from future is a very good addition to the set in rural italy there is a serial killer of children at large add to the mix an array of characters familiar to fans of a a newspaper reporter police a a a girl a etc this is one of the best italian of the early for a the victims in this case are young boys which makes a change from the more typical women in the fact 
 yes this is an budget movie so the acting is n't award winning material and at times the action is because the are shooting longer and not a million that then get into a movie this film makes up for that with an outstanding script that takes seriously explains it and develops a full plot out of it aside from the story we get detailed genetics legal and law enforcement arts action and some good metal music go to the 
 my french classes always enjoyed this film very much in a inner-city high school the film provided many subjects for discussion in french in class but i know a lot of discussion went on in english after class the most obvious is the relationship between and compared to the one between and always mentioned that i felt this film had one of the scenes i had ever seen in a movie one year a shouted yes when he figured out 
 this is a great movie when two people from different backgrounds and social status think that they have nothing to offer each other and in the end they what each other needs it a to what the heart knows sometimes we wonder why one man is with a woman or and the appearances say one thing to our eye but what they offer each other from within that we can not see is amazing and when thought that had nothing

 the & of the scale of this movie me about a week ago i posted a commentary on the N silent in hell referring to it as staggering then i encountered the bros. blood red planet it 's all about the scale of the thinking behind it the bros. and john were thinking so big that the of arthur c. clark & stanley 's N a space is lucky it was released years before this as a matter of fact 
 when my parents this movie i was expecting a very funny movie as is very funny in comedy movies however this movie is not all that funny and it is somewhat boring too you can see the surprise coming a mile away and it runs long for a movie that is supposedly only one minutes long so i can say it is not a movie that is on my list it may work for some people but it just did 
 rarely have i felt the need to comment on movies lately but this one especially is for a let 's start at the beginning first susan puts kim in the tired old victim role complete with the husband and suburban existence let it be said right now that almost all content in this movie is completely and 's attempt at involving the christmas tree with no star is she goes out for some christmas paper one dark and night della 
 this movie is great if you enjoy watching movies that is this is a classic college N 's movie in which one song is played throughout the entire a horrible film but worth to make fun of or just to watch old men pop out of with funny if you ask me 
 the first N minutes of this movie were quite boring it focused on the personal problems doyle had including his sick wife death threats by fans a publisher and feelings of concerning his ill father even though these subjects had an important impact on doyle 's life i was more about the birth of holmes the last N minutes were excellent we finally got a look inside doyle head how he created holmes and why he had to ' holmes 
 i 'm not sure if this is some kind of or just by the performances and whatever the case i 'm sure i loved it from the stories to the performances from robert and to the vivid with which it 's all captured this is trash and it 's great fun not to mention the and sexual which the entire film always threatening to escape from the image into the dialogue but never doing so i 'd be lying if

 this really is by far the worst movie i 've ever seen in my whole life i 'm approaching N the on the back of the cover the text right at the begin of the movie the further plot was and even a bunch of would have shown more life in their acting i viewed the full length of it and was really relieved when the final character 's death the end of my suffering the location was either some 
 the odd couple is one of those movies that far its reputation people all know it they the theme song they complain of living with a sloppy or a but they 're the film without knowing it this is n't just about a neat guy living with a sloppy guy it 's a portrait of two friends helping each other through the of it 's also damn funny from start to finish but it 's the kind of comedy that 
 i have now suffered through parts the have the word in the title of this movie is an to real story was about a owned by the the man they grow for from the later on for the original humans in need of transplants one the government gets angry and all involved but the story somehow leaks out is truly how a movie with potential is destroyed by such as the only thing he succeeded in doing was to in 
 john 's career as a film director was extraordinary we had watched this film when it first came out but wanted to see it again when it showed on cable recently the film has a faded look as one watches it today but still it is interesting because of the intense performances of the two you have n't seen it please do n't read any and were two friends that came from upper middle class backgrounds chris went to enter

 i quit watching the west after quit writing and producing it just was n't the same imagine my at seeing a film that he wrote again it has been a long time the american president a few good men his script was a beautiful of humor and tragedy he made a compelling story and made me at the same was incredible as a texas congressman whose constituents only wanted lower taxes and to keep their guns not a hard job 
 this movie made by the was made in honor of the montreal years in the N 's N 's and N 's my grade teacher played this in class in honor of my birthday in N and also to my return from a serious injury in i have been a fan for N of my N years of life on a scale of i give this film a all fans should see this as i hope it will be placed 
 this is by far the worst film i have seen in my entire life the acting is poor and the is almost whether or not you like or any ships for that matter is irrelevant as for special effects the film has none the whole film crew were probably on the boat out in rough rather than in a studio and when some of the men are if you can even call it that their reactions are totally the guns 
 i can only agree with many observers that is one of the most ever made for television i saw when it was on tv and i have just watched it again i am particularly moved by the original music of tim and especially by the of 's chamber in c minor the music over the credits and in parts of the film the music the of the characters as they pursue their sad fate the music is emotional this arrangement 
 this light comedy should be enjoyed for entertainment value it gets quite funny at times but if you have n't spent any time on ' side of the tracks you will miss the comedy when it cast of characters well together and are quite in their roles how grace handles meeting her dead girlfriend was well played she 's a true lady and my favorite is grace 's white suit that she highly recommend this to anyone who wants to 
 garden state was a film at best the film seems more like a of thoughts that the writer had rather than a story the plot may have been more engaging if it were n't with scenes that were nothing more than these scenes are often the ones that are in conversation walking past that turn on as he passes crazy party scene shouting over a the list goes on main character is flat and ultimately which is most in the 
 it 's a few years later 's classic network will be his true big home run but for now this dark comedy is n't the classic it to be it 's mostly awful although it has some good scenes the first murder victim being found the clerk responsible for billing patients making a surprise discovery 's and the very last scene where scott 's character his professional integrity and it also has some scenes scott 's character 's during his 
 this was one of the best movies i have seen the movie to real life and how drugs can play a major part although this movie appears to be produced from a low budget i found it to be to may not like the story and say the script is lacking direction however when a person gets as deep into drugs as these characters there is no direction is life i feel this movie is an accurate representation of what 
 i 've now just that by watching this film i have lost valuable precious moments of my life i will never get back film is n't just poor its dire it reminded me of every black ever regret watching this its a race issue apparently white people do n't like it because it does n't have white actors i think you 'll find the reason why no one liked this was because watching dry is far more entertaining and then 
 in this little film we have some great characters but a very plot it is actually nice to watch because does a great job at the conflicts and the relationships this makes the forget the that this movie supposedly is for in fact what we have here is all the possible and put on in a rate higher than that of a soap definitely not a deep movie even if it wants to be but better than an average college 
 now and again a film comes around by accident that makes you doubt your we just finished studying the novel at school and decided to our memory of this piece of garbage with the funny thing about is that it actually makes you want to kill yourself the film is nothing like the book for example the evil characters seem to have been turned into john looks like a on acid while plays the role of the main character is 
 i bought this film from as part of a lot of about all about a dollar a piece when watching this my first impression was that it probably was from the late later on i began thinking the park on the wall and everything else seemed to hint that i was dealing with a more recent film that the became an the last N minutes were the longest in the movie history the film just refused to end is there 
 we brought this film as a joke for a friend and could of been our worst joke to play the film is barely and the acting is dire the worst child actor ever used and giving a performance the plot is and at points we was so we was wondering what the hell was going on it tries to be in places but is just terrible 
 this movie was absolutely terrible the only explanation i can think of for the good reviews it received from some here is that they were written by people in the cast it was actually painful to watch this movie even my ages could not bear to watch it as far as i know this movie never made it to theaters and for good reason it 's as if some people were sitting around having a beer and said let 's 
 ok i 'll be honest when i first saw the for the i thought it was an for some product with all the people walking around on the beach despite this i decided to watch it thinking it would be some new show i could at but i was seriously the first N seconds of the program i was why is he lying in the trees why did the plane crash etc 's not everyday that a show comes along 
 a number of factors make it easy for me to state that i still think this is the most important science film ever made despite some of the acting dialogue there is the scale of in describing the a race native to the planet now all dead who were N million years more advanced than earth humans us and their technology particularly the N N cubic mile there is the music and sound effects which are from each other it 
 how do two great actors off a piece of junk like this on my only conclusion is that they and their director believe that any film in which they star just must be seen and now to the film probably the worst i have ever seen the actors showed minimal the plot was reasonable for a hour time not N minutes the fbi agent was almost a silly his partner was apparently struck and spoke not one word to robert

 ' is one of the most interesting movies that i have ever seen i experienced extreme frustration while watching this movie as i was for the two leads to that never happened in the end which disappointed me to no end but the ending an even more touch to a generally movie it is not a movie which people are likely to but one watch itself will have a deep impact on people as of now i have n't the

 there seems to be a spectrum of on the left there are movies made mostly for entertainment commercial purposes in the middle there are movies that are both entertaining and artistic on the right are movies that are not as commercial but are focused more on as art than as 'm not here to say any one part of the spectrum is better than any other but that when a movie goes too far to either end it 's rarely 
 fans of the naked gun or get smart will certainly enjoy this that won one and was for four is agent N a man who would n't know a clue if it hit him upside the head he is also a reflection of the attitude of the of the russian and around him are just as stupid but there is and the to keep things N 's ability to pick up play musical instruments the first time he picks them 
 there 's no other word for it fox dumped this out with no marketing of any kind nobody in the country other than those who have been looking forward to this film know anything about it all the red flags have it has to be a mess it ca n't be anywhere near as good as office space right wrong though office space it ai n't this film definitely has and it 's a on certain levels but who 's 
 this movie is awful it creates characters not in the book and some of them are ethnic or racial including an little jewish boy and a politically correct little black girl not to mention the speaking the book was a simple story about belief and this movie is a dark and scary movie about is but the story has been by good thing is that this movie will take a in the box office and maybe producers will learn to 
 john waters has made the most dark personal little film i think i 've ever seen well maybe fast food fast women comes in close second the directors vision is the is the characters are personal and odd of family and his own inner life the tone never forced or is no shot design or magazine is amazing as the sister eddie is inspired casting a with a talking mary recycled clothing yesterday 's garbage becomes today 's art and 
 when i first saw this film it was about N and even though i saw it again recently i have not changed my mind about it i think it was robert best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a in real life my father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse having to him just to get by and get through the day 
 i am it has been a while since the last movie i 've watched so i was really looking forward to watching a good ' movie was a major disappointment a reasonable story but awful acting dialogue and and lines i did n't even see the first one which is supposedly worse than this one now i am about how bad could that one have been the film is full of mistakes and who on earth dna using a blood

 and obviously i did n't see it but looking at the cast and seeing that doug masters is back from the dead i know now to avoid this like the i hate it when hollywood producers writers directors or all of the above think that audiences are stupid that they 're not going to catch errors a supposedly dead doug masters returning is a big giant one wo n't you say and i ca n't believe that someone like louis

 i have realized that many people have on the nature of this show being and but i do n't feel that is what this show is show is about parents who were n't ready for kids and are now not ready for this show helps to bring humor to a very hard topic that is sometimes over looked we have all had shows that had families in it for example family matters step by step family ties full house but 
 no blood no sex though it passion no special effects but just one of those that comes across your movie screen when you 're not really looking and your attention great acting great sets great music beautiful if only there were a lot more movies made like this one the sets move us through time and make us feel like we were acting appears like real life and us to the level of awareness of to whom is a lost

 i do n't usually like to comment on the acting in a movie because it is the one thing that people who have agenda against a film will go after in this movie i will make an exception the acting in this film are below average all around i mean into the film i wonder how the hell did the producer the director gets around casting such an of people who ca n't act the production value was good the 
 's birthday is right around the corner and she 's just her with boys but it turns out that all the guys that she spends time with all wind up murdered in this generic 's film it 's up to the local town dan burke hopkins the wild bunch and his daughter friday the part N to get to the bottom of these film focuses more on the mystery and aspects of the movie and less on the killings themselves 
 this movie is so i loved it it was really scary i love the movies and all movies and this one ranks way up there it probably helped that i watched it at midnight if you want a real scare rent this one 
 the is a really good and pretty disturbing i think we can all agree that the chances of running into a are much bigger than running into or that 's exactly why this movie is so scary during this film you 'll probably think about your own a few times whether he 's capable of doing such things you better his wife does n't on him that 's what the story is all about a respected in la when he 
 even the first N minutes of this movie were it 's hard to believe that anybody other than john would have put money into this with a string of movies already being destroyed at the box office it 's almost that a studio of any kind would want itself associated with this first it may have seemed like some kind of politically motivated derivative of point blank with and s all over again but only about N seconds into the 
 this is better than the early films but nothing more than your basic story the theme has been told before too nothing original is left except the weird atmosphere which is not that strong here with the amusing sexual and shore 's dark score the story never your full attention it just flows forward event after event with boring pace rating 
 if you want a fun with of humor then you will enjoy this do n't understand why anyone would n't enjoy this one take it for what it is a vehicle for dennis to mess with your head and make you it ai n't shakespeare but it is well done is absolutely beautiful and holds her own in this one better than any episode of and shows a for humor too bad she has n't had many opportunities to expand 
 troubled men 's magazine well played with considerable intensity by michael has in which he his models when the lovely start turning up dead for real worries that he might be the killer william the story at a steady pace builds a reasonable amount of tension a few effective moments of violence one woman who has a plastic garbage bag with a in it placed over her head rates as the highlight puts a emphasis on the drawn and engaging 
 this is a written and well acted psychological drama it is not really a so those looking for something like the ring or the will be disappointed what really surprised me about this film was the intelligence and attention to detail in the plot and the effort made to be consistent i also the absence of dr. phil or new age rather than advancing an agenda the just told the story told it well and let the think about it

 the last film in ' is a production it is often considered the of the original but i think it is a above episode and just a below episodes iii and in fact i think it is the third best film in the as far as i 'm concerned it is still a entertaining film it is not a movie with a beginning and ending the film 's mechanism operates with only one goal in its mind bring to ' 
 how to take charles 's intellectual and turn it into a his and ideas and their radical influence on western thought and capitalist society are except for two brief scenes in one of which it is claimed he is killing god pure to make the movie emotional and the rest of the movie to that purpose it consists entirely of and long family scenes with music at which one is to cry anyone who actually read of would be aware 
 this film was a disaster from start to finish with performances from the next generation of beautiful losers are interviews with bono and the edge as well as the performers themselves this leaves little time for the of leonard cohen himself who towers over everyone else in the film with his commanding yet presence wisdom and humor the rest are too busy trying to him as st. leonard or as some old many of the performances are especially & 's

 if you do n't like bad acting poor ridiculous and characters you will hate this movie if you like all of the above that is to say if you are a lynch fan then you will love drive this is quite possibly the worst film to be rated above an on of watts work you will be hard pressed to find any competent acting in dr. the other female lead went to the hide your face with your hands when 
 i heard about this film and knew it was n't real good but i started watching the film on my and was interested this could be a really great black on in media the small on every were good it build up to something i would n't miss but when the so called show starts everything becomes cheap and rather silly here 's where the writer should have added something that would make people think but instead it 's up 
 i picked this title up from a friend who had it sitting in his collection so i did n't personally have to pay for it i had an that it would be a bad film but i know what a truly bad film is after watching like children should n't play with dead things and the strange creatures who stopped living and became and now there is truly nothing that me unless it is crisis is bad but it does 
 i went to see this film over men in fact buying the tickets to men and going to the other because it looked like a fun movie with action and exotic locations they had all that but so do a lot of movies with a conception of i can say is why why why why did they not just make it a straight instead of some is all the movies from what i 've seen the film was derived from 
 all the are making one big mistake this movie was not to be taken was made for kids and of the late or early and as such it was truly a film of it 's time if you that period or love the first movie so much that you ca n't even take a joke about it then this is garbage but only because it was n't meant for you the low budget here and failure of the N at 
 the plot of dr. peter sellers in a of the characters created by is an to the end of sellers ' career the plot was very and if done the right way could have been handled but instead it was poorly executed part of the reasons why this film was n't that good was the poor cheap and an feeling that the film was somewhat acting on the other hand was really the only thing that kept my interest during 
 i love the format that chris guest and crew have developed over the years i actually like this and waiting for better than tap which was the first of the group and made by but guest and several other of his this humor is not for everyone it 's rather and not too physical so some people may not however as a dog and a dog show fan i loved this movie there are so many funny lines in it 
 i simply understand why all these from the era refuse to let go one can see clearly how frustrated they were during the censorship that them so many things to show in their movies and now they imagine its what big deal of freedom so fill the screen with people and any other kinds of this is not friends and neighbors this is simply forget about about david lynch about and and other movie makers who were able to work 
 a good korean film about not just but what its takes to be good like a way of fighting can not beat a guy in his sport because there are rules just as there are to life and school and this film has of this arts in the film is n't that good but it is and friends who go on to achieve something they once would become stronger through the mind and heart this film is n't meant to

 the first ten minutes of just looking really the direction most of this movie takes is a N year old boy living in new york in the he has a burning desire to see two people have sex who are the best people he has in mind well his own mom and of course how unfortunately for he is caught before he sees anything and is sent away for the summer to stay with his uncle and his uncle 's 
 a female played by the thomas ii has the fun job of all the of all the men on death row before they meet their maker and what a way to go lucky this film is not real or we would have a lot more people in this world on death starts out real slow low light and bad acting like most b films it gets better as it moves along and ends with a would rate it very high 
 von is an extremely good film how 's that von has a very way to tell a story at least he did have with to me the whole film was like an experience even if i did see it on a small television screen even with all the in my opinion this film is the most complete real and moving piece of then most of the films on the top N list i also think it is perhaps the the 
 it 's kind of to me that so many consider this a i am not a as far as quality films go and i will agree that from a technical standpoint as well as for several of the characters portrayed the film is in an class but there is no sense for me of this film actually going anywhere i mean taking the anywhere it is a series of mood scenes perhaps remarkable as such but i want more from 
 this movie wasted my time i saw only part of it and i was about the wasted time that i could of spent doing something productive and useful this earth for everyone that has watched this movie more than once i am blaming them for global warming as the the amount of black that got entered into the earth from this piece of were not needed and if they came from a different movie i would have them robin williams 
 i just finished watching this film for me the most outstanding work in this film was the music score while many silent film scores work very well with their scenes i feel that this is the best score i 've come across the scenes in particular worked extremely well 
 i saw this on the shelves at the rental place and i have everything else so i said why not why not is because it 's one of the worst movies i have ever seen it looks like it was shot with home i guess all the budget would allow there was less in it than i thought there would be some people made it out to be soft with a few killings the part of the whole movie to 
 the movie deserves stars for the girl i 'm sorry i 'm i think pretty girl is the only highlight of the movies and for the fact that it is shorter than i watched N and N in N i myself being able to sit through it lets talk about the plus points of the movie the girl is all there is to salvage the whole movie the fact is if the main character was male i am sure that 
 its a good film set in vienna about a driver donald who a passenger 's identity when the passenger is shot sitting in the back of his this gives him an identity as he is an illegal but he needs to play out the role of the victim until he a flight to the u.s. with a ticket in the victim 's name joan him but she is accused of having mental problems by her husband francis a concert as

 i picked up time because it looked like a nice time travel movie and i was in the mood for something like that the said it had something to do with some stuff and time travel but i did n't expect a christian film the movie had decent special effects and an interesting that could have gone places and been far more interesting than it ended up being our hero who is a professor from the eventually forward to the 
 my take on this at our local festival where people would see me so often they thought me a better source than i may actually have been began with a head shake well i ca n't the plot but it 's a really character study of an extremely scary man then slight embarrassment i ran into someone who actually knew what had gone down that is from whom gets his new heart it 'd been my last film in a 
 what can i say about this such a big but in the end wasted time wasted work a disaster is historically seen only some examples often is named ' his first name but the old do n't used this name correct would be the and or the ' ' ' was shown as wife but this historically wrong was shown as nice young woman but she was n't one and maybe and arrogant behavior was the cause of her she 
 this is the movie that i use to judge all other bad movies and so far there has n't been anything only good thing i can say is that after watching this i know that i have seen the worst movie i will ever see 
 this movie has the of being the worst movie i have ever seen and the only film i have ever given a N out of N on as of yet i was into it because of the cool cover art on the box this cover art is the only thing the least bit good about this pile of it was about boys fighting in a strange but not the least bit interesting post world where the cities are in but 
 so many of us who are devoted to the art of the motion picture will or forget that movies are also business ventures most of the time they are far too costly to produce to be anything else in light of this it often seems a to me that really great ones do get made every now and then once in a while the will go so far over budget in producing a film that the businessmen responsible for funding 
 director stays true to his own play it straight and they will and with the help of a cast has what should become the # N film of all time mystery men ' when an evil rush is released from a mental institution the local amazing and threatens to take over champion city three mr. ben the william h. macy and the blue come to the rescue has been joined by a of however and has become a opponent the 
 without doubt one of the worst films ever made sluggish and without structure tension or story the film on the thin of putting together a show conflicts are resolved within two or three seconds of their inception and dialogue is random and everything is put together in a order and often stepping out feels more like a scenes than an actual movie the film seems to exist merely as a for and totally random musical numbers can be seen in 
 i love this movie and have seen it quite a few times over the years it does get better with every i agree with all of the positive reviews here yes it 's and realistic as life on the was in those days i found myself doing commentary as i watched it someone on here said torn was i could n't disagree more he is brilliant as the stewart who says little and works like a farrell is as the 
 i am so confused what in the world was this movie about what was the killer 's he seemed quite angry but i have yet to figure out why nothing in this movie made sense it had zero or less than zero which i guess would make it a hill or a pile of the acting was horrible when i searched for a few of the actors in this movie they had been in very few things that i had 
 the third film i got to watch at the film was this outstanding drama from japan after breaking out of prison nine escaped plan to find the key to the universe that a who did n't break out told them about along the way we get to know each of these men fairly well each has their own dreams for much of the movie it seems to be mostly a comedy but a shift takes place that the film ends 
 at the is one of those movies with a story that 's more interesting than the movie itself this was 's comedy for during his year of and his first here he played one of his last roles although the 's was yet to come and it also marked one of the last times he would work for a director other than himself in fact 's conflicts with director and almost got him fired from the had n't gotten along 
 have n't seen any of the japanese but i really enjoy this one i rarely get scared when watching films i can jump if the effect and sound is startling enough but getting scared from a movie is a rare thing for me but i did get scared from maybe because i did n't expect anything at all when i watched it i did n't expect getting scared i did n't know anything about it either that was probably a 
 this film is about a who is struggling with his social status in school he is a good christian and feels that he is missing out on all the fun in high school so he wishes he had never become one after getting his wish and trying a he that his quality of life has been dramatically diminished and wants to go back to being the person that he was good film with a positive message of being proud of 
 my mom and i went to see this film because my brother is serving in the u.s. peace corps in the same region in which it 's set through the film i decided that given its failure to measure up to what it to accomplish the title is the subject it deals with could have made for an excellent but because of its poor execution it left me far less educated about the issue than i had hoped to become 
 i first saw this film in the theater way back in the when i was a kid and always remembered the ending there is nothing like the first impression but some movies are always a treat each time they are viewed something just with them this is one of those films and i agree with another who said lang should have directed more to add to it i have always liked scott and robert young in fact robert young stars 
 i 'm doing a on the the female cross and am using the the book as my main text any comments on and sexual identity and sexual confusion as a performance as a as an fantasy and as revolution the effect of the male etc etc would be much but a bit off the point has anyone seen toledo 's N film its about a young possibly cross i 'm dying to see it because i think it 'd be 
 i 've seen all four of the movies in this series each one further and further from the books this is the worst one yet my problem is that it does not follow the book it is titled after in any way the directors and producers should have named it any thing other than love 's the only thing about this movie that resembles the book are the names of some of the characters henry clark and the of the 
 overall performance at last the long waiting hits the screens unfortunately it could n't set fire in the audience the first best thing to talk about the movie is the idea of the mighty and made a nice choice of changing the total backdrop of the movie if he repeated the same backdrop people will again say there is nothing new in this different background is but the way he presented it is not worthy right from the start of 
 especially by lambert this is the essential 's that i grew up reading when i was a kid i have read a few negative reviews on this film and could n't help but wonder what their issue was they obviously did n't see the movie i did or they were expecting something that was more to the saturday afternoon was the that was of the novel and the film makers should be for the source material and taking it seriously 
 probably the best picture producers corp ever made this little piece the attention from first to last director frank obviously knows a good story when he writes one and what 's more important he knows how to realize its full shock potential on the screen not only is the plot involving and the characters drawn but the setting is absolutely out of this world just about all the action takes place either at night or in the middle of a 
 once again is faced with the dilemma of who to shoot bugs of he 's of what season it is and bunny and duck arguing help matters not though bugs proves he 's the once more by repeatedly using reverse psychology on in increasingly ways and when that runs out he does his trademark out and demands the bunny be shot though is too stupid he is in love with the girl bunny thing really is to blame for all 
 final score N out of N possible scene specific but who the hell yes that 's right zero and i rarely give N 's even for the of movies i look for things like music it 's humor even a good pace to be as objective about the score as possible looking at it within it 's own or but there is absolutely nothing here i ca n't remember another time a movie actually sent me up and down the 
 this movie is a very realistic view of a police in a small german town as seen through the eyes of a woman recruit she brings her way of dealing with the law which means more than simple convictions the strong performance of the main character supported by good makes this very 
 each frame in the movie is a lesson to new directors or existing directors to know how a movie should be taken hats off to he is underestimated in indian film industry the director has got all the in taking this movie in the range of ray every character is portrayed effectively in the movie though it 's simple story it 's been taken to such extent it can be considered to one of the best in india i do 
 first snow has an intriguing beginning a traveling salesman has his fortune told by an old man who 's predictions turn out to be correct from this point on the movie plays out like a bloated zone episode i mean nothing but car trips phone calls and william gives his usual interesting performance but guy is anything but a sympathetic character other people 's well being for the of his own the ending is especially weak with absolutely no for 
 based on the comic of well-known artist this feature was a slight disappointment to story is good but the is merely ok while it have been the movie is imo adequate but seems somehow flat & if you know what i mean a wasted opportunity if you consider that another work by ghost in the shell is considered a classic in many it set new standards for japanese and spawned among other things a brilliant series called stand alone complex 
 home room was a great movie if you 've ever had drama in your life it keeps you wanting to see more wondering what the secret is i think i watched that movie N times in a row and never lost interest plus i usually do n't cry over movies but this one made me cry each time i wish i could find more movies like that one all in all i thought it was a great movie the more 
 my take even photography can salvage a familiar script and characters for those who have n't already got enough of the free pictures might serve up a decent rental others are heavily suggested to stay away although is affair it hardly anything for the adult audience unless it 's your first time to see a of a N 's tv show and film may have sound like a good idea back then a the life of boy and a girl 
 a stunning occurs when some sort of phenomenon takes place be it going off a a hurricane devastating everything in it 's path or for that matter any other spectacular in the case of the family however was something which was no more complex than their day to day lives in the early century was an environment which was rough and tumble the family was of four people the father a minister who was driven to raise his family properly 
 bad acting yes but it was not a surprise stupid story yes so what but why tell me director why all that slow motion fight scenes were bad really bad because of slow motion and bad cutting not because of what if i just speed this up for N seconds and then slow down those next N seconds and then maybe i need to the coin to decide what were you thinking director 
 as an altman fan i 'd sought out this movie for years thinking that with such a great cast it would have to be at least marginally is one of altman 's thrown together and or so it feels with the hope that it would all come together in the room it points out this turkey is notable only for the debut performance of who the all around her but other than that avoid at all costs which is pretty 
 land was sponsored by international and does have a lot of political but there 's so much more to this story than that this is not just about the political tension of the late it 's about the personal that a woman puts herself through as a child who was by a family friend we see the to the parallels of a structure and the culture of sexual where one in four young children are and one in three women 
 there is no greater to do to history than to it this takes the and most route simply portraying him as a monster only showing his negative sides and them those who are of the past us to repeat it he was a human being that may prove tough to some people to accept but an important part of life is facing that which we do n't want to rather than the man we ought to try to understand him 
 i would n't bring a child under N to see this with off of buildings through dangerous machines and listening to 's scary to name a few of the events there is entirely too much for a small child the live action gives a more feel than the version and there are quite a few moments including some guy that seems to be a a lot of moments that will worry and may small do n't know what the disney 
 in the extreme camera work especially camera operators need n't spin around all the script is truly and the acting is even worse on top of that the story is and with some in logic at one point the lead wishes to get thrown in jail in order to with suspected and thus get an interview with i found the story entirely as a result of so many flaws the role really a rash boy the only item of interest 
 i first viewed this movie when it first came out and also bought an recording of the i liked it so well i went back to see it several times can not understand why it was considered a was lovely in this film her voice was in top form and the was beautiful the film contains a little bit of everything and even though some of the scenes were a bit they were still fun i recently found i could 
 i know that of a beauty and of a virgin are films and are by many but i 'm put myself under the bus here and say i like especially of a beauty of a beautiful woman watched it the other night with some folks at the and i was surprised how well it actually went is the type of that you really just do n't find too much of outside of asia specifically japan in this case it 's

 i saw an advanced for this movie tonight i absolutely loved it the movie kept me on the edge of my seat all night murphy is extremely as the for those of you who have seen batman begins his character was much in this film he played his character very well the bad guy i have seen in was great everyone in the audience and cheered at the same time as if we were on the is held through out 
 i saw this drama by cable tv although i saw just two series i love this drama i 'm waiting for more series will be aired by though it describes horrible absurd situation in a prisoner 's camp this one shows us an spirit friendship and they do n't know whether they can survive or not but kept their hope strongly without being discouraged by know this movie is not realistic like other war but i do n't want to 
 there is one detail which is not very common for chan movies but which is present here it has some very tough and serious atmosphere about it while the funny elements are present too is and here he is not a hero who is attacked and only then fights back in a usual pattern but he is the one who can go and start the his manner of hitting that evil guy in the is amazing every time it goes 
 there was a reasonably good looking girl the film but even her looks could n't stop me from voting it the lowest possible plot is bad and more can i say the movie 
 heroes is a N film jeff williams and story concerns a family that becomes even more when the oldest child ordinary people has been mentioned often in to this film it 's sort of ordinary people with a role reversal the mother in this case is more accessible than the father ben who is clearly and unable to cope like ordinary people the younger son tim is the focus of the me the film was enough to keep watching but 
 i saw the movie late one night on cable and could not believe how bad it was i usually enjoy bad movies but this one was so that it was n't even entertaining some of the of this film include the absurd music which is constantly playing throughout the movie the special effects when someone is shot with a laser gun they turn green and promptly and the acting the acting in fact is what i feel the show i 
 this review contains was searching through movie on when i came across flight of the living dead i already knew from the name that it was going to be and most probably a of on a plane but it was selling brand new for so i figured i did n't really have much to music played over the opening credits did n't fit at all although i did like the song itself a song is n't really suitable to appear 
 a truly horrible film that left me feeling by having watched the minutes or so i could stand not the actors ' fault but the producers financiers etc. need a very stiff talking to maybe it thinks it is it is n't this rape and unlike that central to orange has nothing to say about or add to the sum of human understanding it 's no dogs either to which i have seen it compared rather it feels like something 
 well let 's be fair following up a classic like road house is no easy task now from the equation and you get a task so with patrick not on board whose idea was it to proceed anyway and make this piece of garbage i am going to blame the director who did n't even provide N minutes of decent throughout the entire film i was actually shocked they got will to jump on board did an ok job with 
 i found this film rather brilliant initially i wanted a when animals attack along the lines of or even but was delivered a truly that was not of having been to the areas this was made including the farm at the start of the movie even sharing the same guide it added to the fear factor those really are everywhere up there though i do n't think they had the attitude of this yes there were some moments but they 
 the most famous thing about this movie is that this was the first time talked in a motion picture aside from that ' if you want to call it that this is a movie that does n't go beyond with trying her best not to fall plot involves returning to her father after N years abroad her father who is a on a is happy to see her even though she 's acting a bit she soon falls in love 
 after watching stop-loss i find myself against disappointed in hollywood for making such a gone are the days of glory of the films of the N 's that made one proud to be an american fighting the that abroad and death at home what we are left with is at the mouth of the story tells of three young men who return home from the war one into in his death the main his country at a time of war 
 when i read most of the other comments i felt they were way too for this movie i found it had completely lost the spark found in the earlier movies and just goes to prove that after a long absence from the screen it 's often best to just let things be i completely agreed with the star from another who compared the first star movie to the original series of excited fans were waiting and waiting and waiting for 
 i do n't see what everyone liked about this movie the was too long and and when it was done the main character remained as flat and as he had been in the first scene after the film finally got into the hotel room i had to wonder well what 's going to happen here for the next hour or so to keep me engaged the answer not much just john having a long mental if the character had more

 the movie everything is comes from first-time jonathan 's first novel the book was ambitious and its elements and vivid use of language seemingly impossible to represent on screen the movie attempts less while the end result is not as wildly original as the novel it 's still an accomplished movie about a strange eastern european road trip or as one of the characters would have it a very rigid search that character is alex eugene a young man who 
 like many other here i went in expecting a taste of music that would satisfy my and got more than i asked for i heard and saw a powerful sometimes sometimes in the way and absolutely stunning of music and musicians reminded me a lot of some forms of indian music east indian but at the same time was very very from the the first track by to the singer what a voice to to the session or ' as 
 i saw this movie a few months ago in the town which appeared as in the movie which is the only reason i went to see it another local who was there just to me an announcement of a repeat showing because the first had sold out and people were turned away his editorial comment in his forward is a good summary unless you 're a neil young fan or live if the latter you know the real name this 
 to finally see what many consider to be the greatest film of all time i felt like i had accomplished something as ridiculous as that sounds boy it sure contained the elements i expected and delivered so much more a constant i 'm in these films is the and of the in the roles of preparing for escape while their and resolve not to mention being tested by their while most of them were hired for the way they look

 without actually giving away my age i saw this for the first time over N years ago when it first came out on video maybe it was a beta tape and i was old enough to drink barely and perhaps i had had a few because i remember thinking how great this movie was i have since seen it and have to admit it is a pretty bad film as mentioned in other posts the plot is absolutely ridiculous and

 i did not intend to write this review but having read the default review that shows up on this movie 's i felt to write a the movie in a word is it does not deserve the review that the writer has written i think the writer has totally missed the point of the movie to a large extent in fact i too was turned off by the excessive show of that occupied the middle of the movie to a 
 this film seems well made and more efforts should be made to promote films by women that aside this film is also disturbing in that it justifies the and of a character that is if you 've seen any of the promotional material you might think this is a film about a relationship that 's reached its end but none of that suggests how really disturbing the central is a woman threatens unless her soon to be agrees to here

 this is the ultimate of movies this year house of is one of the movies i 've ever seen this version really puts the vincent price version of the movie to shame i only know a few of the young cast in the movie the ever troublesome paris hilton the pain in the you know what seems to be more than ever at least she did n't try to copy her well if she likes to do she 's better 
 this move actually had me jumping out of my chair in anticipation of what the actors were going to do the acting was the best should have gotten a for this she was james was so good i him he was the and played it wonderful there are n't many movies that have me as this one the cast was great looking shocked with those big eyes looking like a victim and you her as she went through it made

 what a dire film i can not believe that i actually sat down and watched it a very very very very very very effort with no features the so-called racing are awful and the plot was so bad i 've forgotten it part of the film was made at the course in belgium in i think N during the actual grand there i was there and am glad i did n't appear in any of the scenes shown in the 
 well i do n't know where to begin obviously this was a made for tv movie so my expectations were low i was surprised by the overall direction of the second hour but anything before or after that seemed to be a by the numbers sort of talk about bad chemistry between the i would go more in but this movie does n't really deserve it grade rating 
 people who thought that the of harder than the black hole that up event horizon probably did n't see the movie that spawned diesel 's killer to begin with and probably have no intention of doing so too bad because pitch black actually does kick major by david and the excellent but below and written by jim and ken wheat lies silent pitch black begins with an when a combination cargo ship is badly damaged by a in which the 
 it 's so bad it 's actually worth seeing just for that reason there are some things in it such as the device the bad guy is seen working on for the whole movie that turns out to be this tiny helicopter that around carrying and a machine gun without so much as a but is brought down by a bag of the kind they release at political many other wonderful of that sort stars charlie there 's one scene

 kasparov vs. deep blue is no doubt a story but i do n't think you 'd know it by watching this movie i think it focuses too much on the conspiracy theory that ibm and what does this theory upon the idea that at one point the computer made a move that looked human i am not a or a computer scientist and while i do n't doubt that the move looked human to me it does n't seem beyond 
 first of all there is theatre then there is both have their strengths and fan following director shah should look elsewhere instead of theatre when making a production first he made adapted from a play which had a unique plot but could not hold as a film now he 's adapted another play and named it a race against time in sum the are the plot development is not for films for example the role play between father and son

 i have tried to like this show i really have but i ca n't find a reason why anyone would like it the story lines are weak the acting is weak and every cast member seems to have been picked up off the street at random and it seems to me that the whole show is just a vehicle for jamie lynn to be able to move on to movies every episode shows as the girl that every girl wants

 i really do n't understand why people get so upset and pan this movie remember folks this is an movie not anything that is supposed to be and original in plot or direction the man is a movie stupid at times with a cast and as usual wonderful performances by will and tim yes some of the jokes are stupid and yes the characters are but its comedy i really do n't understand how anyone could n't a lot during 
 shakespeare in love has nothing to do with herself but painting going with her friends on her up and down saying to people in town and trying to match make everybody she knows i guess there were no movies no television in those days and the had nothing to do but i wish she had read a little more i like and think that she is a lovely young woman she is and in one has the privilege to hear 
 i too was by the packaging i too fell for the packaging and the that claims fans as every copy was pulled from shelves though it was $ it was n't really all that worth it no and very limited the ending was very and did n't deliver the it should have i really do n't even know how it became a video nasty with how very it is the story the characters are obvious actors it does n't live 
 i ca n't believe they got the actors and of that to do this movie that 's all i 've got to say the movie speaks for itself 
 directs three parallel stories that have to do with fantasy and in the adult world in one of them is a sort of story where a rejected architect attempts to manipulate a group of people into of only his attempt misses it 's only real target the woman that he after in the same he built a group of teachers search for love in a more modern story as one woman believes in the role of and the tries to 
 this movie is not the same as the N version with and james mason and that is a shame because the N version is in my opinion much better i am not denying 's talent at all she is a good actress and brilliant singer i am not with 's other work and therefore i ca n't pass judgment on it however this movie leaves much to be it is slowly it has and language and can be very difficult 
 this film is about aging in post war tokyo played by the incredible money to two other and and they the way she is somewhat about it has a son a daughter who during the film announce they 're leaving them while never a mother gets visits from two men in her past who it turns out just want money from her its a compelling tale of what choices you make what you do to get through life and who 
 this film is very indeed unfortunately not for the reasons the film makers would 's a serial killer too but he 's not what 's either he 's just your standard comic book a cross between and freddie though with nothing particularly fresh to add to either for even the and most of criminals can they be in a stress position on their feet arms N hours a day week in week out i in the world that gave us

 i 've seen a few movies in my time but this one is you 'll have to watch it more than once to truly appreciate it it is very complex it love and passion at it 's most extreme and it 's is just the character of the count is intensely and without him having to raise his voice or indeed leave his bed the film is perfectly cast and perfectly acted the film has a sort of precision and 
 have i seen a worse movie perhaps only the hands of fate dragged more than i had more fun at the plot than the movie gave me at any point let 's touch on a few there was a script death and when is talking to the and they do n't respond he and moves on since neither the or scott know what he 's talking about nor do we it was like the engine died and was few times 
 a pretty movie of the variety specifically similar to in that it stars an aging character actor in this case a step down a bit to the level of who puts in the only distinguished performance i 've seen him give in a role as a man whose life is and who subsequently decides to use his animal friends to exact on those who have him yes this is one of those movies where pretty much everybody is so that 
 the absurd idea of having the killer on the at an island resort where there is no snow or cold weather brings back the spirit of the returning thanks to a scientific experiment providing foreign elements which life to his it 's the best i could do to explain this concept could go into about how he up at the island in order to numerous tourists but i simply find no reason to bother because it 'd all be so 
 moon child was one of the more movies i 've seen what i really liked about it was the illustration on and the obstacles and through life the movie a great deal of having the power of and the advantages to it whether if it is having or life these are what humans usually wish for moon child shows the pain and of being since the feelings loss almost all the characters especially to the main characters and the meaning

 i just watched along with another movie about trafficking and child sexual called trade at film by the sea international film festival i have to say that trade out of the water is a powerful and amazing film on many different levels from an artistic and perspective it is amazing the camera and acting are all spot on additionally the way it handles the subject matter is and it presents the issue of child sexual in a way that is 
 ann & andy is the first movie i ever saw in the theaters my took my sister and i and the funny thing is when we got home asked us what do you want to do now and we said we want to watch ann & andy again and my actually took us back to the theatre to watch it again at least that 's how i remember it i was five years old at the movie was pretty scary 
 strange how less than N hours can seem like a lifetime when sitting through such flat if a story is as personal as this supposedly was to would n't you expect a little passion to show through in her performance her acting was completely and i felt no chemistry between and and the scenes which should have been given the nature of the dance were instead and painful to watch obviously such a personal story on film can be and 
 better than the original the rising manages to pull off a funny comedy with good acting fine special effects and comedy that the and do so on a low budget i 've seen many films that have been terrible and almost none that have been as good as their counterparts this film most mainstream movies away parts are a bit weak the bit with the and goes on a bit long without explanation and takes you out of the movie 
 we do n't know why this extraordinary film was never made available officially on anthony 's performance alone makes this a there are relatively few films in which an actor so with his character a phenomenon always unique for us 's powerful portrayal of an innocent literally dragged out of his house and everyday life by forces he can not is only part of what makes this film great the script is based on a book published in paris by

 although it really is n't such a movie especially considering it was made directly for it 'll be very difficult to point out one aspect in that is actually original or in space is n't exactly a new formula and even after so many movies dealing with these in this particular setting still no one seems to realize it 's an stupid that ca n't possibly result in a decent movie even goes one step further and every motion picture

 this is a horrible little film and unfortunately the company that made this short made several others the short is essentially a idea that was n't funny to begin with and may also you it certainly made me uncomfortable watching very young children most appeared about N about and to be adults in this case a girl and bar room it 's the sort of humor that you might be forced to at from your own kids if they to

 who wrote this some guy named john cohen i guess this was the first he 's ever worked on someone should 've told him you 're supposed to write that sounds like something someone actually might who directed this scott son of marshall my the has fallen far from the tree someone might have wanted to let him know that you can in fact shoot a scene in a in new york and it will look real and you wo 
 i should have gone without seeing the movie after reading the review here i saw the whole movie by fast and ended in N minutes though its a low budget movie it could have been made better the movie starts more like a and in few minutes it tells you that you should switch off immediately and why was the movie named crash landing when it was landed so well in such a bad climate without any acting all the 
 displays his already developed understanding for in this early silent film the plot of the film involving two fighting over a girl is drama without much to recommend it 's talent though is found in his stunning use of images nearly every shot is filled with especially is the jewelry that one gives the girl just before she the other he it up her arm in a clearly sexual way and with one simple movement has shown us all we 
 i had no idea that mr. was so damn funny it really the mind that he is not more well known his command over the crowd and his timing is about star wars will kill too if only all the stand up performers had his 
 as a i can appreciate the incredible physical strain the must have to get the shots this series is much more than that though the is perfect the scenes on and the subject matter the day to day struggle for life taking place out of the view of we is mind this set has open my eyes to another planet right here on earth i urge everyone to watch this series 
 this is an extremely involving series that is well and a sensitive subject with great we follow michael as the fbi agent set to a cell lead by the series is very well written and has enough plot to keep you sitting at the edge of your seat waiting for whatever happens is by my definition one of the best actors i 've seen portraying an agent cold on the outside but still a good human being trying his best 
 when i bought this i though it seems to be a nice light comedy about love and relationships made up in standards let 's give it a chance i was totally wrong what a disappointing movie first it 's not a comedy it 's a cheap drama which can be so that it 's even worse than many soap second the plot is so boring and leads nowhere it has no structure it just flows like the wind in one 
 the is a film that not many people have seen clearly not that many because it only got a there is nothing wrong with it at all it 's my favorite of the disney which have tons of films already made like beauty and the snow white and peter pan the reason why the is so high on my list is because of how funny the film is i hate to say this but i do n't blame edgar for 
 this is by far the most and version of the ever to be devised as a fan i was by what they did to the characters but this is not worth watching even if you are n't familiar with the for example would never people in the back just to get down a would never have a string of women in his bed never had an affair with nor with whoever the she is would not shoot tony in the 
 ever since i 've been allowed to play once again it 's been impossible to get my mind off it i 'm surprised i could have gone without it it is without a doubt one of the greatest games of all time i have never played any other shooting games but i know that this one rules above all most people blame it for too much violence but i find that ridiculous there may be a few but there 's 
 given that a lot of films are based on the that one or more of the central characters does something stupid at some stage during the proceedings the in this film would be collecting gold silver and at a olympic a disabled would have made better choices than they did and would have a lot less while doing you like films with a picture deliberately my N a with better results extremely poor sound and no then this is your

 i 'm a big fan of morgan freeman redemption ' ranks at the top of my favorite movies but i have to admit that i have often about his choice of roles so many of his titles were big budget with no heart items or less ' for me marks the return of freeman to a role that truly his considerable acting plays an formerly big time hollywood actor who has n't worked in several years he has been offered 
 just never before have i seen a movie in which it seemed like a bad that somebody wrote one day in N minutes and then i happened to come upon lady this movie takes everything you know about and turns it completely upside down and not in a good way if you 've seen this movie you either across it on italian tv or you have the dubbed version on the N box set like i have as number and 
 when john is on he 's on and this is one of his better films not quite as tight as but close to it and with much of the same cast this film was very well written very well put together and very well shot there 's very little to and most of my complaints are where did get the money for N years of college and a lot of expensive stuff no mention of a rich background and why 
 as films go rest stop could have been better in many levels john shows he probably had the best intentions when he started it unfortunately either he was not sure as to what to do with the material or maybe he was under pressure to deliver a different movie from what he intended either by the studio or the backers several have been included in the but unfortunately the one chosen for the finished product is probably not the idea 
 i had to give this film a N simply because it did what so many films thrown at black audiences have failed to do this film was of all the video and it also the and language it examined several relationships among physicians african americans and african american romantic relationships on a completely new and level i was highly impressed with the films careful mix of light headed humor with some pretty tough and heavy issues the film will leave 
 this movie should have ended as soon as the joke about 's kids is told in the opening i liked robin harris and most of his comedy but the really funny were not meant to be something the whole family could go see it to taking the point of one of jerry 's jokes and attempting to squeeze the joke for as long as you can in order to turn it into a movie this movie had to be because 
 what can i say about this movie i have seen it quite a few times since the first time when i was around i have seen the english version and it is done very well it is a great movie for all ages but it is directed more for children i love the humor and appreciate it if you have not seen it you should try to rent a copy you will not be disappointed 
 nothing but the director 's fantasy come to life this ' is nothing more than an excuse for the to play face with an attractive young woman who would otherwise never give him the time of plot is simple the direction is and the movie while the do n't be by the ' x ' rating there is no and minimal 
 first i should mention that i really enjoyed 's previous film to skin man and girl although it owed a debt to 's pulp 's cast was up to the task of carrying the story and the entire film with energy the scenes between and were particularly engaging there was action bizarre enough sex to keep things interesting and an utterly story it was with a certain amount of anticipation and optimism that i began to watch party N and 
 with this film the with all of film 's might while clearly in the film that his work is one of ' obviously it is not for one reason many scenes by pure chance ' are obvious when that poor ' falls off the you can actually see the gun smoke on the right of the screen for another his of one important information the people were the way they were for a specific reason which is just hinted at 
 it is a real shame that nearly no one under N knows the over the top writing of michael magazine articles and that were for the time and so it is a true shame that anyone who may take the opportunity to research his work will no doubt take the easy way out and watch thus leading them to video this movie has elements that never fully to the funny bone the such things as cat with the man who 
 i was plagued by involving street and the show during my i loved the programs but when i i 'd dream about not unlike the ones on tv but not quite the ones on would speak and and while eating each other and killing each other they 'd take a of their felt and it would apart followed by bleeding nice but that was the past i love this show i saw peter jackson 's meet the years ago and 
 as you probably already know franco is one guy made hundreds upon hundreds of films many of which are however he managed to in an occasionally quality work all the assembly line is n't his best work either the dr. z or but it has many of his that make it a must for anyone interested in into his large catalog he combines the between showing and leaving left to the and the this is a very film full of 
 mild kind words are hard to find for me to describe the movie i have just been to that stars you the problems are far and wide and painful for me to yet i feel i must if only to prevent others from suffering the same as i did this is not a film for anyone under N it 's and when the big of and happens biggest and most important scene in the film nothing happens it is a 
 i am simmons has managed to do something i thought impossible he has made the on 's island look like citizen kane painful can not even begin to describe this piece of i do n't know mind you the sounded funny but now that i 've seen it it 's funny in the way that dropping an on your is wo n't bother to describe the as the title says it all if only to say i do n't think 
 i read the novel some years ago and i liked it a lot when i saw the movie i could n't believe it they changed everything i liked about the novel even the plot i wonder what did author say about the movie but i think it 
 growing up joe was a hero of mine but even i was left cold by this film for better and worse the future is is not a behind the music style rather it is a art film full of interviews performance home movies and mostly lifted from animal farm the movie is but by about a half format while in thought is actually pretty in execution first off without titles its hard to even know who half of these are 
 i have to start by telling you how i came across this was winter time in alaska around the year friend of mine from australia was staying with me and my girl friend in a box of an in alaska can be a bit and most people stay drink heavily and watch anything that comes on the had found this movie outside of a thrift store laying in a and right away new it was a is quite possibly the 
 why did n't the producers give that show a chance of all the junk on tv why did n't the producers give six degrees a chance will the series go on video i would love to see how it ends put season one on video and sell it i was a loyal fan of six degrees and waited for it 's return i set my recorder to tape all of the shows god for that i just found out that 
 i really enjoyed this movie about the relationships that sometimes developed between american and japanese women in japan as well as the obstacles that created for them goes from having for the japanese which is natural considering to falling in love with a japanese woman and wanting to her his performance is i am not a major fan of his acting style and the movie is throughout red received an for his performance of another who falls in love in 
 i have seen many japanese and i have to say that some of them are really interesting but they are all pretty much the same this one is no exception the ghost is a black girl that it 's victims by doing nothing else than walk and look dead the difference is just the motive for the the rest is the same as every time black girl strange things happening with some media photos acting while watching this i constantly 
 all i can say is before watching the movie i did not have a hint indication who was or what was her life story and i have to that the movie was hardly a help to reach these data and even it was not successful to persuade me to do some research by few words on however all i can say is that the actress was great with her expression she really played well and showed a deep depression mental 
 this film has some really impressive action scenes the humor and action are well though the intensity of the film does not sustain itself till the end the last scene is a slight in terms of action quality and of the scenes preceding it the humor does n't seem to be so as in many other movies and this film is of totally other class than most american of recent years acts as a typical who at orders from incompetent 
 these were two video shot movies that decided were horrible so in a desperate move turned into this one movie perhaps the on 's side helped spark the comedy but for whatever reason this is very funny stuff with an inspired bit with oliver stone doing commentary during the movie lots of lots of use of the song add to the fun parker ted strain etc etc one of the best of recent releases yes it 's all over the 
 what a surprise a disney direct to video that 's actually good the lion king N is a comedy affair that involves everyone 's favorite and and it starts out with them watching the original movie and making comments until complains that we 're not here yet after fighting over the and decide to tell the audience their story they start the new movie and the be honest i was losing hope in disney most of their fare has been 
 i watched beach on cable for a while and i sort of enjoyed it the fat guy is the best character as he seems to be a nice guy the rest of the characters are just various of young men and young black men i like to watch these low budget movies that capture a period of time because they are almost like a of the year 's attitudes and beach is also funny because the in this movie are 
 i want so badly to give this piece of garbage a zero unfortunately there is n't so i had to give it a N just to warn you about how terrible this of a familiar really is the characters look like they were drawn by no wait i 've seen do better i prefer of to this terrible excuse for a i 'm probably saying what others have said two words off remember that episode of 's lab when they 
 i have to be completely honest in saying first that i fell somewhere in the middle so i can not give a full opinion about the film until i see it in full basically a group of thieves including carter james and bernard plan to make a fortune stealing a shipment of contraceptive pills from hospital this is where title character works along with staff members sir bernard cutting kenneth williams dr. francis charles dr. terry scott and susan ball 
 for me the best & most movies are often those which on first i know nothing about american movie is a perfect example of just such a watching tv late one evening i spotted the one & only good review among the i settled in for a real treat american movie is a following the mark i believe a highly & as he struggles to write direct and produce midwestern a movie on which he has been working for years 
 as a great fan of the studios and enthusiastic of their films i wonder what took me so long to start watching their house of which only ran for one season in now that i 've seen the first four episodes of the show i can say that it easily my expectations so far while this first episode time is maybe not the most story ever told and does n't quite deliver the atmosphere that i love 's films from 
 worst film ever this is a statement that people here on often throw around whether it 's an movie bad like the hands of fate or the latest no brains summer action from michael bay people are often quick to jump to the sudden conclusion that on the board they 're posting that there is nothing worse in the movie envy these people because they 're and of how deep the hole of movie making really goes there are films 
 this movie has one of the i have seen for me that 's what makes it so fred and al lewis are very good at what they achieved in the original series while there was less they still worked together i wish de as would have had more plot involvement she showed that she could do comedy in the original series but it was mostly wasted in this movie this movie also stars the great but he does n't have 
 cut to the chase this is one of the five worst films that i 've ever that they did n't try there was some decent writing with some elements of structure in there a good cast some good acting i 'm not sure where it went wrong but it went of the elements may have been bad structure and no story a lot of by the lead who probably is much better when some bad and i had enough at

 though the title may suggest examples of the N it is a definitely incorrect assumption this is an of N seemingly unrelated stories from giovanni 's century story within a italian town 's largely peasant population it is a on the reality of sex and its consequences within that world and time a realistic view of life within this world it sometimes feels like a back in the human element of its time one can also see the more side 
 the movie lacks with the which did n't exist until the but no woman would do what was done here even a woman before the women 's movement of the and about the only portion of the movie that you could believe in was that germany would want to know where the landing would be ignore for the moment that the british had captured all the but even if they had not they would n't have let one around like 
 it 's been so long since i 've seen this movie at least N years and yet it still haunts me with a vivid image of the consequences that of war can face despite the terms of the geneva unit of australian experts are captured in an near japan following a successful mission to set mines in a japanese in prison these men expect the same treatment as any other but to their soon learn from a friendly japanese prison 
 perhaps the made in the usa runs short at N episodes in four the often criticism found in the a pretty good show in its own right and the in south park every bit of this series follows a plan the criticism of us society from its to its carries much more than it does in any other cultural in also tend to be sometimes anyone the fan sites will realize most have not even been caught in that it 
 the king of is a told story that pits the preference males against human preference for love and set in china during a time of we meet wang an elderly street performer whose are and capture the of all who witness him when a famous performer sees and then wang he invites wang to join their however we learn that wang 's family tradition allows him only to pass his secrets to a son learning that wang is wang is 
 a frustrating louis 's son who saw his father only during his because he was a member of just one of the three separate families his father had created takes on the task of trying to learn more about his father through an exploration of his architecture and his life it sounds like a great idea for a but it ends up flat and the basic problem is that 's son is not just one of the film 's he 
 the story of a downtown l.a. sounds like a nice plot for a disaster movie this one though is missed the movie looks chaotic has a which is hard to follow or believe and the acting was very in agreement with a lot of comments that lee jones is only good at people around as a chief in some particular field in this one he is heading the emergency office being chief of such an office it naturally is a 
 this is definitely not one of 's better by any stretch of the the plot is pretty bad a is murdered and his calls upon his daughter to find out who did it but the biggest problem i have with this besides knowing who killed him within N minutes of watching the movie was wondering why anyone should even care the father comes off as being a really big to everyone he came across including the daughter who he asks 
 finally a movie where the audience is kept until the end what will happen well we all kind of know that the lives of the brothers andy played by hoffman and played by will downward destruction since where else is there to go but down but we do not know how or when until near the end of the movie hoffman is as usual and even was decent as the younger brother who basically does what he is told since 
 well do n't bother this film looks so tired the acting is so old-fashioned and the plot and characters so that it should be studied instead of watched it is really a horrible waste of film nonsense and i watched it in with my mouth wide open how could such a film be made and more how could anyone find it funny or old tired sloppy a at best there is nothing there except for a study of very ancient 
 allen who i have to at the outset i have never been a big fan of directed this about the life of ray penn a N 's jazz whose star apparently for a while then quickly faded penn does a credible job in the role portraying a complicated and somewhat man not unlike allen himself which perhaps explains why would be attracted to this project who ca n't maintain relationships and whose aside from playing were shooting at the dump 
 american tourist on package tour in asia suffering recent decides to break law by N ignoring N joining revolutionary army N and using illegal etc etc what is meant to be a political and educational statement about the so called of a military in asia ends up as a how to travel guide for americans especially those who wish to protest that the water in the hotel does not work the authors of this silly have no clue about asia 
 what are people on here talking about i must have seen a different movie than you guys i was so that i walked out of the theater what is up with this stuff i only once and not even that hard whoever this movie should be taken out into the street and beaten i usually always find something i like in a movie but this is crazy makes not another movie look like a classic it ranks up there with 
 alfred 's is not one of his films made between two more popular and praised pictures and shadow of a doubt it 's generally regarded as a lesser effort i agree that the later film is drawing wholly into the american mainstream for the first time but is in its way at least as as its chief flaw being its less than star players bob and we find feeling his way around america literally as its lead character from california 
 jack brooks matthews is a college student with some severe anger issues his family was murdered when he was a child by a monster and now he takes out his anger on everything and when his professor robert begins to show signs of he he has to control his rage and use it for good instead of evil and fight the creatures that have been his ever since that earns its rating but what was cool about it was that

 american film makers decided to make a film they think is japanese the characters all badly represented the actors are not even japanese and the set is cheap and definitely does n't represent in early and who ever read the book understand that the script writers did n't add any extra value to the movie from the script worse they even changed the original plot line with a few marshall is using for his two main characters two well known

 everything about this film was terrible to start with this film had a pretty good cast and i find it impossible to make such a great cast into the biggest disaster to the film ever the sound track was like one of a very bad stick comedy it had this music through the whole film and it started to get quite please please please please do not yourself with this disaster you will only be hurt 
 oh this movie was bad for various reasons i was expecting to see a very low score for this film and was a bit surprised by the but to rate this highly as many have is a joke once you get past the one and white movie which was a nice idea the movie on even at a run time of only N minutes the credits at the start was so too in the van the guys suffer a flat 
 arising from characters previously developed in a series of the of the is about as far from family fare as you can get and with dialogue and this really is a movie that will appeal to almost every member of the story concerns and his dog who live in a village with growing large for the annual fair and who operate a solution to all those that everywhere the business is a great success but proves a bit too for 
 this version of open your eyes is more mature and more aided by 's is a lot tighter and more out than 's original the spanish should get credit for thinking of the story first but there 's no doubt that has improved on it if just slightly notice that you have no idea what the lead did in open your eyes but you know almost everything about the lead in sky that 's what i mean by more out 
 i just thought it was excellent and i still do i 'm we 're still able to see different stuff from what hollywood almost us with saving grace is smart and those who feel by the thing better go see the america 's sort of grace also shows that a funny movie does n't have to be stupid i was laughing my off during most of it but also questions about what was the female lead character supposed to do 
 the belief in the big other as an power structure which exists in the real is the most definition of this is a review of marathon man and the falcon and the two films by director john and lang brought the conspiracy to hollywood the only in the late and with films like the view z marathon man one the candidate three days of the and all the president 's men this was the age of vietnam and the public

 i am at the major comments here for this ok film it really stems from the california school of to beach and is n't really the idea that the lead kid learn to ride a board so well in a concrete wave pool that he the real at their game in the real ocean is just plain silly in australia where most urban do this film was at audiences took it all with a grain of sea salt made in 
 if you have not seen this late film about the the washington bureau of a network news station than i highly recommend it it is a sad commentary on the direction of news reporting in this country but tells the story with the characters are well developed and albert brooks performance is he all his lines with entertaining comedy i am not an albert brooks fan at all so this was a welcome surprise i have a friend who works 
 or as it 's more commonly known english speaking audiences starts with an battle as king & his army a load of guys although i 'm not sure who they were & the film itself is n't too helpful in establishing the fact anyway after king has all these guys maria & are forced to sign a treaty which lets king rule just about everything in sight soon after maria & they have sex meanwhile in the ever just two 
 this movie has a special way of telling the story at first i found it rather odd as it jumped through time and i had no idea the story line was although simple but still very real and you met someone the first time you fell in love completely but broke up at last and a deadly who has n't go through this but we will never forget this kind of pain in our life i would say i am 
 rouge is a very good film though it does suffer a bit since there have already been similar films in all too many ways the movie is of previous films such as and grand and many others so while director and the actors did great jobs it all seems like a case of because of this i had a hard time giving this excellent film a higher one unusual aspect of the film is how the get together instead of 
 i would just like to point out in addition to for the series to be released on that a show does not have to be realistic to be entertaining these days with all the blood and in the news and in crime reality shows etc it 's nice to get lost in a good show with entertaining characters fits the bill was it material no but it was just the also have to put a vote in for the second 
 makes a great of your new channel sound system the camera puts you right in the race car where you cruise around various tracks at high speed of the driving in grand if only that would appear on i enjoy watching it again and only minus and why i did n't give it a N is some of the driving look like the film was up the also requires a little suspension of all you can hear in a real 
 i found this movie to be quite and fairly entertaining good characters good actors and enough to keep your interest throughout the plot might have been a bit much but overall a decent if you liked this film i would recommend the spanish prisoner the house of games and no way out 
 first i like s but in this movie he has hit rock bottom and started to dig the plot what plot very strange and actions way below standards the good parts is a pro and shows it that 's i could write and have done so a better script for in case you read this stephen mail me i 'll give you a better script to do a better movie the only realistic part is the one where see part 
 problem child is one of the movies ever made it 's not the worst though some people will disagree with me on that but it 's not the best either it 's about a boy who comic havoc on a couple john who him this film is too silly and because i do n't buy for one second that a child could act as as the kid does in this film it 's and although i did several times throughout 
 a solid b like his delivery is in a time of over the top performances i liked the relationship between the father and son i liked the family dynamics the looks silly but it is a representation of the kid 's toy and the dead it 's an like see this is a psychological story not a slash up instant watch it and reflect on your inner child and what the movie might have to say to you and you 
 i first saw this movie N years ago and it was introduced by then disney chief and the real jim a month ago it came back on tv and this time i taped it since then i must 've watched it at least three is a wonderful feel good movie that is written and acted by everyone concerned it going for every in the book as well as all of the other is to see a movie where the kids 
 this has always been one of my movies and will always be over the last few years i have become a N 's N 's trying to collect all of the better ones that were made back then i love lots of things about them from how they could be to how technically correct some of them were the great and the sets get me going too it 's a when they some of these good old movies they nearly 
 i tend to get when hearing about 's reputation as a director too often he 's as a only out to shock and entire audiences with images of pure true his films contain more explicit and as your average mainstream american production but his films always are of wide range and the are do n't a is yet another story this film is a pure of the italian shock i easily to call this film a it 's an old-fashioned 
 the first episode immediately gave a good impression what to expect from the series waiting to be solved and a lot of good drama i love the fact that they gradually reveal the stories concerning the characters explaining just enough to stay excited of course this show has some flaws in the first two series there are some characters who for some reason do n't show up in the third season many of the characters have a decent sent off 
 as i watched one of ' last contributions to hollywood as a i knew i was watching a great movie though at times i did not know why the story in the lady from shanghai has the prime elements of a lead supporting characters and a if somewhat plot structure it is an entertaining ride and it 's filled to the with ' unique gifts as a director but there are scenes that tend to just not work or do 
 i always wanted to see in blue for a very long time i 've always been by the title the star and the desert but for some now pretty clear reason this film is never shown on tv or i 've happen to miss it if it 's ever shown well after watching the i now know why the movie is rarely shown it 's because it 's not that good in fact i 'd say it 's pretty much 
 i enjoy just as much as the next man but what the hell was that apparently shot over just three days using excess film stock left over from his previous film N ' this jean short is a produced on a budget that could n't have been much more than zero in the year N following a great war africa has become the most region on earth and what was formerly europe has been designated unknown land an african played 
 like watching a neighbor 's summer camp home movies indian summer is a sleep eight are barely introduced when boring begin for characters we know nothing about fine actors alan and bill are totally wasted in this film one 's that everything seems so much smaller than i remember it is repeated at least ten times enough to make you the anticipated are neither funny or original unless you think that short is a real this movie was a great 
 is a state of mind says the tag and i hesitate to comment on barry 's what could he have been thinking during the making of toys when he watched the did he see a successful funny fantasy if so then he 's working on a different plane than i. this is an picture one in which the production design is N of the thing and even the colors are a disappointment robin williams and most especially joan are as 
 by far this has to be one of the worst movies i 've ever seen in my life i watch practically every movie that is on at night either showtime hbo etc three island keeps you in as much as watching dry only to let you down even more if you want to feel like you just wasted what seems like an on the worst film ever created then by all means watch this movie i must have at a 
 i remember running home from school almost every day to catch 's channel N monster movies but never did i run home faster then when this movie was scheduled somehow the idea of being a boy and having a giant robot as a friend appealed to me in a very unique way sure i to be batman and other but i really wanted to be over any of them i have not seen this movie in N years and i 
 time for a i thought spirit was a great movie to watch however there were a few things that stop me from rating it higher than a N or N i 'm being a little bit generous with the N # N me i was thinking a voice they got for the main character ' when i first heard him and then i realized it is the man bugs me so very bad his performance in the was terrible and 
 in another role as the to a single mom in a N chicago neighborhood the veteran character actress gets another as a woman who wo n't let any defeat her spirit of success the children a boy and girl are drawn to their although the many magic and practical jokes learned from her and applied at all the wrong opportunities eventually get them expelled from plot is in the cuban missile crisis with all of the social implications men building 
 having read the critic 's review i went to a of radio not knowing what to expect the critic now appears to me anyway a frustrated film critic his review is and totally for this is a movie that will make you it will make you cry and in the end it will give you a moment of to a line delivered by actor ed harris in the final scene and all this time that we thought we were teaching 
 there is absolutely nothing in this movie that shows even the scrap of talent nobody in it has ever tried acting before even the in the coffee shop look as if they 've been in place nothing looks film quality is terrible most of the ' takes place in narrow or apartments with the in as an some camera and between ' as they deliver their lines no and no proper either there sound quality is terrible even ' fares 
 i was at the improvements made in an film if you sit close to the screen you will see the detail in the and surface structures the detail colors and are at least an order of magnitude better than toy story how they were able to pull off the i will never know i do hope that will provide a on how the film was produced so i can find out how all this was accomplished based on this film 
 though i did not begin to read the in literature until i was N it 's never too late is a favorite for many reasons mainly because there is n't a part of the book i liked less only parts i enjoyed more the N tv with and timothy was everything i hoped it would be i saw it as a full length movie in 's rochester ' was very good but i absolutely loved 's ' on another ' 
 ronald gives an performance as tony john a broadway actor who ca n't separate his life from shakespeare 's the character he plays on stage two important scenes illustrate tony 's dilemma the first one takes place in producer max 's office acting is a matter of talent for the but tony 's friend no no when you do it like tony does it it 's much more the way he has of becoming someone else every night so completely 
 some of the of this film were extremely generous with i personally was disappointed because due to those reviews i was optimistic as the opening credits began to familiar story line goes like this boy and his father live out in louisiana local boys and him local boys start 's oh sorry i mean victor 's on fire with him in it attempts to rescue his son formerly known as eddie meets the elephant man but puts a through the 
 this made for tv film is about every you can come up with for a disaster movie the only problem is it is n't very well brain is still from the scenes in which brian is supposedly looking at a computer monitor looking for weather pattern data and showing on that monitor are stock scenes of weather turmoil the weather channels commercials why would watching local news of a out give insight to global weather patterns you got through out 
 i have no idea as to which audience director george hoped to sell this with in the central role and enough and to carpet the entire norman plays like a picture combined with any number of silly episodes involving comic not to mention an by flowers based on a play by sam and ron clark this tale of an married couple and learning the hard way that their son is and living with a white homosexual has enough jokes to 
 no no no that is my advice to you if you are wanting to see this film anthony is the one and only norman bates as is in her role as crane this just seems like a version of with a few mildly different thrown in for a more modern appeal is as ill norman and 's sam seems too much the compared to the original please folks do yourself some justice do n't bother with this one can only 
 there are some elements that save this movie from being a total catastrophe but are with bad acting plot thrown stupid weak script and predictable what we have here is a movie with a that goes nowhere for most of the time a group of unlikely heroes including a black guy that gets it first that seems to be still very much alive even in finland seem to have trouble trying to exit a empty hospital there are ghosts very 
 i on here right after watching this movie feeling that it was so awful that at least its reviews might be entertaining but all you appear to kind of like it and so since i want the job done right from the opening shot the movie its for the audience 's attention span by showing an entirely picture of an irrelevant bridge for a long long time then it goes to some which is at least a little bit cool 
 first of all let me say that i am in no way denying the importance of the subject quite the opposite i am polish and i have been aware of the massacre for quite a long time in fact two of my family members died there so i was looking forward to this film unfortunately i was think the main problem lies with the script which too many and characters none of which are properly developed the characters are painfully 
 my wife and kids was and still is the best comedy series on tv ever really enjoyed it and everyone in the still watch the bros. should all somehow be featuring together in a comedy wife and kids was a comedy the whole family could watch and you do n't get that very n't there anything we can do to make it happen again we would do anything to have that comedy show on again N should make a come 
 one of the best theater directors this country ever had showed he was equally at home with movies with panic in the streets mr. gives us an early version of what would come later with perhaps his master piece on the although both movies share only the water setting for they are different about different shot on location in new orleans the by daniel of the and edward stories that are the basis of the film is remarkable in that 
 this movie is still alive and today thanks to the presence of alan this is good in one way because the movie has some interesting things to say but bad in another because everyone who watches it expecting that is going to through his usual is going to be mighty disappointed without fanfare or introduction is suddenly introduced in the third true his role is a key one but it 's small and likely to get lost in the there 
 days a serious comedy it 's desperate to teach us a lesson and it wo n't stop until we 've passed the final and take a trip to washington where they see the senate in action or if you prefer have a with their senator eugene in one of the worst roles of his career get with a of children and meet a man on a train reading a book by henry henry a year later he was considered a 
 first up this film according to the said it won best film at film festival in houston texas must have been a quiet n't call this the worst film ever but it certainly is pretty much just as terrible as other b body but at least that film did n't look like it was shot on N guess is the film makers watched a lot of films and really bad b grade films thinking that they too could crack into 
 apparently in the eyes of some there are n't enough films these days involving young people being across a desert by a in a truck i mean all we have so far is ride wolf creek monster man among others rest stop may very well be the worst out of those it is about a girl and her who leave their lives behind to start over together in california along the way they stop at a so the young lady 
 in any number of films you can find nicholas as a strong silent hero dennis as a as a and the late as the heavy these are the types of roles these four can play in their sleep and they have done so often enough that to see them playing them again borders on what a relief therefore that john a master at getting a lot of mood out of a little action directed this manages to keep from going 
 i am a professional who was inspired nearly N years ago to begin playing after hearing page on led ii while i do n't play in the same or style the impact of that man has been huge now nearly N years later i finally got to see something more than the the song remains the same again i have seen so many perform some small some the current ' no band no where no way has ever been able 
 this film is in no way entertainment but more of a look deep into the of the side of human linking a half a dozen stories of the worst kind of sex greed violence and all the action is played out over a few very hot and days during a in vienna and the heat is maybe responsible for some of the anger and hate in the film for me the treatment of the girl by the security equipment salesman 
 the location of the shop around the corner is precisely stated at the start of the film street in but it could really be in any place the small number of sets reflect a middle european design but it could be a shop around any corner the film is not about or the retail leather goods business but about the ups and of love reflected in most of the main and are partners at work but their letters to each

 let 's begin by acknowledging that there are three types of films good bad and utterly embarrassing that make the entire suffer in every way dark harvest promises big with its cover but rest assured that is where the show stops following a opening we soon discover that the film consists of a very poorly written script extremely under qualified even for a film acting lighting and even worse special effects seriously could no one afford anything more than a 
 ivory was so funny in low down shame that i had to see this one and it was one of the worst he has done and steven did n't help much it starts off with some odd killings that do n't make much sense to jim campbell keenan he is surprised to see a new partner waiting for him to work by his side to crack the case but jack does n't seem to be who everyone thinks he is 
 not too many people seem to know about this movie which is too bad because i think it 's pretty good sure it is a bit at times and may have a predictable but the presentation of the movie is pretty well done i think the casting is good with tom does a good job at playing a baseball player go figure not too much of a stretch i and ken from black rain plays the chief the coach of 
 the bradford N thin man series star william this film was released the same year as the second thin man film after the thin man comes very close to the fun and style of the thin man films but it nonetheless misses still it is a fun highly entertaining murder mystery in the same comic missed of course let 's not lie however i 'd be to name a better substitute than jean arthur and the chemistry between arthur and 
 i always believed that a film that 's plot is around a reality video game never sounds as though it 's going to be anything special but proved i could n't have been more wrong this film is and highly entertaining offers so much more than that from start to finish this film has you to the point where you can have so many ideas you can not make a final conclusion david has a talent for this as he 
 a of comedy a of a of if there is anything negative to say about a chinese ghost story it might be that the special effects looked dated in comparison to modern technology the film has a simple a poor debt has to stay in a area while trying to collect a debt of course it happens to be as i was n't expecting the first time i saw this film is that it 's one of the most love 
 boone had a monster hit with her recording of the pop song you light up my life the conn film of the same name however was a embarrassing conn plays the girl who is in love with michael who plays the guy they are engaged but every one knows that is n't going to any one that is n't and built so only is surprised when he her to say is quite she has been doing a little in her 
 with the dialogue in the dubbed version of this film i do n't think that shakespeare is in any great danger this is the story of an ancient who has been his stuff has been taken and this really him off he seems to know who 's doing this even though he 's a entity i loved the two men who tell the story of how the was found and the doctor who is determined to destroy the there are

 i wanted to like this movie but it falls apart in the middle the whole is a good one and ties up but the middle runs off the people i watched with were getting while it ran off course and hoping it would end sooner than it did another person actually fell during the middle segment i found myself day elsewhere during the parts that had nothing to do with the plot i bought it for the eye candy and 
 awful simply awful it proves my theory about star power this is supposed to be great tv because the guy who directed is the same guy who directed this about a b r i something a thousand times more interesting to do like watch your tv with no picture and no sound i rated it so high there are n't any negative scores in the rating system my theory about star power is the more star power used in a 
 whenever i hear a movie being touted because it has no sex violence bad language special effects and so on my goes off usually a movie like that is which to people who do n't want anything to surprise them but to how superior they are to us craven folk so when david lynch 's the straight story began getting those kinds of reviews i was especially since i was not a fan of his other story the elephant man 
 i was surprised after watching this piece of if you have seen an episode of tom and jerry in which jerry some liquid onto him and becomes than you are likely to see the same with added a man becoming and doing s i is the conclusion of the movie involving too much sex in a movie does n't increase its worth and most of all i was surprised when the same ending was used to show up the and

 it me how anyone can rate this film very highly it is no to call it far how the guy managed in such a short space of time to construct a wooden of underground rooms is quite ridiculous or maybe he was the greatest carpenter since the played by looked like a from the jerry show and i found the female lead rather plain we have an expression here in the u.k. done up as ' which suits her perfectly 
 with the normal films to watch this halloween that i 've seen over and over again i took a chance on the hoping it could get my flowing again mind you i had just come back from seeing the dark castle of the house on hill complete and the me away in a story about a model who moves into a building in brooklyn the film offered everything that i hope to find in a good movie N and characters 
 well this film has certainly had a fair amount of from the at the toronto film festival to reviews on radio a movie apparently i 'd been looking forward to it for can i put it this simply it in a very big way an exercise in that makes look like a comic best it was mildly amusing and at worst an script badly directed and into a what was with the music being than the rest of the sound 
 this movie was n't the best but it did have some good actors in it washington was pretty good as a homeless guy guy was good as his handicapped brother was as the and surprisingly the actress roman was good as the judge in the movie i did n't even know it was her and i am a die hard real world fan she was totally hopefully this movie wo n't these actors development i know that has left this 
 it is often hard to decide what the best film is that you 've ever seen since this may vary by preferences for or even the mood you 're in on a particular day having said that this movie is by far in my opinion the worst movie i 've ever seen i thought the acting was terrible was there any the plot was just and the were totally could a lower budget production be created without being an production 
 never had i seen such a powerful true story movie i discovered a city a country a lost revolution and even a nobel prize winner thanks to this of you have n't seen this movie you ca n't say you 've seen anything great lesson of and have n't seen anything as good saturday january N 
 this movie might be if not for all the language in it i think that the itself is n't bad but i would be too embarrassed to let my wife or kids see the movie i know that kids will learn all the words along the way eventually that 's true but parents should not assist them in the process by letting them see and hear the stuff in the of used to quite like robert he has a distinctive 
 the makers of this film have created a future where not only is abortion and birth control illegal in every state but women are prosecuted for murder and sent away to serve long prison other words this film is every liberals worst nightmare the political agenda is so here and the style of the film is so that it just loses steam pretty of which side of the you 're on i 'd recommend it 
 a somewhat typical bit of from this era obviously it was first into this world for the stage but nonetheless a very good film from beginning to end peter and york get to do their stage performance act for the silver screen and both do it effectively there is very little in the way of story and anyone not familiar with this type of off beat character study may be a little put off by it all in all though 
 this chinese set in N may ultimately amount to a familiar theme of an 's dream of peace through unification into and there 's nothing challenging about the film but it 's a compelling with and passion and and events told in vivid strokes even for those not drawn to such historical for their own it 's an for the eyes the scene the coup attempt of the is one of the most staggering of physical space and in memory 
 like most everyone who views this movie i did it for the stars michael and dennis the two are extremely and because of that have to headline a lot of in this film plays a guy who a and is offered help from the film actually is n't as terrible as it could have been i 've seen both in much worse both and working together horrible film the direction was pretty poor and the script needed a few but 
 the of the is a very good film that has a good cast which includes paul mark stevens francisco de la de and the acting by all of these actors is very good the is really cool he looks great and he sound like the character the there are some really scenes in this film the is really good and some of it is surprising the movie is very good the music is good the film is quite interesting and 
 film i saw this film at the N sydney and film festival and from start to finish the acting was but very funny i 'm not entirely certain about the real world influence we do n't get that here but the film holds up without the understanding of that show b every scene she appears in most notably when acting with her seldom red highly recommended i 'd love to see this released on some time in the future 
 for a while it seemed like this show was on then apparently there was a second season or some other kind of of this horrible show about the two most and people who have ever been all the other comments have captured the of these two perfectly not much less can be said about them besides what everyone else has doubt these two have and more than likely they made some kind of bargain in order to get their on 
 being a russian myself sometimes it 's hard for me to get the reference jokes about american tv or apart from that family guy is the and most politically incorrect shows seen on earth the voice acting is excellent and sounds clear enough even for a speaker as myself to are good too maybe even too good for a here we have the equivalent of the adult channel but nothing there simply compares to this not even or south park 
 alexander is held up as a it has however aged very badly people decide not to mention this and talk about the great and the great music the sound effects may have been good then but apart from the all the sounds are i may be shot by film for this but i 'm sure the modern of alexander will agree that the propaganda and the music to from the film i gave this film because it is a master

 my partner and i sat down to watch this film over a bottle of wine last saturday and although we initially had our reservations once the story got going it was in actual fact rather the scene in which one of the characters in murdered by was particularly and the work of korean new wave park chan the weapon of choice was a particular and allowed us to see into the of ' heavily the of a warm into a

 i went to this movie expecting an scary film what i got was scare after scare it 's a film at it 's core it 's not like other films where a house just has ghosts and this film does n't even show you the majority of the deaths it shows the fear of the characters i think one of the best things about the concept where it 's not just the house its whoever goes into the house they 
 i have seen this film on N different the first occasion i was over by this appeared as a very kind film to this film as a garbage on my second my third my belief that it is a good is a lot of emotional power in this film especially scenes of emotional confrontation between and are some scenes in which appears a person despite the fact that she is a beauty in real hoffman appears as a lost hero 
 i this every friday as part of it was on and consistently big time with each and every week if you want to see something funny go watch no on would tell and fred it really is shows exactly why no one ever goes on to a good film career after doing a terrible tv show this show really makes me sick i hate those kids and bob needs to go jump off a bridge for ever making this i 
 well it might be a kid 's movie perhaps but i 'm not let my kids from N watch it so the one who say it is a kid movie it is movie i agree so but back to the movie it is about a boy who can lie very good so good that at the end nobody truth or it is a nice movie to see nice screen play i vote a N for screen play and story i 
 the idea is to have something interesting happening in the first ten minutes to keep the audience late night shopping manages to avoid interest for much longer than that when we do get to a point it is so that i kept thinking i must have it but i tells the story of an osaka who the same apartment to two people at the same time who worked different shifts and so did n't they were sharing his friend asks 
 there 's only so much that i can take of filipino films especially where the trend is sex action and comedy which i hate the fact that man made me think and made me during the movie was a big plus it 's got good scenes and was great especially the i think that deserves the best actress here rather than getting one in the movie milan the fact that there 's only so few filipino movies that i really 
 i really tried to give this film a chance but when i realized that most of the film was being told by a bunch of boring officials walking around and talking on phones i knew it was over a lot of this film also looked like stock that 's just camera person kept like doing these quick short for no reason it bothered me so much but i was just wondering why in the did they think it was a 
 as a bruce campbell fan for nearly two decades i was to have an opportunity to see his latest film on the big screen with the man himself in attendance unfortunately man with the brain was itself a in where the channel makes its saturday night original films man with the brain is a mix of comedy violent and with a touch of romantic reconciliation if that does n't make sense well neither does man with the brain campbell plays 
 it 's one of those that 's so bad that it almost hits the point of being very funny the script is absolutely dire direction lighting the only thing letting it down from a true so bad it 's good feel is that the sound design is only quite bad it adds no to the story although trying hard but does n't at least destroy any there 's problems of seasons of out door shots throughout and finally last but 
 victor as the surely somebody must have been drunk when that casting decision was made that 's not the worst part of this silly of house devices but it gets my vote for being the part of it while the film is by no means terrible it does n't even approach other N 's house like the and the of hell house the evil can be entertaining in spots but do n't expect to be scared it 's better approached 
 when i first picked this film up i was at the basic idea and eager to see what would happen i 'm a fan of and love it when it 's successfully merged with live action however the in this film was about all i enjoyed although it must be said that the actors ' performances were excellent the look including the gave a air to the piece however this was quality of was lost the both and in the

 the is by most highly director nelson mccormick has brought us the second best movie of all time rated lower than side out and higher than well however do n't let the cover of this movie you kill shot stars up and coming star as a modern day holmes using such high-tech as a computer that is less powerful than my is able to aid fbi agents in the tracking of a man who has not committed any obvious crime 
 man this movies it appeared to have like seven different going on at once and they all made little to no sense the special effects and all that stuff were beyond awful the acting was bad everything seemed so forced especially the lines from the woman with the huge eyes and the little kid his as he gets is so it 's a good portion of this movie is rather funny anyway the one woman 's death where she a 
 one of the of picking up the recent collection is getting to see movies like the ray and team up in a movie that into and radiation and while the science is all perfectly absurd especially the camera technique as uses to determine the site of a certain and downright i did n't care in the lease because the movie is the effects are done well for the time the acting is great and the finish is particularly strong it

 i 've heard people who say this movie is i do n't think they were watching the right movie this is n't the action movie is a psychological drama about the and his that just happens to be about killing people in this way it works extremely well with performances from and who does n't through the movie like he has in other roles he actually looks like he 's acting was disappointed with the action the end a lot 
 i think this film has been somewhat here there are some things to in it for one thing it deserves credit for being a science film which relies on its story instead of special effects and action to carry the day the supporting cast is good the set design and are good and the ideas are interesting enough though they are beginning to seem a little tired after the many dark city fight club of recent years but the film 
 the best batman movie of the N 's no doubt about it this movie takes place in a city filled with and the are somewhat they fit perfect for the movie 's tone of but the performances are really great and the comic tone behind them really expectations do n't get by the this is a movie in the pure style of burton that ca n't be described burton is a director that took the batman franchise to another level 
 i 'm among millions who consider themselves grant fans but i ca n't think of a single reason to recommend this do n't understand the casting of and it appears no one else did if we 're to judge from the small number of films in which she played fans will agree that was at chasing and catching grant in bringing up the director or writers try to the idea but it fails 've read comments about how was but 
 i was in such high hopes of seeing an of a classic story like the nights instead i was disappointed in a film that failed to keep my attention from the very beginning even though i tried watching it twice it was a bonus that was in this movie but it did n't amount to much as the actors lacked for something a little similar with anthony hopkins and is much better for action comic moments and overall so son 
 if you see this turkey listed in your tv guide avoid it like the a great pile of does n't begin to describe how bad this movie is there is only one funny scene the memory scene but even that rates only on the out of N whoever wrote this turkey should be banned from writing another movie for their entire lives 
 because that is the only way you wo n't think this film is a total waste of time and money a of can wait which was at least worth watching is a poor excuse for a romantic comedy it is more a vehicle to give rock some time on film for weak stand up comedy which does n't play well on the big screen especially because his jokes generally are supposed to be from the body of an old fat

 in the early N 's production companies had a short-lived craze for movies in france after the and of the wolf turned out to be hits so several movies were or saved from their fate however france as opposed to the us or italy has little tradition of fantasy and it turned out quickly that bloody or the were attempts at a kind of magic that had never existed in french in the first place as they producers have gone 
 i think that the idea of the plot is perfect for exploring first of all the emotional of the people involved and second as someone else wrote in a comment the implications of this kind of relationships incest and in the to begin with the second aspect to make it short it was n't visible at all as for the first as i said it had much more potential i think that those kind of relationships carry much more tension 
 this is the worst show i have seen in years i believe that it should be taken off of because of its it is so i could when i watch it even though i never watch it because it is poor when mac says he can eat sugar in another episode he sugar almost everything in the world has sugar in it in episode eddie monster when at he falls into the twice plus the time he falls in he 
 this movie has a big production feel that i was not expecting from an independent film the characters are each developed and dealt with in a way that not only helps to tell the story but left me with a satisfied experience 
 so van wanted to in color so that he could bring it into modern audiences who would probably go into arrest if they were ever forced to see a movie in black & white while they forget that both and 's list were in black & white and are great the same people who would n't want to see a great movie just because it 's in black & white are the same people who would n't like anyway because 
 god this has not been renewed by series while popular god knows why has a very simple i 've found another body behind the they are working for the time this series ' plot the dialogue is so simple it 's as though this has been written for children talking down to the and explaining every plot just ' to be around when someone does something out the ordinary and time they look into and investigate someone 's murder they 
 do n't mistake war inc. for a sharply or a comedy full of inside jokes for news it is an old-fashioned comedy with plot stock characters given some in fun performances by john joan and duff and a approach to the political see the ' political points are things nearly all of the country already knows are true we understand that the corporations off the war are corrupt pigs the political leaders in charge of it are even more and 
 very rarely it happens that i sit down to write a comment for a movie but this movie oh my god never ever was there a movie better than this and never ever there came a movie better than this it 's the king of all khan is the best comic actor in indian film industry though its funny to say that because he is a class act not a but what he has done in this film is perhaps 
 i have n't watched a movie this awful in a long while maybe not since new guy ' or various freddie jr. movies yes it is that awful 's blank and wooden acting surely must 've been inspired by freddie the movie staging was like a play rather and that feeling of does not work well on film the actors had no idea what they were doing especially her was awful and her sex appeal here so it was painful 
 this movie is a great the plot is very true to the book which is a classic written by mark the movie starts of with a scene where a song with a bunch of kids called when you your on the moon it me of 's song high hopes it is fun and the music is great throughout and my favorite song is sung by the king and sir overall a great family movie or even a great date movie

 this is how i feel about the started watching the show in reruns in enjoy the show but it had too many hate the & characters stealing story lines from old tv shows they even from the family then in N episode the family was playing different roles in different episodes the most notable doing this especially when she played herself in N character could not take a joke but then they had this little kid act out to her 
 this is a film notable for what is not shown as much as for what is what is shown is the incredible poverty in as the century gave way to the a life style that made people dream of the ' world of america the mancuso family live in a place that is not even a just a stone set amid the harsh stones of a country that can not offer even a single of green an opening sees the

 maria does n't seem to care what people think of her choices in movie roles again she chooses a very difficult and not popular movie to star in maybe she needs those movies to get off the sugar coated hollywood ones she does here and then and of course N i think fails to achieve what it sets out to do i wo n't that maria is as great as in her other movies she stars in it 's her 
 this film is about british of war from the world war ii from a camp in find the wooden horse boring the subject could have been and but the wooden horse is told in a very plain way it 's a collection of plain and poorly told events with no suspension and the first half tells how the of war a tunnel but the events are so plain with not enough and close to make me on edge the latter

 i am glad to see most other people here do n't think much of this movie either it has some big names in the cast but that 's it there is nothing else to recommend save a few pretty women which you can do in a thousand story involves nothing but characters that national film critics all seem to like and most of the public ca n't stand the oklahoma are so fake they are the southern are right from 
 for a film with so much promise it was disappointing and the acting ranging between and plot had more in it than swiss and it 's the worst ending i 've seen in a movie for some time the final scene would have my heart out if the entire movie had n't been so painful to begin with i was from the very first scene one was left wondering if the sister was trying to reach out to her for

 go in the utah only to run into a the is a pretty run of the mill film that mostly from a lack of the victim characters are which means one does n't really care about them we just wonder when they will die not to mention it has one too many moments and is with endless unnecessary nature however it does have a few moments of interest to fans the touch of atmosphere and a decent music score by

 shop around the corner N ' is a romantic comedy not the sort that i will hold to me until the end of my days but nonetheless a film of its reputation by N director ernst had long ago taken hollywood by storm and his touch had become a commercial trademark this film was planned for a N release but scheduling conflicts meant that james stewart and margaret were unavailable for rather than either of his main stars decided to

 i knew that i was not about to see a quality film when this title was included in a ' video night ' at a friends place despite the warnings i was still surprised at just how bad this film was it was that there were a lot of us there to share the pain with each other the film attempts to tell the story of a dark future one in which a mad max type of character heads off 
 all through his career did great films this was not one of man knows too much his daughter is to secure his and in the all is resolved to the of and who has seen lang 'm ' comes to will know how far this urban of crime and falls short of what had already been done in that at that time there is an altogether air about much of the staging and acting which any sense of and that 
 why do they insist on making of great movies like high noon from here to and this one why do they think that color is more to a than stark black and white why did robert 's insist on wearing that baseball cap it made him look like jim would anyone spend four hours suffering through this watch the original then you wo n't have to ask yourself why 
 typical has been done many times before simple plot becomes with russell 's wife and he tries to off good ' kurt so he can have her this is beyond predictable it does n't even try to make you guess the plot is the plot and there 's no thinking outside the box here i guess then the only reason to watch it is to see how it develops but nothing is done originally or there 's not really anything 
 i live in mexico city so i have to suffer the for every piece of trash that comes out from all these stupid mexican you want to a mexican guy for making great films take a look at something by del specially the 's or maybe though i really do n't like his films but i respect them often produce some of the most terrible trash ever la el american visa but this is one of the lowest points in 
 although the wonderful soda counter in the local exists and the clothes are definitely vintage and good and evil are easy to understand old planes are really dated this movie will never be dated the human adjustments and problems the stories the wonderful acting especially harold russell are as moving today in N as they were in i was one of the young women who welcomed our home from world war ii like so many my memories war years and 
 a really bad part N had a lot of funny moments part N is just bad in a boring way and obviously made to squeeze money out of the on you the only slightly amusing moment in the film is who apparently seems to be ed about the other characters it 's quite easy to identify with him the is the director should do everyone a favor and quit his job immediately the acting is worse than a grade school 
 most families will between their own family and that created through brilliant acting by and susan creates an on screen image that justifies her as one of the best in america and one worthy of a golden globe nomination the control of her are so in that at any point in the movie she can tap into them and release an scene susan is also amazing in this movie as yet again she chose a role that is so different 
 truly bad and easily the worst episode i have ever seen tried to make up for it by giving it the know we are doing this ' routine that would have been funny if it were n't for the fact that ' had already done it and it still would n't make up for it if they had come up with the idea in the first took place as part of the usual character 's mainly 's the were n't 
 i finally saw and i have to say that i equally enjoyed it and was by it what 's great about it is the atmosphere the music the location the and the beautiful cast the story is for sure but with these movies it does n't really matter the pace in and the are exotic the film has a lot going for it unfortunately it also has a few things going against it the first thing is that the and 
 the make of a love story for me is whether or not i like the characters and also if they with each other is pretty seemingly and a he 's been hurt badly by his mom and this makes him a little easier to take i guess i liked the details of his he was he by that he ' he acts so cool around that he strikes out twice when they do talk he ca n't show her who 
 this movie starts out with an execution of a of and his his head is off and buried separately of his body sounds like the thing that would n't die does n't it well it does play out a little like that but once the body is with the head all the interesting and deaths are done and the movie moves very slowly i mean the movie is only N minutes long and i kept thinking when is it going 
 i first saw this movie when i was about N years old unfortunately i could not watch it to the end because it was aired late at night now i bought it on because i can remember that i liked is really not an ordinary movie it has some elements but i rather it as fantasy i liked it but i hoped for a bit more and scary scenes especially the scene when 's comes into the trying to kill 
 as she is transformed from a to an potential most N films have a edge to them the camera work is pretty sluggish at times but we must these for their as a guest of the with an odd of types including her husband the dialogue is fun and the performances on and the most even shows off her piano expertise in a musical her strange yet appealing and affair with the camera are evident throughout and she hits every 
 like a lot of people i loved the original american was one of the great movies of the the more american is a horrible mess of a movie it was n't funny the characters had become and and the stories were such as 's character having another brother because richard did n't do the and terry the and joe somehow managing to serve together in vietnam they even have a police officer by the name of harrison ford 's character 
 a complex story laid on the background of of an honest who an innocent girl and an educated who burns the harvest of a man yet in the end you end up them both the story is powerful yet the and flow are background music score and the are outstanding next comes acting by veteran photography the time the violence and flavor of rural very well others actors either did not act well or did not get a chance to 
 seeing this film brought back to me memories of the first thing i remember of that morning was seeing tv pictures of an flying into a large building and my immediate thoughts must be a for a new tom film was not a tom film this was certainly not a british version of the sum of all fears the typical tom film or novel has a relatively small cast a linear plot and usually some sort of resolution this film 
 i it 's nice and trendy to see wonderful things in the of a film like this with the sometimes excesses of many hollywood films we can relax and enjoy a scene of explosions language and has its place and can be very effective when employed properly however this film is not one of those the long scenes with no dialogue and i 'm sure that they must hold some great meaning and insight because the implied message in in 
 this is far more than the story of man the of although it is that as well it 's the tale of one person learning to love life again pushing past all the pressures of work and money to discover once more the bonus in this film is a insight into the slowly changing attitudes of modern japan toward everything from to physical contact there are scenes that will make you out loud a few where you 'll want to 
 the true measure of any piece of work is whether or not the characters grow from their and emerge from the experience altered in some significant way note that this change need not be positive or beneficial at the that measure april is a success as a film in general it succeeds quite cast characters you come to care about wonderful script and beautiful sets and locations in short the film is well although all the performances are three must 
 i just one of the greatest and i 'm not talking about the death of the great this film i 'm sorry to say was terrible absolutely terrible a true tragedy in history well maybe i 'm being a little harsh but unless you have some interest in the life of then do n't even consider coming near this one and those that do have an interest in his life will find that most parts were and made out to 
 this is one of the shows i have ever seen it is really to watch and i was in many times i guess there is a social awareness factor to this too which makes it quite interesting if these were white would they get the same reaction maybe they would maybe they would n't the characters know no limits check my and do not exclude anyone from their sense of fun there are so many funny my is the bob 
 the movie had an interesting surprise somewhat and the makers could have ended it without making it just another of a rash of movies put out by hollywood promoting other sexual this could have ended with a but there were other behind the what me off is that the in your face after you 've seen the whole movie like the disappointing the mr. sure i 'm just another this content the whole film i would n't judge a movie 
 this movie is truly one of the worst pieces of garbage ever it really is surprising that something so completely terrible could be made but if you can stand the plot character development and direction you may get a kick out of the which is so that it is funny the movie begins and quickly becomes someone should give anyone involved with this movie some sort of because their career was probably because of involvement in this movie if you 
 we have to remember that the N 's were practically a blank slate when it came to movies hollywood was in transition from war movies two etc to movies with a message we had on the and so on some folks might think that was an improvement i do n't who was the who said if you want to send a message call western union he was right these psychological are less entertainment than some kind of one is a

 the first movie was with incredible character development and action scenes that kept with the flow of the story these elements coupled by incredible special effects of the day presented a ride that kept you in the entire time enter and its the problem here is n't the special effects or the fight as some may argue the brothers have taken characters from the first film and them out like tree the connection that was first established between viewers and

 i really do not have any clue as to why some people find the power television show even interesting at all the are completely ridiculous and the people playing in them also look completely at the same time there is absolutely anything interesting about the power this is just a higher priced television commercial designed to sell extremely plastic garbage to the children around the world from the notes i can see that it 's been banned in the country

 ii is one of those pictures which makes you ask ' as in was it funded ' was it made ' and was it released into the public say the least it 's a bad film it serves little purpose but to how superior its was by setting an almost identical set of characters against each other in a similar as a money ' land developer attempts to buy out the establishment 's golf course right off the bat making

 this movie was a complete disaster for me there is one thing that movies must have in order to be and that is some psychological credibility of characters unfortunately here this is not the case the main characters most of the time and even if they have some reason for such behavior it is not revealed to us by the director 's character is particularly making pictures of everything throughout the whole movie when one could expect something more rational

 the most part this movie feels like a effort the direction is the acting with the exception of fred is and particularly her lines like she 's cold reading them off a card only one thing makes this film worth watching and that is once comes back from the there is something disturbing about watching a small child murder someone and this movie might be more than some can handle just for that reason it is absolutely this film only 
 for a moment let 's put aside the cultural aspects of this movie even if it is a very important side of it and let 's look at the simple fact that this is a very nice love story two individuals find themselves in a difficult situation caused by two they have to live through their sad days without any ray of hope if each one of these two women had been alone imagine what kind of life each one

 i have a piece of advice for the people who made this movie too if you 're make a movie like this be sure you got the to back it up also do n't get a bunch of z list actors to play in it another thing just about all of us have seen park so do n't copy it all in all this movie acting story let 's talk about the acting for just a second the guy who

 yet another recent comedy that shows that hollywood ca n't even do the when it comes to that it used to do in its sleep for decades if the had any brains they would have based the film around 's character of boss jack taylor when he 's in the film early on it 's nothing special but it is mildly promising and occasionally amusing once he for the majority of the film and has his ' with guest after 
 i just can not believe the low scores for this movie probable reason has to do with the low number of votes meaning few people have seen it this is simply a movie there are so many stories within but it 's not complicated each character grows with the movie and we experience with them life changes the is simply amazing and the end credits are the best ever in any movie i have seen just like a shakespeare play 
 this is a movie with a wonderful concept but very weak writing it should never have been released with out at least three more assuming it got any the story is too held together and there are too many N degree turns in the story to make it a movie it would be great to see what a decent could do with the story

 this movie was very disappointing in that several elements of the book were done the main story is the same but there are several flaws that hurt the miles gets injured in the beginning of the story in a game at texas this means he wo n't get anything done during the season at all and chris comes up sooner on the the game against marshall was lost at marshall the team as marshall was actually midland high one of 
 i think the cards were against because right from the start there was this feeling like something was wrong but i could n't quite put my finger on it then it hit me dubbed for a little while they managed most of the lines either as voice over or off screen with just a little hint here and there until it became painfully obvious this is the kind of that on the nerves with nothing even funny about it i 
 this movie is just plain silly almost every scene has some bit of humor running and great jokes the acting is n't that great and the plot is but the jokes more than make up for that if you have a chance to see this movie i recommend that you do 
 the basic idea behind of is n't all bad the acting however is bad the lighting is bad the music is bad the scenes of are without there really is n't much there to recommend this film you know what kind of a movie you 're in for when the credits say special guest star and list someone you 've never heard of might as well say hamilton as lincoln because there 's really no one in this movie you

 i watched this movie for the first time a few weeks ago and it was quite possibly one of the most boring films i ever had the of seeing first of all is a terrible actor and most of the movie on top of that the plot is just way too silly the only reason a into this film was because of baldwin and his character was eliminated pretty quickly unless you are a fan of you should probably avoid

 what i enjoyed most in this film was the of being i my country and i liked the director 's point of view based on a true story during the years when greece was struggling to stand on her own two feet through war and an italian and a girl fall in love but the times are hard and they have a lot of to make nicholas looking great in a uniform gives a account of this in the beginning 
 is a great movie with a great story about a great man general douglas this is of course the story of one of america 's great military figures and a figure made familiar to me from the earliest moments of my memory though there is a issue there may be others 's speech portrayed in the film as his N address to the u.s. military academy on accepting the award did not contain the phrase old soldiers never die they 
 what can i say i ignored the reviews and went to see it myself damn the reviews were so right what a waste of money considering it 's thing i went to see kill bill after this see a really scary movie would be bottom line i like girl in gold better than this 
 a pretty attempt to cash out of the thriving british club scene is a film that shows promise in certain departments but does very little else a plot which is there merely to string the club together acting and a pretty script all stop from being the that director obviously although is sometimes over especially when using the often dance music he does show potential and the lack of an drugs message is overall however the film is a wasted 
 even though the book was n't strictly accurate to the real situation it described it still carried a sense of japan i find it hard to believe that anyone who was involved in making this film had ever been to japan as it did n't feel japanese in the almost everything about it was terrible i will admit the actors were generally quite good but could n't stand a chance of saving it before the film started i was surprised 
 i read all the reviews here after watching this piece of garbage and it took me at least N pages to find out that somebody else did n't think that this was n't the of in the or indeed in any other era if this is n't the least funny set of comedy i 've ever seen it 'll do till it comes along half of the had already been done and better by acts such as and allen if 
 this movie attempted to make 's life interesting by being creative what they is that his life was plenty entertaining enough on it 's own without having to make things short list of the N was not sent straight to las vegas for a gin to pay off old debts he spent a good deal of time in florida first and only went to las vegas when he ran out of gin games on the east never associated or played 
 i like movies about which is why i recently decided to eyes behind the stars after seeing it when i was a kid back in the late and now i 'm to write a review about it because i 'm afraid i 'll start everything about it fast you see even though ai n't bad it 's very and the story is interesting but flat the actors are good but their roles are boring and a little confusing the are 
 this film should have been much better than it was christopher is an excellent actor but even he could n't rescue this tale of a young woman searching for the truth over her sister 's death warning in effect the truth is that the older sister played by is just a and girl who took too many drugs not much of a twist and not that interesting either the film is also with far too many and voice and lacks 
 this movie is one of the and most accurate of the mentality that seems to have the yet again N years after the time all the usual characters and conflicts are presented with such anger and love combined that it is impossible to decide whether or laughing would be the more appropriate response the of portrayal and the of the types however make it for a great film to watch if one wants to understand a little bit of what 
 anyone who had never seen anything like the fight scenes in the has never seen this movie the fight scenes were by action scene woo who also did the fights in the and the fight scenes are plays a who feels no pain who now lives a life as a got me when other evil begin killing off local drug to take over the drug trade teams up with his buddy to help stop are some absolutely crazy things going 
 this early N 's life as a i must say that valley girl along with fast times high stands out as the class of the sex the characters are accurate representatives of the era mall rebels are have seen this over ten times now the music in the film was unfortunately these could were never as popular era as those by arena like before the existed i searched out tapes it was the N 's after all of cotton and 
 i like steven but i have not a clue what this movie was about i am not easily lost with movies but i had no idea who was on who 's some of his future movies will be a little better my wife still thinks he looks good in black jeans however 
 a from start to you do n't like the then i just have to feel sorry for you this film does n't simply cash in on the ' popularity it 's a and film in its own right it 's got great and it has that of that was always present in jim 's and which is most in the character of the i always responded to this as a kid and it 's what makes the still to me 
 proves that waters has no intention of changing his ways in his old age a lot of things have changed since waters started making films in the but N years later he is still doing what he wants to do over the years the budget of waters ' films has increased considerably this is one of his most recent productions but i was to see that waters still has that touch edward plays a kid who is with photography he 
 house calls is a wonderful romantic comedy that can best be described as how they used to make them it stars walter in one of his best roles as a recently doctor who goes out on the dating scene again and hits as he seems to have a different woman every night he then meets hospital patient jackson and soon develops a relationship with her but it 's one that will be severely tested as she him she is a 
 after playing a in written on the wind finally said to her sweet roles and demonstrated an ability to play with the best of them she and played the same sort of and for her efforts here in a very role won a best supporting actress film she 's in is not quite up to standards but it is a strong enough under douglas 's capable hands there 's an almost look to the explosive opening scene and it sets 
 when watching a 's life for the first time in a long while i could n't help but see the comparisons with last year 's happy feet as far as the main goes they are very similar an doing what he can to fit in while also attempting to be special it just goes to show you how much better that film could have been without its liberal conclusion a lot of people disagree with me when i say that 
 what can i say of island is the story is good and solid but silly the jokes are the are you could n't ask for more in an game the you do n't need to see my bit is in itself well worth buying the game for not to mention murray who has become the hot topic among many of my friends only some of whom have played the game you will love this game and if you do n't 
 jim morgan freeman i was really quite skeptical the first time i watched this movie i mean what a conceptual nightmare jim playing god nothing is this movie is hardly but it also is not at least not to any great extent yes jim has the powers of god for a while but he is not god confused i 'll give you the low plays bruce a reporter who is down on his luck and feeling very unsuccessful with his 
 this film might have weak production values but that is also what makes it so good the special effects are gross out and well done my favorite part of the movie had to be played by brady she is hot and also has a good scene robert as the leader of the gang is as are the other members this film is actually trying to make a point by saying that nuclear waste plants are bad fair comedy gross out 
 coming from i probably should n't say it but i find a lot of the local movies lacking that flow with a weak this comedy lacks in nothing great story no no just brilliant comedy as we know can do it do yourself a and till you drop 
 this is one of the most bad films i 've ever seen i can not believe whoever wrote the review above was serious perhaps he was connected with making it it does n't have anything going for it there is no the acting is dire the direction the music score is three notes played ad the plot must have taken all of five minutes to write the dialogue is what a would come up with if asked to do a 
 i have always been a fan of bottom as many as i could find of the series here in the states the chemistry between and is always and the combination of smart writing and utterly stupid humor seems to work without fail i thus sat down to watch this movie with great eagerness and was utterly disappointed by the first of the movie can best be described as and poorly directed sorry but with some utterly brilliant moments unfortunately these 
 poor whoever she was not only was she according to this movie a upper east side she was a bad wife bad mother awful business partner plus there is no evidence in this picture that she was any kind of an artist except in the bold statement in the who is more attractive today than N years ago and actually looks younger indeed gives an excellent performance but what can an actress do with a wife and mom who seeks 
 this movie was bad beyond belief i saw it during the N san francisco film festival before it started the owner of the theatre got up and told us how half the audience had left the theatre the night before which happened to be its world premiere i do n't think anyone in the theatre understood just how bad the movie was going to be at that point we all understood by the end its not a though it was 
 so many bad it made me wonder what people are thinking while watching a simple made by a quite bad director did you all expected a movie no way you already can see movies all of his earlier works where but no one was take the first for instance so many flaws but still good fun sticking to the movie the movie is a fantasy film about a who can take any form which takes for the of its on 
 this was the first i 'd seen apart from return of and i thought before watching it that it would be close to the original i was was basically the first script with a few extra characters and the situation turned around and eric have a daughter who is n't satisfied with life on land she wants to become a however has kept her past from her daughter because she wants to protect when finds out she 's upset and 
 if anyone has any doubts about the talent of just a look at his new film everything is which clearly shows a man that is not only one of america 's actors but a new director whose first effort is indeed an and a of what is to follow mr. has adapted the novel by jonathan into a film that will live forever because of the way the director has adapted the material the film clearly our expectations since we 
 i viewed linda and it is a movie the lives of paul and his wife linda who he as a young man and finally married they meet another married couple jeff and and the become very good friends but their friendship takes a turn after together at beach a twist that never returns the married couples to their former status as is a the acting by virginia is acceptable however richard thomas the movie with his incredible acting and the 
 this is just a short comment but i onto this movie by chance and i loved it the acting is great the story is simple and and the lines especially from the are so and sad seek it out 
 how strange the human mind is this center of activity perceptions of reality are formed and and in which one 's view of the world on the of the brain this most delicate and of all things and how much do we really know of it 's of it 's or capacity what is it in the mind that allows us to between reality and a dream or can we perhaps our sense of reality is no more than an 
 this is one of the movies that get better every time you see them it 's packed with so many original and ideas that you always find a new detail as in 's subsequent movies i did n't see yet but the other ones are as great failure chance and play great roles the cutting and is and artistic without the movie being an art picture but a highly entertaining one when it to run run you have to keep 
 this is a very film with excellent actors and a range of it contains some really excellent which the whole family can enjoy you get to know the characters quickly and experience their ups and and it ends very upbeat 
 never having seen this movie based on the entertaining novel by nicholas and taking into consideration the first rate cast assembled for the production we decided to take a look just cause while not a horrible film takes too many with the original material that stuart did n't quite succeed in his treatment first thing we think when a young black man is to the local for is police after all brown and police officer show no in beating bobby 
 i really wanted to like this film the second film in the series had this silly drive in movie feel to it that was fun of course i was also drunk i watched this film with the highest expectation of a similar experience of high mystery science theater i was wrong this movie is a god awful waste of film and i liked the second one from the with the david to the female with that could strip the off 
 the sad thing about is that once you watch three or four episodes of it you really begin to understand that it is not far away from what happens in real life what is really sad is that it also makes extremely team in series one consists of brian thompson bruno lawrence a man who truly lives and dies merely by the ratings his show gets occasionally his to achieve these ratings see him run in with his line producer 
 as with most of ben 's movies the comedy is dry and story is predictable that is if you want to call this a story many points were left connected with no thought at all i want to the director for not explaining the points better i say that because that would mean the would have lasted longer as for any of ben 's failures this one is no exception and is only by the other actors even then the 
 alert i love tim roth i really do and he does his best with an role i can see how this is a movie that might look good as a script but it 's unlikely and ultimately silly i saw the fake death ending coming a mile away tries hard with an underwritten part and so does the whose name i ca n't remember the one that 's not chris penn is a big over actor see it if you 
 the only reason i give this movie an N out of N is because there are few movies in my opinion that are perfect this little b picture is a story well told i 've always been by alexander but have seen him very few movies here he plays a sad little man who turns into a monster he everything and everybody without an ounce of the performance is one of the most performances i 've ever seen since world 
 the biggest national hit remains animal house and so it was funny and exact opposite of every other national film including class do not be by the of stephen from animal house or by the fact that john hughes wrote this mess this is about as as root and twice as star and that 's being generous then again i always thought most of my old were and serial too

 my mother forced me to watch this movie with her she apparently will watch anything with a counsel in it i was different points rise of the is of battle for the planet of the the passion of the and what it me most of are those italian and pictures of the not the good ones that spend an amount of time showing or roman in talking and while you wait for the muscle man hero and his usually the 
 always enjoy the great acting of drew and her great performance in this film where she plays a very very complicated young parts N who leaves new york and to california and shares an apartment with a up and coming writer george patrick far harbor many strange things start to happen to and she seeks to find her brother in a mental institution after he killed her father if you look close enough you will actually see the mother of 
 i actually paid to see this movie in the would get a but the fight scenes between the robots are and there 's a realize that some movies have larger budgets than others i do n't have a problem with that unfortunately science movies probably suffer the most on a small budget for obvious reasons but one way this movie fails is that just about every piece of each set looked and cheap i mean could n't they even make 
 i bought this movie for $ N at a used cd store and i regret it i 'll start by saying i 'm a huge fan of they provide a cheap entertainment this movie for the first half hour because it was so bad it could be made fun of in an style manner quite easily then it got acting is the part of the movie while great acting is not to be expected this was bad and provided all

 the original movie was made in N with march a very good film indeed hollywood 's love of brings us a fairly interesting movie he of course was brilliant as he almost always seemed to be in all of his movies as andrew jackson was a of however the movie did tend to get a little long in places it does not move at the pace of the N version still it is a fun movie that should be seen 
 as arthur moore is perfect as a grown man trapped in as it turned out the role fit moore so perfectly it trapped him as an actor as well many disappointments soon followed including this film 's pale yet that does n't the or appeal of this picture which is written and directed some of moore 's drunk scenes are forced parts of the film are but the cast with so much it 's a difficult movie to resist it 
 this is a great movie if viewed in the proper context it was meant to be a of movies and the saw plenty of them i saw this movie when it first came out and instantly liked it being a big fan of it was great to see gene in the movie and anything with as a ca n't be all bad also was already a favorite of mine so it was great to hear them on the original this 
 and von in a small role are all brilliant in their performances is particularly at this sort of role where he must a character whose is at first uncertain to the audience as is so often the case with 's characters we must ask is he a in this case a minor one or a hero this is a disturbing story told about the and fearful bureaucracy in the old soviet union that the efforts of extremely competent people as 
 this is the kind of movie that my enemies content i watch all the time but it 's not bloody true i only watch it once in a while to make sure that it 's as bad as i first thought it kind of a boeing that at least is an improvement over having boeing a good part of the pentagon the goes down in the and to the a kind of has one of those the stars either falling 
 b. kennedy tried to make a by and leftist western not as leftist as the g. kennedy that came after this one is the film of the two looking it is b. kennedy made it without having the for that hundreds of hundreds of mexican hundreds of women a desert a largest in this only in a weird way is movie itself is very looking who made the best part in the first film does n't look good at all 
 gray can make the english language jump through like none other he a number of events tied together by his writing of a the monster of the title some sad some funny all in his characteristic manner if you liked to cambodia you will love this one i actually thought this was a bit more interesting and better told than to cambodia a real 
 i really loved this movie and have spent several years trying to get it it is just not available and it has not been on tv for many many years i enjoyed it and the because it had something different to say and made you think how every person looks at something from different also we often do n't appreciate something we have till it is no longer N year old daughter just the music and is with some of 
 we had free weekend and i switched on the station to see what was on it was this movie ii the acting was terrible but the eye candy was great and brown as the mentioned eye candy i was laughing a lot from the few scenes i friends wonder why i never want to go to movies if they saw this film they would know why i would get thrown out for laughing so a couple of notes brown who 
 this is one of the most bad movies i have ever had the privilege to watched this on with a bunch of friends one friday night and we just could n't stop laughing from start to story is simple enough a they think is carrying weapons grade but it 's actually carrying a bunch of easy mistake to make a incompetent team of army special forces to tackle the they are led by played by scott a man who seems 
 i 'm i must admit i never saw a movie with such good story and none stop high special effect art fighting scene if you like the like me you will certainly be more than satisfied all character have very cool power and the special effect are near in one word i will listen to this movie a lot in the next years 
 nowhere near the original it 's quite accurate copy bringing nothing new to the story but the is very poor is weak without good baldwin is simply just a second league compared to i watched it just out of being a huge fan of 's and i got what i thought almost a b movie with second rate acting and i was n't even disappointed i just do n't know what they were trying to do this does n't try 
 this was a classic case of something that should never have been was now a single mother her husband had left her because she would n't live in some with him he was mad that reagan had been elected and wanted to turn his back on society right then and there i had problems with the series come on i say to myself is this the same noble michael that 's right the series went on but it just did 
 maybe i identify with this film cause i live in and suffer from bad but whatever it is i must the on a most amazing job to do what she did with no budget all i can say really really good like no money was spent on this film and it still me away i suggest checking it out if you can great score and of course a script that will knock you on your see it 
 has become one of the best tv series to come out of turkey with its unique and approach to the series has gained a wide following base with rating records broken personally i do not agree with becoming actors hence the lead actor but i guess the figures speak for to the movie it was to see how much someone can destroy such a years in the making this movie was able to oversee every story that existed within the 
 here is a concept for a film a series of crash into a small town and the resulting infection is caught on a deputy 's single camera as the town slowly taken over leave it to albert to that up do n't get within N feet of this what a bomb it might be 's worst yet the crazy thing is there is the of a creative idea in here an entire of an told from the of a when 
 you know this movie is n't that great but i mean it 's about angels helping a baseball team i find the plot line to be this kid 's says he 'll take him back if the angels win the because he knows they wo n't kid to his fake god to help the angels win god helps the whole time via the christopher lloyd and in the end his does n't take him back and off on his right 
 this film is a work from start to end it is both sad yet at the same time the performances from oh how she deserves so much more recognition and george del are beautiful and yet almost painful to watch as the two come to understand each other the supporting cast of workers at the dead letter office are wonderful in them as is alice 's who i could n't help but feel slightly sorry for there 's one particular 
 i realize most people do n't know who kane is and that the film is pitched at that much larger audience but then why bother to call it kane in the first place when the name has no value the characters certainly has nothing to do with the howard character except he has a big hat that 's where the 's always a bad sign when any movie over an story but when you one whole like this for a 
 so i give it one star for true quality but i 'd give it an eight and a half for sheer an strange hybrid of sex comedy and young is just the sort of bad movie you usually hope to find when around the video yet so rarely do it starts off with about half an hour of sex jokes and including an in the joke that has to be seen not to be believed then the main character 's 
 a man if his is at a yard sale he finds a ray gun called you point it at a person pull the trigger and it tells you how they are he tries it out it works and he sets out to find out if his is like him promising idea by an script after a promising beginning and terrible acting the entire cast and basically their lines at each other constantly it gets and really after a while the 
 drug a beautiful women and a determined nothing not already done a hundred times before the boat will be well worth the wait amsterdam is the perfect city to pull it off the and put you on the edge of your seat i would say the same as did the car chase in very intense 
 has to be seen a number of times in order to understand the it contains if you 're not used to french films based upon conversation and battle of rather than on action do n't even try to watch it you 'll only obtain to death and opinion that french movies are not for is a film essentially based upon written by by the way and it cuts the of does prefer to be accused of being a child rather 
 what i find remarkable about this film is that altman the crazy and wild guy that he is took the novel that cold day in the park and the dennis character was originally a male in the book he was a out isolated who looked out of his apartment window when he spotted the it is strange that altman fans are n't aware of how he was to change the sex of the main character thereby avoiding the of life 
 is just as good as the original very nearly because of 's remarkable for music and dialogue the of the the group with hats are every group you ever heard and utterly is buy the if you can 
 i this movie because i noticed the cover in the video rental store i saw N 's time setting and thought ca n't be too bad unfortunately after watching it my impression was not too good kind of a but the worst part is that other than the other members of the did n't get enough screen time but its a decent movie to see once i guess and 's role was small enough that she was n't given a 
 i like bad movies i like to rent bad movies with my friends and on them for their then there are movies like this is not just a bad movie but a telling sign that maybe the american movie industry should please for the of the at least scripts before funding a a took a this movie would from that the is and the acting all around is and eddie have perhaps the worst screen chemistry i 've seen in 
 written and john 's beyond is a for anyone interested in world politics and the of personal it a personal and political tale that continues to me up in my mind 's eye with frequency the story line is and the inner and outer are carefully and both and in the story line i 've watched this film at least six times and it really holds up to scrutiny it is particularly relevant today given world events check it out 
 i 'm not going to lie and say i do n't watch the show i do but it has a lot and a lot of flaws N the school is perfect the drama is at a minimum everyone is so nice to each other you know lets give that a reality check its impossible that any school is perfect like free for everyone big rooms if there was a school like that in real life almost nobody there would be 
 i thought it will be a ok movie after seeing the commercials about it it was funny at some parts and some very nasty the only person i felt sorry for is who got a hot wife who is cheating on him with other women but he never got a chance to have a with until the and that was good but they should have made more bigger out the film 
 is a of fast & without any of the it does n't need to have a plot with multiple and surprises but it needs something this is the equivalent of a film where the and dialogue consist of N seconds at the beginning and the same at the end except that this is worse because you do n't get your money 's worth boring impossible race and a terrible waste of expensive beautiful cars which almost acquire negative points for 
 well well one b time just cause of a big i think all i could see is a bunch of their time on a big screen with some humor which will appeal to i do not know who some that will be heard by who some abrupt justified by who race against time u mean waste against time ok so first you your kid then you teach him a lesson we are so of this fact whoever said its a 
 basically a typical propaganda film for the last good war but there were a couple things that struck me first was the use of in two cases the scott character one once at the beginning when he drops his bomb off target during the and once when he is trying to a into being a pilot s i could be wrong about the second instance but i it several times and that 's what it looks like to me the 
 if you merely look at the cover of this movie it 's cool do n't the movie itself put me to sleep it was slow had minimal violence and a poor use of the acting was bottom material and the plot while it would 've been cool for a different movie was poorly shown here they even kill the only character in the whole film i give it a N out of N because the only thing that was good 
 lost his sense of i envy europeans and americans who can watch the film without following the with their because it is painful to do slow heavy and but on the other hand suffer from the poor quality of translation which manages to lose all the and double that make a careful study of the film so much fun 
 i would not compare it to which had more comic moments but & while being a slow certainly kept your attention going throughout the film and reaching a heart warming conclusion there were many moments some brilliant and realistic situation acting by all was a typically french film in which while and which in turn the made the his own i am certainly pleased to have this in my library and will no doubt watch it time and time again 
 people say that is better is a good film but i enjoyed 's life a bit more i ca n't remember a other than the two toy story films that i was laughing so hard the is clean the story is original and does n't the voice are what make this movie dave foley is an that gets himself into trouble a lot is a by the always wonderful kevin as is as there is also sterling support from dennis 
 i caught this on last week and i thought it was typical of the short subject film heavy on style little on substance and does it comes as any surprise that a coming out film stars an unusually attractive and to boy with hair and clothes plus this film in late which works for some 's the virgin comes to mind but not for this compared this to harmony 's work and i agree yet i do n't view this 
 surely one of the best british films ever made if not one of the best films ever made anywhere script direction and acting in a class on their own this film works on so many levels so why is it completely unavailable on tape never shown on tv why is it hidden away when it is regularly shown at the national film theatre in london to packed houses 
 i was looking for attack on there the film is that who is the star of this or dillon i ca n't tell who the lead actor is that 's a pretty big point against the movie right there who have needed the money this badly could he de is stunning but only because of her amazing body it took me ages to finally work out she 's 's sister off friends i agree that the so called people attacking 
 franklin 's the good earth has achieved classic status thanks to a story and acting especially from luis who won an for her portrayal of performance is so complete she is nearly having very little dialogue throughout the entire film and it is a long one relies instead on and body language she looks and acts chinese to the point that anyone with her work could easily mistake her as film remains relevant today because it the to story and 
 i saw this not too long ago and i must say this movie is terrible i watch movies for fun is not fun is stupid you have an that enjoys awful as he his victims actually worse than the one contained in this sentence he has his hard luck story that he uses to justify his killings everyone picks on me the only girl that thinks i 'm not likes one of the guys that pick on me i want 
 i saw this movie on a was standing on street waiting for a bus to go home and a sister started passing out free tickets for a of this gave it a chance not expecting promotional movie i 've seen on the subway station walls do not give this film justice at movie is about a young who goes on a to learn the craft and art of heavy 'll leave it movie is a heavy comedy and lot 's 
 let me start by saying how much i love the tv series despite the nature of a man seemingly unable to pursue his dreams because of his father it was and fun to watch in practice in my opinion it is without doubt one of the greatest british of all time the tv series has my N out of N rating without movie on the other hand is a true tragedy in every sense of the word hardly any of 
 richard who already given us films as a chorus line and gandhi once more surprise us making a beautiful to the nature indeed the vast and in that time territory of canada helps to the stunning beauty of the picked up by the motion picture camera if the movie is really based on a true story once more becomes that men of vision are in truth men that lives beyond their time with a historical perspective that only the time 
 a interview with the legendary italian who passed away in N with close to N features to his credit as director a large portion is spent on 's sex films including his notorious with they also briefly cover his career which kept him afloat during his last decade or so more interesting to me is the section focusing on his and action efforts has plenty of great about actors and his low budget including a story about an assistant collecting 
 while it 's not perfect it 's close love barbara dennis morgan robert 's police chief the the at restaurant and the judge i can go on and on this movie has been part of my family 's holiday tradition since i was a and my children grew up with it too the baby the watch was always my son 's favorite barbara in and the show along with the funny s. dennis morgan has a few great highly recommend 
 why did they not follow the book i am really sad and disappointed i was so looking forward to seeing this movie however if you have read the book maybe recently it might be very difficult to remain objective my wife had not read the book and she loved the for the disappointment are N 's involvement gone with the wind such a shame there is a very small part at the start where the is created but even that 
 after a series of on a island genetically engineered are on the loose and residents of the island man the channel has made some bad original movies but i think this might possibly be their worst so far this badly written and directed park offers all the usual mad scientists who thinks people killed by the are losses characters walking down long dark alone characters who 's only function in the film is to die a horrible death etc and 
 you will likely be disappointed by this that 's not a is a this movie is about as far from being a classic as you can a effects that are n't very special horrible dialogue a ridiculous quickly and not to mention fleeting tacked on with about a third of the movie i mention the story is less then 's no way this was supposed to be serious movie yet it 's to stupid to be funny in any good 
 as i type these comments i 'm watching a of this movie that i just got from a mail-order dealer and i 'm finding that it holds up extremely well with strong situations and action 's been a good N years maybe N since i saw hell below but the one scene that made an extremely deep impression on me was sterling 's death scene which several other have mentioned here i have n't gotten to that scene yet on 
 initially i would have thought that secret had something critical to say of and here being and if it would be something of a against the of blind faith or the power of those who are supposedly than surprisingly it was none of the sort and was largely putting in place events as a matter of fact and allowing the audience to draw their own and i ca n't help but to at the role of song a man who

 just to correct something in a previous review here i do n't believe this film is only for people who know london it 's a case of a very specific situation being used to make universal comments jack rosenthal says in an introduction to the published script that it was meant to be about characters who by going though this knowledge test gain some measure of think it 's one of the most i 've seen technically it 's at 
 as i looked at this movie once again i think it belongs among 's greatest films the first time i saw it i was just away by the action and it has the ending the the innocent man or by circumstances some great shots the jefferson in washington and penn central in new york it also has great supporting actors with 's daughter in the role of the younger sister to ruth roman and the leo g. in another of 
 how she moves springs to life only when its cast members are up their heels and their stuff for the camera otherwise this story is low on energy low on and low on anything that might make the movie stand out from the dozens of other films that have come before has modest appeal as the inner-city who finds that the best way to raise her private school tuition money is by entering but both she and her fellow actors 
 a friend of mine bought this film for and even then it was grossly despite featuring big names such as bob and the burt young this film was about as funny as taking a and it straight through your it uses tired bottom of the barrel techniques consistently breaking the fourth wall as talks to the audience and seemingly of plays a on a cruise ship who wants to make it as a successful in order to become successful with 
 my N year old daughter is very into the series of movies i 've had mixed feelings about that not wanting her to buy into the whole image of things and recognizing that the movies are a marketing to convince young to buy more and make more money for mattel this morning though she asked me to watch this movie with her and it being a saturday morning and with not much else to do i agreed i do n't

 the first season of is playing in finland and i ca n't believe the amount of that this show puts on the characters are poorly directed and 's a poor ' or actually without plot although has potential it fails due to the lacking of the director who has n't been able to extract the of the show from the actors it 's actually sad to see a show throw it all away when it could had been a show 
 i had never heard of this film till it up on cable tv and i ca n't understand why arnold as an action hero in this film is an who is and given an identity as a with a quiet family life in a rural town she continues that life for N years with a husband and daughter clues start coming to her that she may have been someone else especially when someone tries to kill her it seems that

 my husband is a huge robin williams fan i like him too but have generally found that he should stick to what he does best and focus on roles my thoughts were confirmed with this movie i was completely throughout the entire film the story was predictable i realize it was inspired by a true story but my guess is that there could have been some or even while maintaining truth in the story none of the characters were well

 i saw this in the early when i was N and despite the long slow meetings etc once the desert section began all fell into context and i loved it still do it has aged very well back then i was in what seemed to be a tiny minority all criticisms seemed to concentrate on the lack of action and i 'm no longer in such a minority it shows in a somewhat way the political unrest confrontation repression and 
 i 'm not a movie i 've liked lots of movies that critics hate and i 've movies that critics love however i have to agree with critics here is just clearly intended to be a comedy it only has a few scattered has poor photography it has poor special effects it has some pretty poor acting and the production values well the sets might as well have been made of tells the story of a whose crew is looking 
 this outstanding film has about the best acting that you 'll ever see and that alone makes this a the entire cast is excellent but then again it had to be in order to keep up with hoffman and it did n't take me long to get on this film and aside from a courtroom scene that is merely good this is entertainment this is a rare film that actually all the recognition that it received see it for yourself 
 i am being in no way when i say that this movie was worse than any other movie ever made worse than batman & robin worse than hands of fate seriously it 's that bad when people tell me that a movie is terrible i use the two scale to figure it out if the movie is comparable to two then i wo n't watch it if it 's twice as good maybe i 'll watch it but only to

 with the little respect it deserves i would like to state that this movie was horrible the had good intentions but the overall quality of the direction and production value was obviously lacking a great deal i would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good hard and then two more hours of their life a truly painful experience i 'm surprised i even found this movie on the $ N where it was placed i thought maybe it

 it really is a shame that films like this never best picture because this one is simply a winner this is by far the most consistently comedy i have ever seen its and design are not to mention the incredible cast i can quote this movie for hours on end watch it 
 a truly film feels as if it were made in the early by a straight person who wanted to show that are good normal people to the point of being offensive suggests that and marriage are the preferred path to for sad who knew the supporting characters are of the the bitter queen the etc and the main characters are middle-class of little far as the romantic & ideological struggles of the main couple are concerned there 's not much

 occasionally funny but generally boring i did recognize robert from welcome back carter as the criminal there is a gut scene with the french lady having a bad reaction to american food s. s. and tom arnold are billed but have only minor roles you never get to know the characters and it 's hard to care what happens to them not recommended

 one of the best movie great cast great music this is one of those movies that is so good that when it is over you wish it would go on for another N minutes i will this one many times this is one of those movies that you from the beginning and twist and you throughout the feature the cast is extraordinary without the hint of anyone being in their role you get the sense that you 're really there 
 i watched free money last night & it was the longest minutes of my life with such an intriguing cast i really thought that i was in for a treat especially since i 'm a fan wrong what a waste of talent it 's almost embarrassing to watch at times like the cattle scene & there were so many missed opportunities for why did n't they show charlie 's character going back to 's truck it tries to be a 
 this is one of the best films made about the N scene i saw this a few years back on a copy and was very few of kids know the true roots of and this movie shows some of the such as the and shows how it was back then so much has gone mainstream with and radio and its nice to see the true underground movement of the original scene crash of the is one of my and this 
 i think this is one of the weakest of the kenneth works after such great efforts as much about nothing etc i thought this was poor the cast was weaker but my biggest was that they with the 's work and cut out some of the play to put in the just do n't do shakespeare and then mess with the play sorry but that is just wrong i love some porter just like the next person but do n't 
 this was it i would have never expected the ending if i did n't already know the behind the scenes one thing that i was that why was shannon kicked off and not i hate her i would rather her character die that shannon 's what was funny is that in the scene where is on the hospital bed and was by her side i started too at the time that this aired i was about and my favorite character 
 a huge cast gathered for this which was a box office failure notwithstanding a great sound track i ca n't say it was entertainment nor a cure for nevertheless i enjoyed the film it provided the escape i was after one afternoon a good look for those of us looking for the ideal life a fantasy expect some moments few and an

 if only he had n't bowed to could have actually made a good film from this story it was just different enough to keep you interested so for the same amount of time energy and money as was spent on this we might have had something good instead of it is as good as one could really expect from a hand-held so he gets good marks there it 's really the script that 's at fault as the acting was

 if you want to see a brilliant performance of played to with expert timing and do n't watch this version if you want to see a version with eric idle around in N 's english 's private club society this is the one to watch it 's a lot of fun and a good to and sullivan but after this rush out and rent the canadian version you 'll see the difference between good and great nobody does & s 
 i must in light of the of for this from viewers assume once again the role of the in the as used to say i am my head at the sheer number of comments the african queen this ai n't the period flavor is wonderful yes the acting is fine but no actor no matter how great can bring life to the seemingly endless stream of perfectly and party and dinner table conversation here and i care not how much 
 most of the episodes on season N are awful there is no comparison to zone or outer limits as they programs actually had decent story lines most of amazing stories are well not amazing in the least go rent or buy the zone series i have heard season N of this series is much better also for some reason on the 's they cut out the ray parts which further this the one cool thing is to see actors and

 you know those movies that are so bad that you have to was n't one of them which sounds good right but no it 's not it 's not a bad attempt at a movie that 's fun to watch because it 's or not well acted or has bad special effects or anything else like that no is just plain boring they do n't even make an attempt to be scary until the last N minutes are so it 
 ok about N years ago the funny movie the came out and everyone loved it and now N years later the is brought back in this movie right wrong this movie was the movie that i have probably ever seen i mean when i it i thought that i would be laughing so hard that i would almost my like from the first one but after i saw this i even let out a i mean no to the director 
 the only value in this movie is basically to at how bad it really is with a plot that makes your average writer look good and acting which is almost as good it gets my bottom score one of tom very early films where he obviously did n't have the pleasure to be real the best special effect of the movie consists of a guy dressed up in an fake rubber monster consume 
 the first users comments are very detailed for a very vague movie not saying that i disagree but this summary can be written in a few sentences to get straight to the point this is pretty much like watching the making of a really bad there are a few funny points in the movie but with the kind of things that happen in youth everyday its actually kind of the main actor in the movie is a and both guy 
 finally got to see this classic tv movie on an recorded from an old it is a classic piece of its a more of this neglected corner of in terms of official releases on and the tv movie recommended for all fans of the N 's tv movie much like of those interested should get the book on the subject by david deal television films of the N 's me for a chance to see it its to see it 
 obviously influenced by the success of 's moon and 's this one just does n't make the cut limited special effects a thin story line result in a production that even the cast ca n't save just no here no one seems surprised to much like etc etc pass on it 
 this is quite possibly the worst christmas film ever the plot is virtually the acting in particular is poor at best ben fans will probably defend this film but deep down they must agree as far as i could gather the plot of ben a salesman is told by a shrink to go to a place that him of his and a list of things he wanted to forget from his on doing this he ends up paying the family 
 soldiers ' is the story of five boys most being and attempt to save their school from a terrorist after the american government the leader 's father jr. plays the of the school a guy who tries to in his students a sense of discipline soldiers ' is a funny and pretty cool action and certainly the better of movies i think most of the appeal comes from the cast but also the do n't come off as completely in 
 from all of the vietnam war movies this is probably the most and disturbing and that is really saying a lot with so many spectacular ones that have come out it has this feel to it everything is so chaotic in the movie it you it is not like it shows a lot of different things compared to the other vietnam war movies what does push to such a high level is the the was spectacular here francis ford shows 
 what an awful movie i love monster but i could n't watch even half of the terrible acting characters and special effects there is nothing about this movie the characters come from either an endless supply of stupid or else they are the plot is cut and standard even the is horrible you know it 's bad when you ca n't even depend on the movie to provide some good eye candy no surprises here just same old same old 
 saw this film yesterday for the first time and enjoyed it i 'm a student of screen writing and i loved the way the minor characters intervened just when something happened in a scene i thought the dialogue was very sharp and the of story is rather at one particular point barbara is openly with her daughter 's and some passion in her husband whom she has n't seen in ten years and with the signal shots and then one 
 in my opinion this version of the great musical has only two things going for it daly and the fact that there is now a version with the original script ok williams is good to watch but to me that 's all there is most of the cast seem to be walking through the show phillips has no idea who kim really is and no wonder people walk over harry when it 's played by george who looks like he 
 jean joe and all are unlikely heroes and but strong jean whose strength and resolve help save lives hundreds of miles and with calm and powers joe oh my word who took risks for jean and the other only to suffer the worst pain and who trusted jean regardless of the odds her good humor and everyone around her and those with the to go in with her are the beautiful and musical score adds to the despite the length 
 as others have mentioned this movie is similar to the fly both versions and the lesser known altered states the big difference is that those two movies were well made by people who knew what they were doing and were good at it did not have these advantages is a potentially interesting science fantasy story that had the wrong people in charge of it and the wrong actors playing the story follows scientist dr. peter gene an man working on 
 when i was in school i made a film about a couple around in the trees and talking and i realized through that this was not just a failing strategy but a of canadian married to vacant at social commentary but whatever my own film 's i feel much better after seeing this this thing for one thing mine ran N minutes not N and had more content at that every bit of business here is over for four five

 i 'd completely forgotten about this film until now this was the most and worst attempt to a that i have ever seen it 's message seemed to be do n't use their they might take games seriously go mad and hurt people i can only guess that the writers of this piece thought that d & d style games are form of evil or 
 i saw this movie in part because of some positive comments here on after i had those N minutes of my life back i feel it 's my duty to get on here myself and say please do n't bother watching this ca n't argue with the actors efforts they did what they could given the material but that material is the pace was deadly slow and you saw everything coming about an hour away and then it took forever 
 N out of the N comments on this subject rated this film as worth watching so let me the this is the best that british independent film makers have to offer then they need to pack away their cameras right now and find jobs in another industry unfortunately for me that was N minutes i 'll never see again and hopefully i 'll save some of you from N minutes of your own the idea behind the film is interesting 
 i did n't care much for this it seemed too for a also the seemed to steer me certain characters and yet i was completely the because of what they chose to show me of movie disappointed me because the story and the people were interesting yet the movie fell flat because of that did n't allow the enough time to understand each scene the developments in the story were over in of showing the men in or other stuff 
 i hate movies with that said this one was very interesting to me i do want to point out one thing literally means bat in korean and we all know that in many classic stories you see count or turning into a bat and fly away or we also know that are that can fly thus many them to be as i watched the film i realized that the theme of bat is deeply in this movie more than just 
 god i was out of my head as i watched this pilot i had been expecting a lot from it as i 'm a huge fan of james and not just since i might add and his name in the credits i thought would be a guarantee of quality then again he also wrote the strange days but the thing failed at my attention at any point of its almost two hours of in all that time it barely went 
 i did no research on the film prior to my first of it because it was part of a box set i had recently purchased a box set i got because i wanted to own a man for all seasons and to also so i stick and in the player and i 'm treated to class and confusion in equal the surface the story seemed a simple one man meets woman and her from a couple of they straight away 
 it 's all there two classic a chase through beautiful swedish guns violence sex and a kid style a touch of and some and you 've got this excellent 
 unfortunately the movie is more concerned with making social commentary on a real event but have the balls to document what happened the constant rhetoric of how violent video games are not to blame i get the impression ben is an or how media and music is completely of influence is the obvious message we even get a scene of the two boys burning all their cd 's talk about but the movie only gets away with it because its 
 this movie had a good story but was brought down because it did n't have enough film elements and violence it was like watching a live action it would of been better if this story is what they planned from the start of the first movie so they could of played seeds for where the series was going 
 i many people their first movie on because the movie was spectacular or horrible i 'm writing due to the was excited for the to i thought the original was quite good considering its time period and content i felt it was worth watching more than once this being N i had high hopes for what they would do with this film computers military have all grown so much since the time of the first film and the dead code 
 david is christie 's in after the produced in anyone who has heard david speak with his own british knows what a shock it is because his as is so perfect and organic to the character is the of christie 's books and although i a love for peter in the role his portrayal does n't have that much to do with what christie this episode is asked by a friend to investigate the possible murder of one of his 
 the latest rumor going around is that is starting casting calls for i love new york N so does this mean or made dumped new york or does this mean new york dumped the winner i know flavor of love is coming up to it 's season so now with a flavor of love N and a i love new york N will there ever be a true winner i 've also heard a few rumors that chance will be 
 saw it as critic at the every film that i know and is involved in it is simply love his way of combining different stories and and the truly magic powers part of are definitely worth being out go and get it folks 
 i am not even when i say that this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen this film n't have a single ounce of in its or its story line i can not even begin to count the number of things in this film that are obviously off from the and other movies like it for example the in this film is actually one of the 's sent to guide and protect the of does this sound 
 i was very disappointed when this show was canceled although i can not vote i live on the island of i sat down to see the show on tuesday and was very surprised that it did n't aired the next day i read on the that it was 's true not every one was as much as the other but there were very people find it very sad for they worked so hard and there dreams came tumbling a 
 i always thought people were a little too about these old andy films a couple of them were n't bad modern film critics are not ones who usually prefer nice to nasty so shoes movies like these rarely get i ca n't defend this movie either you can still have an dated but still and cry over the story watching this you just shake your head ask yourself how stupid can you get this is than if you know what 
 i recently watched this but when it started i had no idea what the concept was about what the topic was in short i had no idea what it was was it a was it a comedy routine well it was started a little slow but i think that 's because i had absolutely no idea what type of program i was but it quickly me in the episode i watched had robert discussing fact and in history mainly how 
 i have seen this movie twice now on cable the first time i saw it it caught me by the i was seeing were the guys we followed in the pages of magazine back in the late N 's these were the guys we and tried to become while i am glad that a film was finally made that gives an accurate account of how it all came to be i am almost N years old now and i guess 
 i do n't like grade inflation but i just had to give this a i ca n't think of anything i did n't like about it i saw it last night and up today thinking about it i 'm sure that the hollywood that someone told me about with and richard gear will be excellent but this original japanese version from N was so emotional and for me that i am to think of any way that it could be 
 of is one of the better movies to come out in the past ten years and could be one of the best films of the N 's 's girlfriend manages to find his battered remains after being into the fan at the end of part N and brings him to life in her park her neighbor and his girlfriend are being by her uncle john when he refuses to her so she buys a for him to play with and 
 i first saw this movie in a theater in france a year or so ago it came and went with little fanfare but i enjoyed it for the beauty of the landscape photography and the wildlife the story while nice is really if you actually thought about it there is no way most of what happens could happen in real life i just saw it again tonight here in the states on again i gather it has very limited distribution 
 mark in a great role a rock star to the extent of knowing all his him to and like him when the opportunity comes for him to take over his 's role in the band he at the opportunity however the role of a rock star may not be what it is up to be and relationships can change this movie certainly struck me as having the theme of what you for may not be what you think it is 
 as a ca resident i 'd like to see the who were down the electricity plants to raise the prices get some jail time too i thought the movie was pretty good and has some very pieces while they stuck to how enron rose and i found it really interesting however when the movie focused on it 's it made me wonder if they were really being accurate it 's fine to point out any connection the republicans had to 
 written and acted by produced by some this is and hard to the worst movie ever but at least like N from outer usually had a real actor or two i 'd recommend thief in the only to and i 'm n't believe me watch it for free from poor here links added mostly to reach 's minimum 
 this movie is not what it appears to be is not harry or a here the movie 's appeal comes from its careful manipulation of atmosphere and theme it 's a tale set in the civil war and as such all the film 's action or lack takes place inside a house by southern of all ages and comes from the whole story through the eyes of the character seeing him in the house and held by the women is 
 all of the people reviewing this film and probably many professional film just do n't get it this film was made with and art techniques quite like the works of the great if you want to know what i 'm talking about i suggest you get any of 's films such as the world of to the beginning of time or on the if you are unable to a film then read the reviews in they will explain the processes 
 pretty pictures with a cool sound track do not constitute a ' like all pop 's are are only by its ' budget one dollar spent on this was one dollar too many stick to pop bono 
 the first half of the movie is not that bad actually although there 's not really too much in the characters the story is somehow funny and generally ok with potential to get better which it the second half things start to turn for the worse not only for the characters in the movie but also for the who will be basically waiting for the story to come to its obvious previous user comment mentioned it 's a love story 
 i enjoyed the first 's comment far more than i did the film when i saw it at a theatre in the early 's i was impressed then by the care taken to create so closely after the drawings but to me the cast was largely their by the while the direction i think of as being unusually and the photography the rating down at the time was a which means not worth sitting through even once i too would 
 or fires on the plain is a film that is so excellent on so many levels that not enough good things can be said about it my only regret is that i was not able to see this N film something of a film i tend to look at films for their artistic merits based upon acting photography and even the efforts to remain true to the period in terms of ultimately i want to know if the film is 
 the emergence of and his dubious influence on the likes of guy may have triggered the wave of british we 've been over the past few years but one of our most famous acting exports only serves to the cycle by lending his considerable name to trash like this i only wish he 'd taken a moment to consider before choosing this project for the same reasons of personal gain he admits he often employs it 's not only his 
 i have a feeling that dr. was intended for an audience composed entirely of children i think i would have had a better time if i sat at home and watched a my favorite characters in the movie were the pet and the two alley mice 
 recently when i was shopping i saw the of and i thought ' i remember that ' i used to set my alarm to get back up & watch this when it was on N in N at i was N i remember it mostly because it was really scary and weird no person could ever be as as buck with a b no one ever was anyway what me though was they did the same thing to the as 
 not many reviews hence thought i would add not go by the other reviews this was a excellent is one of the very few indian directors that can actually put together a really good and given yet another example of great acting as does too which was a little unexpected but great to surprised there has not been much around considering how good the movie then i thought and i thought too was good a fairly long movie but definitely 
 although i had previously watched this one some time ago on italian tv i found it to be a surprisingly this time round buoyed by an international cast of familiar faces including a joseph as the and contrary to many another film of the an plot in place of itself looks a bit and is a bit too old to be taken seriously as an eager scientist still in creating out of one would have thought that he would have 
 i all the inside jokes is what made a classic i thought it was awful though given the ridiculous story and the nature of the characters it probably could 've been a much better and movie maybe all they needed was a real as many viewers have pointed out already is something of a hence all the to the movie the movie begins somewhere in peru during an dig an named paul stand up who offers no or jokes during 
 i went into this film really wanting to like it it a film festival earlier in the year and an cast but and you could tell there was a but coming it 's a failure of a film outstanding character acting by and is destroyed by and the of the supporting cast 's performance is lackluster and most of the comedy is the shows are and a few scenes are completely out of said there are some wonderful moments in 
 opening with some from for cat ' 's ' fails to live up to that classic instead we get an example of 's and series at its most generic unlike chuck jones 's road series which to introduce new jokes to the same setting 's series seemed happy enough to jokes as long as the characters were in a different place 's ' then basically amounts to this time let 's put on a boat it 's not an entirely 
 when became the movie most of us are familiar with a lot of it was sheer action and less of anything else this is the opposite though there 're only half a dozen episodes it is n't filled with action but emotional things the two main action in this i believe are enough to satisfy me after seeing so many series movies and i was completely ready for a movie this movie did a job of that what makes this 
 is a science action movie with a pretty thin on the death of their queen mother two one evil and one good fight for control of the the good sister is being beaten so she to earth where she appears buck naked in a strip club in the middle of a contest the rest of the movie is basically one long chase scene as the evil sister tries to find and kill the younger good sister but the younger sister 
 i am a massive fan of the book and is certainly my writer ever since studying animal farm at i bought the out of sheer burton is an actor i hold in high regard so when i heard that he played the role of o'brien i was watched the on the first and some fears started to set in mostly regarding the frankly terrible theme song hearing the shouting N over and over again to an electronic beat is as 
 i watched it because my friend said we could try it when my father asked if we 'd watch it i did n't want to because it was such an old film how could that be good i finally did watch with that friend and my father my friend and i loved the film the are great the actors were cool and we were crazy about it i guess this shows even though it 's from 's time that does 
 banks needs to teach these that it 's not all about being beautiful on the outside the inside counts for something too a lot of the past winners have looked decent but are and starting trouble for the other i see less involved with the in every season about the only thing worth watching top model for is mr. jay manuel recently had a who was a i felt that she should have done more to encourage her it was 
 could have been such a good movie starts of with tied up thinking cool we are going to get a back but nothing movie starts with the kid this movie probably would have been better if it was n't for the acting i mean the acting was mostly horrible although with the lines the poor actors had to deal with i guess they did the best they could still it really the movie for me the were the only ones 
 i once caught about a N minute portion of this movie on turner classic movies about N months back i thought every minute of what i was watching was gold and because it was somewhere in the film 's middle and i did n't want to the whole thing if i were to watch it from the start i decided that i would rent it immediately well the video store which i frequent did not have a copy so it 
 i do n't want to go too far into detail because i ca n't really justify much time on reviewing this film but i had to give an opinion to hopefully help people avoid the movie the is and the story between to extremely the humor was completely lost on the audience and yes ghost in the shell fans this is not an action or anything like that its an attempt at comedy and the humor just did not work 
 this straight to video cheap is based on a true story i do n't doubt it does n't mean it 's particularly interesting unless you are one of the main characters who actually lived though this experience a young woman named buys a great big old country home really really cheap well as we all know from watching movies when you buy a big house cheap it usually means it 's in some way shape or form in fact the 
 this film is a very good way how the everybody portrayed their roles was story is tells us about who is in love with get later becomes shortly their is a they get the later meets later becomes pregnant but she is not married to movie is very are are to are song is very were excellent is film is in cast makes the movie great to the money and time 
 this movie was for a while in my collection but it was n't before a friend of mine reminded me about it until i decided that i should watch it i did not know much about close to leo just that it was supposed to be excellent coming out of age movie and it deals with a very serious topic aids although the person who has aids is leo the scenario around the way in which the youngest brother of 
 it 's bad for really more of george 's he really is still as sharp as a it is a shame that we lost him this past year but his comedy will forever live on this special is literally one of the i have ever heard a perform even though he is making fun of small children it just makes you the way he says some of the stuff it is true that can literally make something that seems and 
 what a time we live in when someone like this joe the hell is considered a good or even a at all where are the new crop of with brains and talent we need them bad and to hell with this movie is about nothing just as the characters in the film stand for nothing it 's this horrible so-called that is full of some of which declare themselves with out to learn anything about the craft before shooting well 
 this movie deserves credit for its original approach it combines elements of theater film and unfortunately it falls flat on all levels the films biggest weakness is it 's to commit to anything it has camp and elements without ever committing to any of them as for the story itself de is in his grave at this horrible which turns the innocent into a most and likely two types of people will see this or speaking as one of the 
 i understand checking out will likely be released in in the usa in june N and on in november my recommendation is to not miss checking out this comedy film will everyone who will all to the characters family relationships and multiple social issues that are portrayed checking out will make you throughout with quick fire humor built into almost every line and may make you cry in a positive way as well the subject of is dealt with in 
 this movie was nothing like the book everything was mixed up or changed most of the movie was things that were n't even in the movie never should have been viewed it was a great disappointment to me when i enjoyed the book so much and then to watch how this movie the entire would never recommend this movie to anyone that is a fan of nora roberts or this movie is not worth watching with how off from the

 so fox pulled the plug through a how is that do they expect us to invest our time in their new shows when there is a realistic risk of never finding out what happens why were n't the remaining already episodes aired in the us they were broadcast fox are you listening this was a great show but you left us hanging if you 're going to introduce new at least air a conclusion before abruptly ending every time something

 i just watched this movie in high definition on television i am in a due to a and like to watch the few films made about those with physical first i found the main character somewhat noble and his message about the disabled and the life time he spent fighting to have the disabled recognized and integrated into mainstream society 's job market is great and my problem is n't with the real person who did these things he was 
 i was looking forward to this movie as everyone was talking about it as being a good movie and finally an european one so maybe my expectations were to begins with a good quiet but it lets you down right away in the following scenes where the plot begin being introduced as the acting and the of the characters reveals itself no better than any for tv ' drama it keeps that way right into the the part of the 
 this movie begins with an ordinary and it insists so hard on this ordinary feel that i lost interest within N minutes of watching and started scenes it seems to me made this movie is to the extent of becoming trapped in a permanent unable to anything else but death and destruction well i ai n't one of the dark kids from i want a movie that within N minutes gets me well into an interesting story i wo n't

 i really enjoyed this movie and its message which is about to live life to the very with and funny and sad scenes very it was a pleasure to watch here are my exceptions though the movie was way too long and at some point it kept adding more and more additional conflicts so that it started to lose the main story line i disagree though with another comment that its to have so many people with strange problems in

 i was disappointed with this one having just read the wonderful story i had hoped for at least a little of the magic to translate onto the screen well there was none this version played like a down reader 's digest movie not only did it feel rushed it was and written major characters and plot points were either changed or completely removed i appreciate the difficulties in trying to bring a novel to the screen especially on what may

 ok so it may not be the movie of the year apart from the brilliant that i think won a few but it is a really great film about kid ' prince take your pick and the around him living in minneapolis playing his music the music is absolutely in my opinion you have to own this it is truly a classic and sums up the sounds and feel in a wonderful fashion and the movie itself plays out a 
 i do n't know about the english version of this movie but the norwegian translation is the movie i 've seen in many years the characters say so many funny things and make so many weird to current events that i 'm they kept having more options like the architect who can never say the name of the it becomes things like i x and which is norwegian for foreign the word many of the does not give any meaning 
 i guess they reward today because whoever came up with the concept for this movie was not shot on is a the worst of every and high school movie is dragged out around and made even more every character in this movie has a story beyond lets for a where the whole school gets how does a school so run down have the in the first place 
 this work is pretty atmospheric with a couple of surprises a few really elements i found this work more rewarding than i first expected given the reviews this receives here at the comes across as natural and honest given the circumstances although the overall run of the film goes from predictable to with the falling down when they should be running and investigating strange when they should be their doors typical movie local characters are some of the worst as 
 i 've watched this twice and although i 'm an major movie most do n't hold my attention this film however was almost every shot is perfect saying so much more than an audio commentary which this does not have concept of this film is amazing i ca n't it enough who would have thought amazing and excellent choices of interviews film of a factory in china the film makes you feel like you are actually 'm political aware and 
 this movie made me think of how i could write something about it without personally the director and all the actors who as an australian i am proud of for actually getting out there and making a the movie itself let me tell you a story found this in my local rental shop yesterday and had vague of the reviews at the time of release here so i thought i would give it a some reason i decided to watch 
 stunning most definitely i have seen few films look this good in some time sky and the world of tomorrow uses striking computer graphics and creative designs to create a world that is historically familiar yet something quite fresh the time period seems to be the or early the movie tells of recent attacks on new york city by stealing and the like for some reason also of relevant scientific minds who can stop them and save the world it

 i 'm not sure what dragged me into the to watch this movie but few minutes after it started i wanted to leave the theater for a while i hoped at least the story will surprise me but then realized it 's a waste of time there was just nothing there i stayed only because i had another show after some designs where quite beautiful mostly of the environment but the characters were terrible both in terms of and design 
 do n't bother to check for logic there is none but on the other hand there are many really great movies that totally lack logic so why bother i both like and dislike this film i like it because the action in the air are really great you get to see a lot of i also like the which is a very cool there are just too many to make me really enjoy it i guess it 's not fair 
 someone else called this film a movie and i think that fits pretty well that 's the concept at least a group of each with their own vice catch the eye of a he decides to teach the a lesson by making them part of the show a cool idea but could have been executed better the fate for some of the is in your face too obviously while other characters could have been out more also the ending was

 about N minutes in my wife was already wanting to leave not so much because of the material but the lack they decided to fill in the where the funny stuff should 've been with as much language and absolutely talk as they could when this would let up very rare we 'd sit back and watch not laughing mind you and wait for the next or offensive remark s after about N minutes we both got up and left 
 this was a very good film i did n't go into it with very high expectations and was surprised by the acting the script and the was and so was joan they the show but the other actors played their parts also very film 
 about from the la pits in los angeles even if you attempt to suspend by ignoring this you 'll still be with at the plot and wildly reckless scientific plot that parade across the have a theory every successful actor is doomed to appear in at least one bad movie at some point in career this was lee jones 's turn although he makes a decent effort the script is just so even he goes down in sorry about that 
 i was actually planning to see this movie when i noticed it in my tv guide but after about N minutes decided time is definitely more precious than who 's that girl could ever be worth describing how bad 's acting looks like is impossible and the end result is one of the most characters ever captured on film this is an to movies and i almost never rate a movie i do n't see from start to finish but 
 michael jackson is amazing this short film displays the highest standard in music video and will ever be able to this of pop ' it shows michael turning into a and in the street with some spectacular the story is great the scenes are the music is and overall the is fun and is a real today everybody is still doing the same thing in music video with and which he this video is the of and will forever be

 do not waste your money or time terrible movie bad acting plot all over the place really really bad acting man this movie is just plain bad i shut it off at N minutes the script is bad the is bad it seems to me that a high school group got together to do a project for their drama class yes it 's that bad the acting is not convincing at all mind you i saw only N minutes of

 do n't mind what this person above says this show is it shows how a lot of single men are in a bar atmosphere and also shows that women are not as as men think they are the contest aspect of the how is really cool and original its not the standard reality show that we are all used to now a it a chance everyone we are only one episode in we finally have some canadian programming that is

 bruce lee was a great artist but this film still is probably one of the worst films ever made it has bruce lee die as the result of falling off a helicopter after being hit by some kind of a to the back of the neck but it does n't explain how he came to be on a helicopter since the prior scene has him near but not on the helicopter which is already N feet in the air it

 he was my hero for all time until he went along with if you can call it a movie i went to the show to watch it and come out and not just asking for me money back but asked for double the money how bad my hero 's acting and the hole thing was i ca n't believe that steven 's career has hit so low that he has been reduced to making rate films with rate secondary actors 
 an amazing film i 've only just seen it and i already want to see it again i 'd never heard of before i saw this film but now i am i ca n't wait to see his others the film takes a whole new perspective of shakespeare 's the i 'm sure he 'd have it for 's use of the the play 's themes of love magic and atmospheric tension ok ok there may have been a bit 
 this movie is if you take it too seriously of course you will hate it however it 's quantity of and right brings and memories of about N years ago i like its ability to make me simply at obvious jokes and and its ability to make me want to watch its bill and ted 's excellent N if you are looking for a film full of jokes and totally mature humor do n't watch it however if you want 
 words can not describe how horrible this movie is well maybe they can i 'll take a at it N hollywood makes more talking animals set in graphics apparently script and are n't needed violent kids movie but yet one of the characters is attacked and stupid the movie is actually the farm animals as having human in the fish could talk but for the most part they are still fish we only hear the english as a translation in 
 of had a lot of things that could 've made this quite a good film mansion a chamber a host a a in the etc but to say this was n't made very writer and a skipper get on an island owned by a count in a castle his and a the count becomes more and more that the two men are of all things and gets more inclined to turn on them and subject them and the who them 
 you would really need to remember the and have a clear understanding as to where and how they into the second half of the in order to fully appreciate this is no plot as such basically it 's a crazy mixed up of various unrelated but it is interesting and entertaining in its own way once you get onto its in short it was a classic and well example of late experimental it contains some good some and plenty of 
 this could have been a really good movie if someone would just have known how to finish the story was going along just fine and heading that point in every movie like this where the gray characters turn good and the bad guys get their just and boom it 's like they ran out of script and the cast just started to make things would n't have been so bad if the cast had just continued with the character development 
 is a wonderful director when it comes to and broken arrow remains in everybody 's far as is concerned he should leave that to knowing people like george or the douglas the is so predictable that you will not be surprised once while you are watching such a wood 's character was inspired by fannie 's of life see and but who could believe she 's a black man 's daughter anyway susan was more credible in of life and 
 interesting western from a director who had few in the much like other anthony pictures the far country a potent pot story with an knowing of both of which play out some of 's like integrity and of course death the story sees fortune hunting partners jeff webster james stewart and ben walter travel to oregon territory with a of cattle aware of the they plan to make a profit selling the cattle in a town in they find judge 
 the movie aimed at adults is a rare thing these days but does it well and is still a better than average movie which is aging very well although it 's comic moments aim lower than the rest of it the movie has a wonderful in brooklyn that is n't used to the characters or the viewers never appear in it never becomes like my big fat the secondary story lines are economically told with short scenes that allow a

 i can barely find the words to describe how much this piece of trash me why is it that american always go out of there way to as a bunch of bush and worse yet cast people to play who sound utterly ridiculous when they try to the we are not all extremely dark we do not all walk around carrying whether for work or protection we do not walk around naked in our homes and we do not practice

 the andy 's art his search for with the land and the water and his sense of proportion and so gently so it back on to film for the rest of us and 's work and joins it as a concert of time and human presence in a flowing world a world that its power in plain sight see this movie 
 what a disappointment i the but this one was even worse it was very and and at a certain point i found myself and all the time i ca n't believe that people actually liked this movie the role of nicholas was n't very convincing the whole movie felt like a grand tour around america 's most wanted buildings the never flow of hints and was n't very convincing either i stopped paying attention around N minutes what was supposed 
 jack finally gives something besides his usual wooden indian performance he played the of the storm the military the corps before all else even this great film showed the of camp to it 's N stars 
 i 've been waiting N years to see this film i played the as a and through my recently i located a reasonably priced and i watched it this morning it was in probably even a print stereo the colors were quite good very little certainly not but i 'm very very happy with this clean for the film it 's pretty good i would n't say it 's great though there are great scenes in it perhaps may not 
 where to start i was only able to about the first N minutes before i turned it off in aside from the actor playing robin himself the rest were just terrible and i can only stretch my suspension of only so the very opening of the first episode i lost count of how many errors plot and horrible there were it began with some poor peasant trying to hunt for a to feed his family all well and good however 
 i had the privilege of seeing this powerful play on broadway with bates in the lead i only saw one other play in the 's that had an emotional impact like this play did i really looked forward to the play being made into a movie but was very disappointed when i learned that bates would n't her role in the film she was n't well known off broadway at the time and the producers must have wanted star power 
 i have to admit that over her dead body actually was n't as bad as i was expecting my mom wanted to see it so i it i figured just to go ahead and see the before my eyes but actually this was n't too bad i was just expecting this movie but it seems like the writers meant no harm but the casting of parker sorry she seems a little off set for the movie i think i may 
 's performance which won her an award is at least on par with her effort in three years later is also good and for those who are interested alice appears as 's child and michael best known for the castle is a also is currently the host of program better homes and gardens and is the host of programs including hot property hot auction etc this film the belief that was australia 's top female actor during the rating 
 ignoring if possible the smoking which seems to be mandatory in australian films the cast of this movie gives a reasonably credible performance that 's a far as it goes the rest is simply awful the plot 's with which are meant to look good on film but go nowhere a gross example is the giant float obviously left over from a town parade and donated by the local factory it was just too to waste what was hopefully a 
 i actually to lifetime channel by mistake just as this movie was beginning and watching it it certainly deals with a serious issue probably more than we realize in terms of this type of attack of a young woman by an who feels he 's above the system and unfortunately often cast here was and the performances credible a lot of these are however this is one i might label as while the fact that it was n't presented in 
 if you 've never experienced the thing that is here is a in N mae 's voice for the character for the studios version of the comic strip does her best walking around and ringing her hands or herself to the 's i kept waiting for her to say but instead it 's something always happens to somebody the first time i saw this film i loved and found her character really funny i 've since seen her in other 
 i have to say as being a fan of the man who created thing probably his best you got this i ca n't think he put any effort at all into this like he did with cigarette burns at least his son made a decent have to look at this from the standpoint that it did n't seem like a movie it looked as if someone else directed it for one thing i wo n't believe carpenter put any effort 
 the wind easily one of the worst films ever made the only good that comes from this kind of is the fact that seeing films like this get distribution makes like me confident that my feature will make the cut too i mean if this represents the market for i could make a fortune myself taking out the garbage for N minutes a complete list of what this film lacks would take way too long to write out but the 
 in all honesty if someone told me the director of 's series of unfortunate events city of angels and was going to do a neat little low budget film and that 'd it be real good i 'd say that person must be but that 's what director did and it was really good N items or less has a similar to films like before lost in translation or more recently once it involves the chance meeting of two people 
 i read the other comments here about this movie before watching it if you 've read them you will know that they are almost all negative i really do n't understand that i admit that it is far too long it needs about a half hour cut out to speed it up a bit the music is often inappropriate but strong performances by ford and thomas are indeed enough to carry this with all his fame as a movie star 
 but how can you stand to a baseball team that ca n't win for george it is not easy as the movie opens roger and his best friend milton davis jr. are riding on bikes around the angels ' stadium when they return to foster mother 's home roger is to have a visit from his his mom is dead and when he asks his father when they going to be a family again he father jokes i say when 
 another well done moral pieces where the makes it hard to decide who to root nothing else the anyone who said there were no good parts for in least in there were four excellent parts for in this film and all were well cast and well did a fine job as and would go on to play june this must have been the first time an adult male box office star shared an extended with a girl on camera wonder 
 you know all those letters to father christmas and that are sent every year well it turns out that they are not actually delivered but dropped off in a corner of the post office to unless some bright spark figures out a way of posting them as bizarre go it 's a winner and one which perfectly fits the strange movie that is dead letter office having said that this is obviously an australian film as opposed to a british 
 anyone familiar with my reviews on the movie will know that i can be a from time to time there are a lot of films i do n't like which for some reason i 've felt the urge to review however if anyone out there is to know the name of the worst film i 've ever seen look no further than without question this takes the title of the no N awful film i ca n't believe that i 
 dislike this movie and everyone would understand why the plot is poor so is the acting but in my opinion it is better than halloween N although even this does not give many surprising moments a few scenes are really well directed but these few moments do not deliver the reason to rent it i do not violence in movies but features extraordinary strong and bloody scenes which do not fit to the tradition of the the most aspect about 
 william shakespeare 's merchant of venice century venice al plays a jewish loan who on a catholic that has looked down on him the movie is a slow moving plot in the beginning that builds up throughout the two plus hours the film gives a very good and believe appearance to it 's characters especially when hearing that plays a one might think that it would not work looking at 's previous type movie roles nonetheless it works very well 
 why did they have to waste money on this warning contains the plot meets a guy her gets and with the guy they down a over an girl guy has to stay in town to build a new perfect for the love story to begin but the girl is dying is n't that a surprise boys and but she teaches him love life and enjoy it he 's sad she is dying she dies he is sad but has now 
 for several reasons this movie is simply awful other have listed some of this movie 's historical errors well i have a 's knowledge of roman history and even i found the i usually errors in historical movies because i understand that the purpose is to not educate and shrinking a long down to a two hour feature requires some let 's say historical license but this movie goes well beyond mere 's worse to tell a story from a 
 i think everyone was quite disappointed with this for one thing it was directed by tim burton another thing it 's a of what is supposed to be a classic i found it boring gross and ridiculous if you 've seen it you know what i mean just about everyone at say it 's and boy are they right if you have n't avoid it it 's a N out of N

 i have seen a lot of films and always found amazing the way he music dance drama and great in his movies shows an even better dealing with and a more contemporary concept of dance and music another thing that called my attention is the fact that in this movie and musicians dance and music are equally important the camera shows various aspects of music interpretation not only technical issues but also the emotional experience of playing the interest of

 this movie is not a movie there is nothing scary about it it 's more of a and it does n't make sense to me there is a few scene 's with bodies for instance he woman in the beginning of the movie that get pulled away returns for a scene in the with and she and she completely disappears then she the police officer to put him out of his and he disappears plus had to shoot him in 
 susan she made this movie for me i 've never her acting more than as i did in this movie she really acted as though she were august i can appreciate actors and who leave their individual and create a character who 's truly as ann august helped create the ideal as their characters developed through the movie the movie was about them so the other characters were gave this movie an eight rating but susan received a ten from

 an excellent interpretation of jim thompson 's novel this has all the elements turned widow with turned and a plot for yet the film never into country but remains fresh and intriguing the performances are all particularly bruce 's role as the uncle there is a uncertainty to the film 's movement which or not adds to the grim proceedings highly recommended

 this review has been due to word the the ' now N and now N the sentence which is as famous as here 's looking at you kid ' or are you ' to me ' or may the force be with you ' or i 'll be back ' means a little more than some when it is spoken it in the air with an importance and meaning that does not go what might drive some viewers is that

 i marked this so do n't be upset when i wrap this up now i went into the movie expecting to see a very predictable movie and i was right as almost every i have ever seen it was predictable but not as bad as most what helped was the story i did not expect there to be a why to kane 's but there was and while somewhat you still got the idea and understand the now of course

 yes it 's true that it was who leads me to this movie because without her i should have never pick i find it long and above all all along i thought that the story was full of and the very boring so it was a surprise to see that the director and writer are the one and same person i take notice to remember to avoid all his next 's a because all good things were at hand malaysia 
 N N d jonathan scott rick dean anthony peck j. why even bother reviewing this movie another stupid movie in which top secret military guys discover those and very running around killing people in ways the original was bad enough the was even worse this falls somewhere in between though unrelated to either of the previous films rating N out of rated r for violence and images and

 so the first few seasons took a while to get going on the special effects way but from the beginning hidden has given consistently good story lines and performances and have always been willing to mistakes they 've made they advice people to see newer episodes first so they can see just how good the show is and understand how much it has changed since the first episodes the cast have a and it shows the influx of guest actors 
 this is an film it is part comedy part drama part the is most of the actors and were very famous in their time and for good reason you will probably recognize someone even if you do n't usually watch older movies they are also each in a role that particularly suits their one correction to make on another users comment is that two people not one are announced to die in the accident maybe the two are a reflection 
 if at least the and drawn out deaths had a purpose to the story to justify their but the script was just and just plain went nowhere the story had no it was just a bunch of drawn out scenes and a really stupid ending tacked on as if to say the end you my and my few defenders for watching my garbage i do n't get it a who never had his removed in prison a prison rape scene 
 for a writer allen really lets the paying down with this attempt at character development there are a few entertaining moments but no more than one would have listening to their tumbling tennis his time in this movie which fails to his usually funny delivery did well but again did n't have the room to move in this otherwise like movie the movie is so heavy and that it can not be carried but if it were carried mitchell did

 now i like victor herbert and i like mary martin and jones but it would have been nice to see a real of victor herbert walter connolly as herbert does have a decent to him in his latter and martin though the herbert music is just there to the plot line concerning these two musical performers jones 's john is a character very similar to in who jones also for mary martin it 's a mystery why she never had 
 i can see what this film was to do unfortunately it just never quite the deal the reality crime aspect works fine and the shots are all first rate in fact quite a few of the scenes are in a moody sort of way notably the of the talking to the beat up woman the scene of the going through the garbage and the father flies on occasion s few scenes down in too much instead of showing the the

 N great message great very good 's hard to go totally wrong with robert robert young and robert all together as the three male leads and with director edward pulling together a complicated murder and that 's reason enough to watch it once and even might need a second look to fully catch the plot as it is explained too much or shown in also too much because it 's a little complicated without good reason but it makes sense 
 my lovely from a play written by who apparently liked writing about frightened women his first and best effort was the for the he also did a young cause for alarm a couple of years earlier the play wrote was originally entitled the man and it ran for N performances on broadway during the N season it was 's only effort on broadway and it and richard boone the roles that and boone played are taken by and robert for 
 i just purchased this movie because i love to to operation the charity on which the movie was based but i found the writing of the movie to be very strange it does not really focus so much on operation or similar organizations like the train and their efforts to relieve the suffering of children born with in third world countries no it on an american volunteer whose life in california includes a mother who brings her to a doctor 
 as a sort of between waiting for and a mighty wind best in show a dog show and the various people who bring their friends to participate some are weird some crazy and otherwise but they all make the movie good director christopher guest is particularly funny as very much trying to promote his dog eugene levy parker michael and bob also do great jobs i ca n't imagine them not doing great jobs at least not in a christopher 
 this is a movie that the do so well low budget type roles well executed the story is a little weak a recently decides to round up the ' a all well almost all girl band who performed during the war in london the who thinks she 's gone i did like the way the movie lets young people see that they do n't have a monopoly on feelings love and even that the old can have a good too 
 i thought the this film had an interesting name and just might have proved thought but was i wrong this film was boring especially in the beginning and the middle parts i can not comment on the ending because i just could n't stand watching the whole film the of signing a student researcher just because he walks into your lab makes no sense this student had an interesting type of moving robot in his apartment and enough this living 
 assault on N is the film i 've seen since charlie 's angels the shame lies in the fact that they had a good cast and a good to work with i know they 've said this movie is a of but did the writers of this film actually watch besides the fact that is a western classic the of the film was that the john wayne had to keep a prisoner accused of murder from being by his brother 
 here 's an film i really wanted to like but ultimately could not the lack of script proclaimed in the main titles really shows through and the picture the story is a mess that is n't worth trying to figure out i quickly became within N minutes then suffered through the remainder of the first N minutes hoping for the best before hitting the chapter stops to get to the end even that was n't worth the extra effort clearly 
 fun story of a regular guy with big dreams this low budget film really hits home showing what it is like trying to become an acting success great performances by and brian 's neighbor alex i and even a little 
 just in case the title did n't give it away this movie is review decided to spend as much time writing this review as hollywood probably decided to put into the script i doubt it 'll be published considering how poorly i everything but if this is and anyone reads it stick to the first movie it completely its in every single way the are n't ever worth buying or seeing and everyone involved in making them should be for 
 this film was bad i believe or is it mike in it anyway it was the that did n't have that and looks he plays a man who is hit over the head and brain damage he and gets gordon is the only one worth seeing in this film but he does n't get to do much but what little he does seems to make pale in comparison also the film has some rubber that the guy controls this film 
 the fact that most of the budget for this presumably went on the cast list should n't have if it had been staged with and and some for the original 's intent instead we get bad song and dance featuring and and the final is accomplished by pulling back to reveal the action has taken place on a stage enough for a production that 's more lionel ' blair than the acting talent is and walters are good but do 
 i 've always enjoyed frank 's music and just recently i wrote a term paper about his life story i 've been by the life and of ' blue eyes however i 've never seen any of his movies so i wanted to see if his acting was as great as his well it was i was away by his performance in this movie he really does a tremendous job as recovering machine who 's trying to put his life 
 this movie was amazing i watched it while i was in the town next to the one where he grew up i went and saw the buildings that the story took place in overall i loved this movie one of 's best my favorite parts were the science fair and all the times with his father they were so sad it seemed homer wanted to follow his dream and his did n't seem to care one way or another that 
 seriously i 'm at all the good this show has here all we have in this show is two stupid kids who keep doing an and they do funny things only in like N of the shows while most of the others as then they comment on music which i can not stand personally while they either love or most episodes the only things you will hear are the let 's go score with some or i 'll kick your 
 getting lost in space frozen for N years that 's unlikely falling into a star falling into it the day it goes and getting by a ship just then it 's not 's heart of gold to the rescue it 's also not the parent of the year after sentencing her daughter to two years ' on an abandoned the mother encourages her to get drunk and off alone with the strange man they 've picked up this their in 
 opening credits great music just right for this film to great excitement in a sort of way this is how out of control some lives can become and its consequences not as an but shows how it really does happen in our society it is better than of another wild group because all films books etc concentrate so much on 's mind rather than the overall picture of the cheap fame and that is so pervasive you want to see 
 this time the gets summoned for jury duty where a corrupt attorney that he looks like a who wants to break out so the two get switched of course most of the movie is a series of in ernest goes to jail most of the to electricity i really liked the whole vacuum cleaner early on overall the point of the movie is just to have fun and i 'm sure that you will this is possibly the ultimate movie 
 having just come home from my third of the of the i decided to jump on and see what others thought i noticed a lot of loved it while those in america just did n't get it that really does n't come as any shock as america does n't get what english and are very english middle class english in fact with a hint of throw in for good measure the film is a lot like our two heroes simple 
 rock ' roll high school was one of the best movies ever made i think the only reason it was so was because of the you could n't have made the same movie and put something like the sex or the clash in place of the it just would n't have been the same young howard vincent van mary paul and the hall just added to the movie the whole entire movie is about the especially so everybody showed see 
 no being a david lynch film one could have the idea that it that mind of his like the majority of his feature films do but it is a very straight story as the title might hint do n't except to be caught in the usual of that usually occurs after lost highway it is a simple film but it is indeed a great film that is both from a innovative and an entertaining aspect it 's innovative because it 
 in her first role williams plays a school teacher who 's the victim of sexual assault she gives a fine performance proving she could be highly effective out of the pool as the out to solve the case george gives perhaps his performance and he is so it john is the student under and although he gets impressive billing in the credits it 's edward as his father who is the in the moment is and at times compelling drama 
 early with cast that most folks never got to see a there 's some wonderful things going on in this one knight 's best performance an actress a road trip in the late N 's james very and moving robert in a part he was born to play and a script with f. behind the this had been made five years later by some nobody it would have been a so much for timing anyway i recommend this to all 
 ok small-town check 's hot daughter check of 's hot daughter whom check corporate land developer who puts profit over people check developer 's a monster then being pressured to cover it up check warning of mass death and destruction if things are not returned back to the way they were check special effects that could have been produced by a commodore N computer check seriously virtually all the of your typical original movie have been into a classic movie 
 this film is awful the is bad the is script and even the sex scenes are the and of the original film are completely lacking this movie was shot in a dark and style a la war of the which is so disappointing after the beauty of the original film 's character displays one expression throughout the film the and turns of the original plot are lacking here the few that do exist are simply the only highlight is sharon 
 your will you in this movie stephen is as a young german student still under his father 's orders although the actor obviously looks near N this makes his relationship a collection of scenes basically to a very young looking girl all the more disturbing the character 's have no and the war serves only as a backdrop for this soft who is one of tv 's best performers shows no passion in what is to be the main interest 
 rule the world and use the blood of humans as fuel however there is going to be a shift of power thanks to a and a woman long as they face off against and gary who play the in this ridiculous movie of all the questions left by this movie the most is who 's idea was it to cast country singer as a who is able to give as good as he gets no do n't get me wrong 
 i first picked up when i was around twelve i was in the library and searched desperately for something good to read then i went to the section and spotted this book at my first few reads through the i did n't really know what was going on but i knew that i loved it i even took it home for a few more reads over frankly i was n't getting anywhere and then about five months i 'm N 
 in the my apt building was finally for cable-tv and since showtime instead of hbo was the only premium channel offered showing recent movies i signed up for it being a writer and by nature i soon discovered the channel was showing movies late at night and until the hours of the morning i 'd never even heard of most of them american independent films and foreign films that had never been given a u.s. theatrical release many of them

 to be honest i loved watching that 's why it a stars because of its this film was a to watch enjoy watching bad films in order to fun at them you get a kick out of story really does n't matter it involves some guy who 's has a and goes around random people but he has a twist nobody ever sees him do it even when in one very scene he walks into night club and off some 
 this movie has one of the worst lead characters ever i say this because he is made out to be the hero when in my opinion everything he does in the whole movie up people 's lives and causes problems he can do nothing right yet the movie makes him seem like the cool everyone should be looking up to he has at all the wrong times he has all the wrong on things that end up making people mad 
 i 'll start the movie first remove and from the cast and you 've got a badly movie stiff from the casting department badly dubbed sound especially during the and listen to the line mr. ad obviously some studio thought that they could cash in on disney 's classic presentation of and the but maybe audiences were either more back then or stuck in a double feature more probable even children should feel at having this movie shown to them 
 in my opinion this is the best show i have ever seen i became an instant eddie fan after seeing dress to kill but i must say i think this is his best work i would say though if you ever get the chance to definitely go see him live it is worth it most of the time after seeing a routine a couple times the jokes start to get old but i have to say i 've seen this 
 this movie is a little ray of in a dark season it a quality best described as plain old morgan freeman plays a character very like freeman himself a successful actor pushing he has traveled to a small rather grocery store to research a part he might play as a manager of such a place he soon the staff and the customers especially the lovely if young woman who over the N items or less items or less does n't

 i have always like this great baseball movie it has a good cast including two tremendous actors and two of my danny and christopher lloyd also in this movie is ben johnson big tony tony and also jay o. and the film has great special effects and acting from all of the film 's actors the baseball scenes are all realistic the music by edelman is very good and it fits the film very well some of the actors who 
 the greatest effort plus the cast ever assembled in a movie by the director tim and susan and penn on the front row someone said that this movie is good because directed and written by tim but i convince you that penn and susan had give me a truly performance that i my heart out their acting is so real no doubt about it that this movie is rated N and out of N 
 in N i saw jury alive he was and he was at ease and looked like and intellectual person in this movie i saw a the actor looks like with affected gestures and they made a the real was someone else do n't believe in this movie i saw this movie after the movies like of fire and N and after reading books and people by and and facts by i was shocked by scenario poor acting and producing and 
 it 's sort of crazy but i taped from both this german version of mgm 's christie and the english one but i got to see this one first i 'd heard that many people thought it was better than the english having seen the other one i can not compare them but anyway this is an excellent early with a performance by she looks very beautiful in this film her face throughout especially when william gets those of atmosphere 
 linda was the victim of a woman chuck i do n't understand how having sex with a dog which is animal abuse as well can be found to be entertaining or funny linda was a prisoner who was into making these films i know some people will this comment but i feel strongly that these types of films fuel the fire of and further feelings women this society continues to women as sexual as opposed to human beings we call 
 this installment very much makes the cia look like a very organization in reality perhaps they are after all the way the plot goes on this it very much looks like one man has the power to killing everyone including his own people in order to kill does a very credible job as trying to stay one step ahead of being killed the entire film he is still trying to remember who he was & how he has gotten where 
 having grown up on and considering the present of on tv and at the theater i was really looking forward to watching two nights and not another it appears to be have been shot on a tight budget robert and lee jones level stars are there is but what the is going on with him four or five buildings on either side of the street plus the mansion make up the entire town of austin the capitol is never seen 
 was not the first to feature mouse the first film to star america 's friend was plane crazy plane crazy was released may N in hollywood california in the silent movie format was released november N as a sound movie it was also released july N as a silent film thus making the first sound film of but not the first film for the little american mouse while many game shows have used the question what was the first appearance 
 this movie shows a row of which partly pass over into one another i realized the passing over late in the movie at first it only me many of the episodes in this movie come along without any and simply try to around that fact using and the attempt of it to stay comedy without any funny personnel and maybe result after watching this movie my god it in my head every time i call it movie a bold attempt 
 i must say that this movie had a great cast locations music and camera work was great she had a very exciting roll very while had a serious roll yet still one for me 's very she of a female of mine what got me in this movie were the very planned camera work and the choosing of the locations the story is very written it is a must see one the one 's who are into mystery movies should 
 i anticipated this movie to be decent and possibly but i was completely wrong charlie cox i had never heard of him until now played an good leading man he was so and romantic me and my friend that saw the movie with me totally fell in love with who i did like before loved her in and made me enjoy her even more her acting was i could n't even tell that she was american the chemistry between her 
 any way the wind is tom who is also know as front man of the rock formation ' debut movie entirely shot in belgium the movie starts on a friday morning and rather between the events that fill the day of a dozen of main characters when the movie ends you have a lot of stuff to think about because most of the different are left wide movie has a instrumental sound track that will rock your off in most 
 well what can i say there are movies and there are movies and this definitely falls into the latter however since it 's obvious that even the makers of the film know that it 's not a credible movie take a look at the closing credits it can be plot is basically a convicted killer is killed he has his genetic material mixed up with some experimental acid that get combined and then lost in the snow the killer now 
 what a wonderful movie eligible for so many labels it never gets science with a script and of high intelligence which assumes an educated audience the kind of english language movie only done in england and shown only in usa art movie houses when it first arrived and never ever done in the characters in the man in the white suit N sir and joan routinely use science reference words like and discuss and explain of chemistry like long chain 
 and possibly the worst movie i have ever had the to watch think goes to ' done even worse myself and my girlfriend sat through it just to see if it could be as consistently dire as it seems in the opening yes it is avoid at all costs 
 possible alert though there 's not much to about this film i saw project a part ii not having seen the first movie i do n't think i missed much project a part two is not only the worst chan film i 've seen to date yes worse than fantasy mission force ' this film is one of the most films the world has ever seen it 's right up there with plan N from outer space ' on the 
 starts out as expected stupid white people going to discover new and exploit them i thought for a while it might be a film it starts off like so many others showing nothing but shots off rain forest for all i know it could be florida at this point you figure some animal or will pop up instead you get the acting of william smith who in l.a. vice and angels die hard he plays an hunter who i would 
 speaking solely as a movie i did n't really liked it not because there were no or because we had a single as the scenario for the whole film actually that was what kept me watching did n't like it because the acting was his friends are all happy and then they 're mad but you have no idea why then they take distinct roles one is the other is the but they never really make the point also the 
 if you 're a kid tale real life see it if you 're a youth kids movies why not see it if you 're a parent going to see a movie with your kids you 're way better of for the the start of this film was a bit funny and set some good premises for the to take place but after the kind of funny introduction of characters and potential conflicts the story turned out when more or less 
 the fourth of five anthony did with james stewart this one involves a hard named jeff webster who takes a cattle drive from wyoming to alaska via seattle he up in seattle with his partners ben walter and morris jay c. that he has sent ahead of time in order to make for the boat trip first he has to put up with trail hands cheating and the of castle ruth roman who believes jeff could be a valuable ally 
 this movie should have come with a that it was to the left behind series i did not know it would be a movie i expected it to truly be a movie about and for entertainment 's as previous comments it would be fine to show at a church but not at a public theater at least not without the consumer 's prior knowledge of what the of the movie is about i felt out of my $ $ spent 
 this movie feels so empty in every scene in the movie the maximum number of actors on the screen is like because everything was shot in front of a blue screen there are never really any and the movie just feels acting was horrible it 's so obvious this was in front of a blue screen because all of the action scenes you can see the wondering around half running when they should be running for their lives looking at 
 i 'm not sure if the were after a movie or N angry men people together the facts to get at the truth whatever it was it was poorly done and not worth do n't watch movies for blood and but because this film had little else going for it it should have shown the actual killing more most were the that we were supposed to feel by the also me that the was among the victims he contributed to 
 if you 're ok with the work of italy 's premier to accept his story lines and flamboyant you should have a great time with opera if you do n't then you plays a beautiful young opera who is given a shot at fame in an production of when the star of the show is hit by a car as any who has the boards ' will know is a production that carries a soon that the show in which 
 christopher 's debut is a one the film was very well received and help land contracts for making ' and quite so following is an example of how films should be made no fancy effects or just brilliant writing and good acting manages to us once again with his writing the actors all to me and i most people did a good job bringing the characters to live they were all and that 's all they need to be the 
 i 've read every of and at least N times and i 'm also a fan of and robins des and so i expected a lot from this movie and i finally got satisfied unlike the first of on the big screen which was n't a real success besides the appearance of this one really the spirit of the comic and we get the beautiful in the first movie the director tried to be too realistic about the time where 
 make the world go away get it off my shoulder say the things you used to say and make the world go dave david and andrew andrew miller were in a one for and the other for a child neither was guilty but faced with charges and their house about to be torn down they ended up in well nothing the whole world except for their house went is kind of weird but funny too just what would you do 
 i do n't know what i missed here but i ca n't believe all these positive comments by so many people on this film i thought it was silly and a bit over the top i did like the performances of henry and michael however the others were just i like b movies i really do but this was a bit further down the for me i saw someone compare the humor and in this to army of and of 
 this should have been an funny movie but it falls flat on its face in fact i stopped watching it through which is something i rarely do bill murray plays jack a speaker who is an elephant by his father whom he had presumed to be dead before he was born he then has one week to get the across the country his on the way are only mildly amusing at best 's considerable go largely gillette is impressive in 
 i just watched fisher on what an movie and incredible young man this movie is a must see for anyone who is dealing with how to overcome abuse and as an adult washington puts in an outstanding performance as well as the young man who plays fisher alert feel good and the most moment is when he finally meets his mother who he was taken away from at N months of age and one of the most was when he 
 this movie is definitely on the list of my top N the voices for the animals are wonderful field and michael j. fox are both brilliant as the sassy and the young but the real is don as the old golden this movie is a great family movie because it can be and loved by children as well as adults and and guaranteed to make every animal cry happy 
 is different finnish film but the things which makes it different are abroad some techniques of are from brown and elephant scenes are shot from different again is a good movie but it is n't so good that the realistic movie no happy end and no commercial some actors did great job was so good as a vacuum cleaner also shows his skills but was so he is so actor he 's and a nice guy but not the best 
 ira 's is one of those mystery films in the tradition of that would be very easy to given any real examination of the plot of the film therefore i will be brief in saying it concerns a play one man who is a famous mystery playwright another man who is a promising writer the playwright 's wife who is much younger and than the role should have been and one german along for the ride director no to film 
 a young man returns west after being in the hotel business via boston he quickly his friends in old california expect him to fill his father 's shoes instead that of a romantic thief known for his female victims after them but silly production has a great deal of talent before and behind the camera but it never takes off this might have been fun material for & but frank looks lost and embarrassed in the lead combination of comedy 
 this has got to be one of the movies i 've ever seen it 's utterly has no style the story is so thin that you can watch television through it and the whole film has so many you could drive an oil tanker through i appreciate a good as much as most male white do but this has got to be the worst i 've seen in fact it 's so b that it lacks everything that makes a 
 i could n't bear to sit through he entire movie do families like this really exist somewhere there have been many comments describing this family as to models and such and i think that that is a great of how they occurs as we meet a character referred to in high school as who of course has grown into a plastic surgeon but only to do good in the for the money and she steve on the first date that 
 N the big trail N released viewed richard harris harold robert in hollywood unveiled his latest film the big trail a western about the west across the actor john wayne in N we are seeing many but few besides the first john wayne film we have here the first film although we only watched the version the decision to film in was essentially the same reason that became popular later to compete with television which had n't yet appeared but 
 it 's hard to believe after waiting N years we wind up with this piece of garbage the original was a high impact dark that achieved status the fine art of as directed by paul this film adds nothing nothing and ultimately up in the big box of failed opening could have triggered an intriguing set of plot developments using a considerably and able cast unfortunately we are treated to a N minute in the life of or is it 
 i 'm N years old and i 've spent as much of my life as i can remember a fan of and films be they silent black and white no budget or big budget there are very few of them that i ca n't find something to like about that said i 'll give this movie credit for good and effects but that 's all this is a case of effects over story truth is we live in a time 
 i just have to add in case anyone actually reads this and has n't completely gotten the point yet these other are n't around this really is the worst movie you 're likely to ever see when the movie started i could n't believe something like this actually made it out for the world to 're not just saying it when they said it looks like a home movie it really does like the director took the family before cameras 
 de combines the worst defects of mexican a rare feat 's it wants us to believe that it is deep only because some scene is another is yet another plays with the tradition of faces the edition is and it is all so has a weak script the main story hardly develops so it has other three smaller stories stuck into it they are only good to make the film last of the acting is bad a true feat baring 
 since it has been some years since i reviewed this classic i have decided to go back and review it more in but first some insider notes from a movie series is one of those that i grew up with it made my it made it miss some of this stuff today that we clearly do n't see as much as we did back in the days well on to the review or which it is called in is a 
 while at an isolated colorado house a girl is by an on the of the N film basically takes the opening N minutes of the original film and it out to fit an N minute time span so it 's pretty to say that the plot of this is pretty thin there 's little in the way of or interest in this movie there 's a lot of wondering around a dark house wondering who 's calling her and all 
 through its running length crash charts the emotional of its of characters when faced with the sometimes and sometimes forms of underlying in american society that and the emotional of one of its audiences sitting near the front and desperately trying to make sense of what movies have become these era we live in has become so complicated not only do we reject even the not very enthusiastic of ideas is always being shot down by what that aims to 
 one of the most timely and you 'll ever watch while the story takes place in the capital of it provides an intimate look into political dynamics that prevail throughout the western while essentially another chapter in the story of the u.s. backed latin american coup this film in what can happen when the poorest people are armed with unity political and the political offered by this film are one gets clear examples of the private media as a force 
 is what is called in the movie i think he likes it too it 's amazing how people even fall in to the same really like it 's amazing what he has done no one in recent years has come back from the and made a mark for i truly expected a great film what with the budget of N and the actress as intense as is i thought he would at a and an emotional role ironically he is 
 what 's with all the negative comments after having seen this film for the first time tonight i can only say that this is a good holiday comedy that is sure to up any person 's day when i saw that drew ben might end up spending the holidays alone i wanted to cry you 'll have to see the movie if you want to know why also even though i liked tom james and after if you ask me 
 i blame birth of a nation myself for the tradition of hollywood of history of which there can be few greater examples than this apart from getting the names of and his crazy horse and the and president grant right the geography correct and the fact that and his men were indeed wiped out to a man the rest just takes and to limits throw in some downright scenes of the try and his wife 's learning of the phony

 i was really looking forward to watching this on what i considered to be some of the most entertaining films ever made growing up in l.a. during the N 's many of these old black and white films were shown on the local stations i even remember a friday night show called strange of science that a different sci every week this however spent way too much time on the opinions of the four famous and how they felt about 
 star rating the works just misses the mark that little bit in between lagging behind the pits based on another of stephen king 's lengthy this takes place in the little new england town of castle rock also the name of the film 's production company where a new store the things has opened the owner and max von you might say a secret there 's an item in his store that everyone in the little town small cash price 
 this film along with are minor the that have passed for movies so far at the and yes that 's indeed there 's not much worse in than would-be who think atmosphere is a substitute for a that 's all you get with the abandoned this is a film that was made almost entirely in the directors head sure it would have been nice if he 'd it to film but this happened instead it 's a very pretty film

 this is the worst of the series by far the acting in tokyo is horrible and you can understand them about half the time the major problem with this film is all the sudden changes from the original like there 's a different girl friend of 's in this one or it might be the same character just with a different name and played by a different why is this film made like a disney movie after about minutes it

 this film is the best living i think of what happened on in compared to anything shown by the major media outlets can only show you what happened on the outside this film shows you what happened on the inside it begins with a focus on a new york fireman waiting for weeks for the first big fire that he will be called to fight the subject matter turns abruptly with the only existing of the first plane to hit

 five was an interesting experience for me because of the question seems to ask the audience three men are the focus of this chapter and present the two involved in murder with both good and bad in one 's case almost bad with such characters i found myself almost glad that they would receive some sort of punishment however when the time comes for the murder and it 's subsequent effect on the takes an interesting and seems to ask

 this movie is never going to be on a list of the top N films of all time but if you 're a list of fun films this is n't a bad place to start tyler is amazing and and everyone else is right for their parts it 's a century counterpart to tom jones in other words just good fun i think that this may be tyler 's film on her way to major with no she sex in 
 this movie has beautiful unfortunately it has no plot in order to have a plot there must be a conflict this movie had none it spent two hours painting a scene and failed to ever place any activity in it the picture to be artistic but fails to pay to the fundamentals of story you love and fly fishing you will find some value in this film just do n't expect a story there is n't one 
 my giving this film a score of N is relative to other films from by the standards of films made just a few years later this film might receive a score of only N or N mostly because the sound quality was so poor now it is possible that the film sounded better and the fox movie channel did show a print it did have a lot of lines and but i assume the sound problem was always an issue 
 i have probably watched the movie N or N times every time i get more and more impressed by how far the wish of a young heart can go and the of both and to struggle for what they believe the whole story is presented in such a way you just get into the plot and before you know it you are there you can see there 's working hard on the mirror a little jump there 's fighting for 
 i do n't know why people except a lot from low budget films but i enjoyed this one as i 'm a fan of urban there 's not too many urban movies out there so when i saw this one on the shelf just the title alone peaked my so i decided to check it out and i was surprised it 's not too often you run into a low budget film with great acting and a good story is 
 man with the gun is pretty much forgotten now but caused a minor storm of media interest back in N when robert turned down both in giant which had actually been written for him and which was subsequently substantially and charles 's intended version of the naked and the dead to make it instead despite some obvious production problems and some harsh lighting that occasionally both and jan sterling in it 's a dark western that more than stands comparison 
 i used to watch this show when i was a little girl although i do n't remember much about it i must say that it was a pretty good show also i do n't think i 've seen every episode however if you ask me it was still a good show i remember the theme song everyone was cast the design was great the performances were too i just hope some network brings this series back one day so that

 i wanted to give drawing blood the benefit of the initial doubt the opening moments with a naked woman out and an about to her and then her blood to drain out so she can use it for her art give the impression that this could be a turns out this initial impression turns out false oh the mark of some kind of lack of quality sometimes they 'll offer up something that is trash but funny and with at

 boom has itself a something of a reputation with taylor burton tennessee williams and joseph one might be to think how bad could it be well it 's a lot worse than you could possibly sad and disturbing fact of boom is that is seems to signal the decline and fall of the it was only director joseph who having plummeted the with and boom some may wish to add secret managed to and in N create his best work 
 i watched the pilot episode for this one with high expectations having just college and moved on to real life i was not in a but a lot of my best were and i got to in a lot of the that they did in their house so i know what goes on to some show is obviously a not a in any way of life or college life for that matter although it does hold a lot of truth 
 i recently got the movie and all i can say it is a good movie there 's a lot of famous rome and historical is from the same writer and director from the code tom stars along with and the movie starts out with the space and time experiment in sweden until one of the is stolen by the church 's most enemy the the plot is hard to discuss about without anything its a race all of rome following 
 what a of a movie so good that they made a film starts off really good with a nasty monster who a few people and a party where the N main characters first set eyes on each hughes plays the a bit of an there to who this character is who has moved into town and uses the services of a particular real estate agent to find him a we 've all seen movies we know the movie is but 
 best years of our lives perfectly the era of my youth and the feelings of that time the cast was wonderful this was possibly best role of his career and he should also have been for an academy award there are so many wonderful scenes in this movie it is almost impossible to list them all the is among the best of any film this movie is a time of what is was like in the N 's a must 
 man some of you people have got to this movie was artistic instead of searching for or messages to justify it in your reality why ca n't you understand that it is a work of a story entertainment for god 's no intended it seems to me that too many of the people on here are trying to be movie critics and they 're not doing to well i 'm so impressed by the movie and bill 's job at 
 like a circle around the human condition N starts at the beginning the middle and proceeds to the ending right back where we started noting the weakness of words compared to image s with dialogue the power and of the and allowing the intelligence of the audience to do the or not depending on the in history N is a high water mark of direction execution and achievement if one considers the of the film a film about everything and

 i did n't really hate i just really wanted more from a movie than pretty the movie begins with a young girl named who works in a circus but while other children supposedly want to run away to the circus she only wants to run away from the circus during a argument with her mother wishes she would drop dead bad move the mother gets ill with something presumably cancer and needs surgery on the night before surgery she dreams 
 an off beat but very performance by john sets off this very funny comedy his interpretation of the is as a man and he certainly has a effect on the women he on his trip to chicago john hurt is very low in his role as chief reporter for chicago tabloid owner bob plays role much as she did her role in four and a is neat in a her comment michael does n't suffer is just one of many 
 the parts one and two was the only during the run of the original series and it was because was able to most of the from the pilot the the move was made out of necessity to combat deadline problems in getting episodes produced such a show back in the was a to get done on time one positive outcome back then was that audiences of the pilot produced almost a couple of years earlier were treated to a whole 
 the french people are not known to be great movie their scores high points at the is a very different film of what i am used to from the french it is a great movie especially for kids the only thing that me was that it was spoken in french and normally with the english spoken movies here in the netherlands i do n't have to read the but with the french language you just have to read to understand 
 intense funny and more than anything social comedy on the ways of adult dating and it 's it good or bad and are engaged couple two months away from a date when a bizarre event at their party forces to the relationship and start to date other people so she wo n't feel so when it comes to sexual experience this leads to a disaster of events following and their very and needed in this time of comedy while containing 
 this is a pretty ok film yes some parts are and exceptionally convenient and the movie does n't really justify the large star cast ab however the actor that really impressed me here was not to be confused with the singer in the scene where he first meets 's character i thought that a man who can just look at ab keep and not say a word and still look strong is definitely a good actor in fact he has 
 i saw this director 's woman on the beach and could not understand the good to great reviews this film is much like that one two people who are caught in a relationship with very little dynamic and even less interest to anyone else like his other films you have to want to listen to wade through very little and become with underwritten pretty characters if you feel you can like this film do n't let my review stop you 
 bad bad movie when i saw the i was expecting something like ring only with video game instead of tape nothing of the sorts happened i 'll admit idea is interesting and could be turned into a good movie but this is not of all choosing real life person is stupid move that adds absolutely nothing to the story anybody even familiar with her story would begin to wonder why and how did this end up in this movie choosing 
 my friend took me to a of this movie in hollywood and it was it 's a film with amazing acting great script cool music the whole thing was very well done and entertaining do n't know if it is getting a release in theaters but this would be a great date movie or a fun movie to rent if you see it at blockbuster this is the kind of movie i love low on budget but big on style 
 as other reviews have stated there are a few missing from this collection but what is on this is overwhelming there are two separate an original recording and a completely new performance version any new music from the residents is welcome and i for a first time the new version may be more but i prefer the original probably simply because they are the production of this is amazing new and old are all interesting with live performance probably the 
 i thought this was very different compared to most modern of shakespeare and enjoyed it it would not be useful for those studying it at school etc as it does not show the traditional shakespeare character is portrayed quite compared to your traditional shakespeare lady but for understanding of the play and for the basis of the story it is a very strong piece and to watch it does not include also the correct format as in the of acts

 i looked over the other comments and was to find that clearly only people who actually worked on the movie had i mean i hate to say bad things about an production but if you make a bad movie and want to comment on it tone it down a little is a little over the top this is a boston based college production that does n't even achieve the level of most college film it 's what you would expect

 this is the best of the films so far that christopher guest has created using his very cast previously they 'd made the excellent waiting for and following best in show they made the very a mighty wind as for their latest for your consideration the less said the film appears to be a about dog shows and several in particular you follow these few chosen dogs from all the way to the big night where one of them is 
 i have memories of watching this film as a child in the late on now in though a product of the this film has hardly aged the effects are just as as N and in some ways superior the model work is with an attractive cast great color photography and set design and an score is a winner 
 though it 's better than most movies buried alive is nothing more than a tale there are so many plot in this one it makes you wonder why the did n't go through a series of the ending has a nice twist to it but it 's hardly acting by is as always but tim it up with that one of jack in the do n't bother with this one 
 it has been since N that i saw this movie and i still remember it as one of my favorite all time movies i would buy a copy if it were on and it is too bad it is n't you would think that anything peter sellers would be brought back much better than being there and as good as the series had a small part for such a well performer she is bonus in this movie i think the 
 the story and the characters really really needed work the world idea is kind of neat but no one bothered to develop any of it either through or through the plot despite the notes at the beginning of the film it makes sense that you would n't use since no one is new to this world and yet when bill and bob peck and get lost and get introduced to the and the fat rich people in the museum we

 boy was this really saw this on scenes that had music it was hard to hear the when people were on the telephone it was hard to hear the person on the other end it appeared that at least two different kinds of film or video stock were used because the colors and focus sometimes shifted drastically between and there were a lot of out of focus shots that did n't seem indicator of the budget one of many was

 ok so the following review is more of a more so than really containing any but better safe than sorry so as to avoid being right right consider officially warned and read on in this to the greatest time in movie history the N 's a group of stupid are getting together to host a in the house of the notorious murder who his entire family a few years back and buried them in the back yard as i 'm

 i was expecting a lot from this movie and i can say i have n't been disappointed first of all this movie as a world tour of wine making let the enjoy beautiful places the people interviewed are really interesting and funny too in particular de the shooting may be confusing the camera always being and often focusing on secondary elements in the backgrounds you may not like it but i do n't consider it as a themes raised in 
 this movie has good intentions at least in the message do n't be afraid no matter how tough it can be fear will kill you in the end it 's a good message but the container is so flawed that the message gets by bad acting complete lack of credibility in the feelings that 's delivered as if it were read out loud instead of breathing living abuses from effects such as to compensate for a complete lack of credibility 
 i gave N to this film i ca n't understand how one of the greater directors of italian made a film like this so stupid and ridiculous all the stories of the people involved in the movie are boring and not interesting too long too boring the only things i save in this movie are and hope that will change themes and style in his next film 
 hitting the ground running the film begins with three in a row no plot no characters no the second murder happens off screen and that victim 's head is actually used to quite efficiently the third victim to death this is a high point but the are obviously smart enough to lead with strength soon they 're covering up dialogue scenes with and shooting endless in wide shot by now this production 's atmosphere is rapidly giving way to an 
 seriously there is absolutely nothing good about this at all scott a homosexual who lived with his grant for twelve years is at his most wooden and boring in the least role at N he was clearly far too old for these romantic roles although it does n't matter so much here because russell looks so much older than her N years and she is so due to her and chain smoking lee marvin plays his usual role but it 
 the film is not for everyone some might think the acting is bad when it is actually and natural there are no obviously evil acts and there are no beautiful moments there is a lot of an lot of this film takes a very honest look at a very complex subject sex with it is complex because the characters are trying to deal with love and sex when her body and are still developing and both of their minds and 
 when i think about this movie all the that come to mind somehow to the physical appreciation of the world color that 's how i think this movie should be in terms of see the rich golden surrounding the young by the or the and let it flood your with of smooth skin oils do n't just watch and listen be absorbed let the voice of the you 
 this is an excellent film but 's other big budget film is much better i would recommend people go to see and then if they like that see this film the film is shot in black and white which i was a bit with at first but once into the film you understand black and white is the best way for the film to be seen it is extremely and reasonably easy to understand even though the way it is 
 as i was watching this film on video last night i kept getting these that told me this one will endure i 've a feeling i 'll be watching this again and again for years to 's got all the you could ask for in a and even though some cultural are for me a western at the core this is a universal tale 
 one of the most beautiful movies ever made in is very familiar to people in because generation after war used to live in the same in the west imagine how political situation in our country affect plot is in the N when said no to the and and because of that our borders becomes open for western in a country were people did n't had much money jeans was only ideal and friendship was friendship between for young people an 
 based on actual historical events this violent bloody and period interest by creating a missing in the majority of films set in a era ms. 's portrayal of the is a tour de force her gradual in character from an if unwilling in social of her day is by telling her of the local duke 's casual activity her love affair with a her criminal to the forces of the prince anthony there are some painfully realistic human in this 
 i figured the whole joke of the movie would be to see some rich white guy acting like chris rock and then see chris rock react to people 's reactions instead you just see chris rock being himself and people not understanding him there are maybe N scenes in the entire movie where they use their this should have been a lot better 
 it was almost worth sitting through this entire film just to know that i can never experience anything as bad as this again acting N script N fight scenes N male lead N bob from eight mile as a war hero who gets the girl N she is and not a terrible actress this is the criteria i used to average it out to a two i lost count but i believe ever movie ever is in this movie when 
 this film concerns types and who apparently can not resist basic romantic needs although some excellent players take part including jon timothy and cynthia nixon they are by a script which relies nearly totally upon dialogue which is n't nixon 's role the best lines but she often homes in on them too quickly a timing flaw which must be upon the director the every available spent or not and ends this attempt at comedy 
 such a shame that this wonderful bright spot on the small screen had such talent in writers and actors such wonderful that was the ultimate for those in a land locked sun deprived state many of the actors went on to bigger things another indicator that there was something wonderful lost i lived in columbus ohio at the time with all of my now husband 's very large family in a chorus of no ' every time it would be 
 it could have been better had it been directed by someone with more experience did n't do a bad job but it is not a great work of is however a beautiful movie i have loved it since local channels used to show it graham greene is one of my favorite writers of the last century some pretty bad movies were made from his novels and stories many love the fallen but i am not among them i think i 
 this movie is great the music with the exception of the very first song in the movie was the story line is too it 's just basically a movie for all ages i found the last battle scene basically this was a great 
 with the exception of about N minutes with warner on the train this was N minutes of the acting was but the story is what i really found the acting was wooden and even by early standards the exceptions being lee and warner neither of whom can do wrong rose was absolutely and as as she likewise was in N 's and an otherwise excellent and the rest of the cast was worse there being no words to describe their 
 i am glad other people enjoyed this movie cause i know it does n't have the greatest reputation and it made no money at the box office i thought it was and there are several reasons why directs with the of the cast especially camp is perfect and the big bad apple never looked better on film you 've seen worse movies 
 well first and for most i 'd just like to say that i 'm back out of retirement from writing well comments about horrible movies only the movie in titled gone wild could bring me back so here i that being said i like to start off with this comment this movie was really horrible i mean i know it was going to be bad but i had no idea that i would be spending N minutes out of a 
 i discovered the in a and thought it could be a real action no instead a low budget movie with a ridiculous story no doubt a and not one for the theatre fortunately after N minutes the movie stops otherwise the audience should have taken an against sleep one thing came over it was the nice country the film has been shot you can really feel the american air but all i hope for steven that he finally succeeds in 
 i would have to say that in general movies have impressed me i have a N year old and she watches them all the time so to say i have seen quite a lot of these holidays but i am not sick of film has a lot to offer especially the backgrounds and the of the characters has improved with each new movie one thing i noticed in particular was a vast improvement in the of 's hair in this 
 was a hit film which was loved by many peoples it tells the story of innocent for who it was a entertaining movie but if you look carefully its not too realistic khan keeps and tells her that he her too he gives an announcement in college that he her and gives her some nice surprises like beautiful photos of her unfortunately instead of being that a guy her too she gets very very scared i personally know of people 
 if you 're not in the mood for more than an hour long movie than this film could give you some what i love is the ongoing surprises it 's not only once that you want one or more of the short film in york i love you ' to be continue some of the short films makes you some of them very short some of them longer some of them has it ends some of them of the story 
 for a feature film the plot closely follows history or at least historical but then the chinese who know the story very well from seeing it portrayed again and again would never it otherwise the attention to detail is wonderful especially for anyone who has read 's account in the records of the according to did indeed make an attempt on 's life at the request of the crown prince of before unification both the head of general fan and

 i have n't seen much german comedy but if this film is anything to go by i 'm to see more the simple but effective takes two very different people on a trip from germany to italy after an mother of two that her artist husband is having an affair with the wife of a wealthy lawyer i wo n't reveal anything further but what results is a very funny series of events with the perfect conclusion my interest in 
 ok let 's get this out of the way first as a piece of is as a bit of entertainment for it 's got a lot of merit if you enjoy watching those old black and white giant or around the desert you really will get a kick out of things the story makes little sense and the acting is pretty poor good things the special effects are decent it has a different british centered story it 's set in 
 this is one of the two fantasy movies that albert made in N and it 's the bad one apparently all his energy went into which was an entertaining action movie and had a much more expensive look is and a that too often resembles a video game new opponents pop up all the time and must be as quickly as possible the only thing that this movie from the trash can is long not a particularly attractive woman but 
 in the islands the greedy and unscrupulous owner of the resort park invites investors and guests for an opening party of his compound composed of hotel and aiming to find partners for his when a bunch of college thieves puts a virus in the security system to participate in a hunt the greatest of the from the age developed from dna found in escape killing the hosts and guards for and cheap attack of the is one of the worst 
 my friend and i this movie for at blockbuster if i 'd have known how absolutely horrible this movie was going to be i would n't have paid a cent i had no warning for this the acting ca n't even be called acting the inevitable sex scene is and you can tell that both feel completely uncomfortable doing it and the male god who could n't tell he was going to attack and the musical my lord this movie 
 robert does a job with this b tone and alan and he does it i might add without a lot of help from his male actors and tone it 's all the way a pretty actress who for one reason or another never reached the status of some of her 's use of sex light and music is truly remarkable as he this the lighting effects and camera are all effective but the highlight of the film takes place in 
 i would have rated this film a minus N but it is not i did n't walk out in the first five minutes of this movie i can not say i should have gone with my and left immediately several people in our theater did and i did n't follow them story lacked all criteria for a movie no plot awful acting even robin williams was so disappointing that i may never see another film he is in not a 
 when i first saw the for this movie on tv i thought that this could be a funny movie i was wrong all though i am not totally against movies that make fun of others some are actually funny such as the first scary movie this was one of many that have been made as of late that are not the humor in this film was anything but funny and was rather feel the one of the biggest problems is 
 i can remember a college professor commenting as to how disturbing this film was reflecting the of this was before generation x a way most of us are products of the same consumer culture these high school kids spend their time drinking getting high and wondering what to do about the body left on a would they do today would things be different some very important questions there are some excellent scenes with and the family he lives with his 
 and jerry is a classic with a idea and almost every single short is a while i must say that this is definitely an short compared such other classic tom and jerry there is not way you can hate this sure it is to say that this is one of the worst of the first tom and jerry episodes and i can say that i agree but the fact of the matter is that all tom and jerry episodes are 
 i can not believe i wasted my money to rent this movie i thought it was a when it started and it never got any better the acting the music out the actors horrible save your money you have to read the movie all the way through they knew the music would out the speaking lines i never got the part about the or the need to continue to show and pigs being what did that have to do with 
 i believe i share the same psychological outlook on the world with he is polish i am dutch yet we share a synthetic mind the world is not of the total hardly ruled by man or perhaps by a minister so that as a social and cultural pressure area ' poland could play the role it did in being critical yet christian the but often not less critical toward there are and in 's world view as the in the 
 has an interesting premises but the story is poorly done without any tension or even a logical approach the cast in even patrick who played great roles in movies like N open fire under N and the rest of the cast is unknown and not very good with the exception of jeffrey herbert west from the great but he can play roles like this in his sleep which is a little what he does here the main problem is that 
 is great as are the photography locations and however the plot is somewhat and the conclusion flat the plot has been substantially altered from 's novel and not to the better unfortunately this is much better read than watched was too narrowly drawn here in contrast with his literary alter who seems more and determined despite his in his new role as an officer from the ranks i really enjoyed the brief scene in which is by a real officer 
 i do n't know why some guys from us georgia or even from have the to express feelings about something they do n't understand at all for those who did not watch this movie watch it do n't expect too much or do n't put some just because this is watch the movie without try to understand the whole humor inside people of did actually getting married while clinton bomb their in all are always try to f you up 
 being a fan of italian and directors mario and i thought of as an i had seen the beyond which i think is totally i found the new york to be simply and i did n't particularly like the house by the cemetery these three movies left me to conclude that is the least interesting of these italian but my prevailed and i had to check out more of his films city of the living dead was a film i 
 leave it to paul sex on the brain to come up with a and version of the man story if he 'd direct a film i 'm sure he 'd turn it into some massive of sorts i do n't mind sex or even check my other reviews on film but frankly it 's obvious the director has a one track mind and he could n't see interesting aspects about an man than the implications it comes with it it 
 another british flag real garbage on offer here once again i can not understand and i am british why this over the top nonsense was ever made eight years mark you from when the second world war had actually ended other 's here have on the and apparent use of this is extremely poorly observed the is in model aircraft swing from wires in the scenes ' like so many children 's in the wind the usual room the movie 
 i had high hopes for this film i thought the interesting i stuck through it even though i found the acting save carter i kept hoping my time spent would pay off but in the end i was left me wondering why they even bothered to make this thing maybe in george 's version there is a message worth if this film accomplished anything it has inspired me to read 's classic i find it hard to believe his tale 
 this is a movie that deserves another look if you have n't seen it for a while or a first look if you were too young when it came out N based on a play by the same name it is the story of an older actor who heads a company in england during world war ii it deals with his stress of trying to perform a shakespeare each night while facing problems such as theaters and a company made 
 as with all of ' films the suspended step of the demands a close and intimate participation on the part of the a fact that has certainly contributed to the limited popularity of his work are with no or exchanges the characters ' inner conflicts doubts or feelings the prefers to keep the viewers away from their own emotional responses and instead forces them to explore and study the characters ' for themselves as a result the acting is and 
 i it was for temple matthews who written basically a even though there are few changes which just make it worse it is much similar to the original 's new daughter is threatened by 's sister but keeps her promise to take away from them did have a sister and she is not that great a as was this is where there is similarity is kept from the sea until is captured but she does n't know a thing about 
 iron eagle may not be the most film but the characters are well written and very well acted if you can not believe the characters the film is a believe the photography especially the photography is i believe it is far superior to top gun to which it is compared it is one of the best pieces of photography i have seen the by the is great and well with the rock i wish that portion of the were does 
 this is the collection of together on a straight line with no plot or any decent way of acting i 've seen in a long time scenes from star wars of fire lord of the and harry it went for an all out war on the intelligence was this movie good it was n't a movie at all even if it does n't go so low to actually be funny and achieve status as a comedy the movie does offer 
 if you 've ever seen open water this is the same kind of style of film i liked the action the slow building of it all i just hope they do n't do to this one what they did to open water with that but the one thing i did n't like was the younger sister i was for the the whole time film starts out pretty much like it should kids up for a trip they hire a guide 
 how can a movie with and have nothing funny in it believe it or not bunny ' did this better and hopefully the principals had a good holiday and got some money this movie is an embarrassment to all of them it is a from beginning to end can work well with a script or at least an idea this movie does nothing but use after rather than ideas or script it uses the 's of the rather than develop 
 i love this movie director michael once stated that this was his favorite movie and it is mine as well and created a seemingly simple story the power of love against the powers that be however its lies in the of its is it real or is it basically one could argue that it is simply a of the effects of war on a young inclined during or is it the question is never answered one way or the other 
 N has got to be the best series tv had ever aired the whole idea of telling a story in a N hour real time period is the style of and is what us to watch it and jack is one of the greatest in a tv series in a long time i rate this along with the and the my three most favorite tv first episode begins with the conspiracy to us senator david palmer who is also running

 this movie is just bad bad bad bad now that i 've gotten that out of the way i feel better this movie is poor from beginning to end the story is the segment is really bad is at his character worst god they killed him off and who wants to see and tom arnold the only good thing in the movie is the little bit of that we 're given on we see he once had a family and

 ok the film was n't going to win any and it is pure and it is a modern update on it 's a wonderful life but it 's just come out as a cheap release on and there are a lot worse ways of $ N you get a film that has a surprisingly strong cast but for most they were still a year or two from becoming b list however it 's an way of passing an hour and 
 yet another production to completely waste the of a young chan to kill with is a strange mix of action and plain fighting that is pretty despite featuring several moments and lots of bad an effort to protect his pregnant girlfriend from the killer a gang of that are about to attack his home chan to be a driving her away and thus saving her from the attack 's are all killed but he is left relatively by the gang 
 this could be the most movie of its i do n't remember seeing any advertisements or commercials for this one which could be the reason why it did n't do so well at the box office however is an excellent and a truly original movie i rank it within the top N most favorite movies on my begins with of photos and news articles telling us about a killer who calls himself god 's hand and then a man walks

 almost golden the ratio format of the rise and fall of america 's first female tv news with a tighter script and direction and a better cast this might have passed but the story really was n't worth the effort a good on the subject might have been the best way to go typically strong production values in the tv movie manner but it 's all as as old and just as engaging 
 definitely definitely the worst film i 've ever seen no questions asked of this opinion might argue that this title should not be by the same criteria as others since it 's an independent film but already the and innovation is with everything that has been said about this film for example the mind weak acting when it 's this bad you take another go at shooting the scene god damn it the thing i found the most was the 
 i was staying in one night and got extremely around N N a.m. so i through the channels and happened upon where this classic was playing initially i was happy to have caught something at the beginning but my faded about two minutes into the movie the whole movie centered around an man who had a fear of four beautiful but empty women who worked as at his uncle 's and his fat and extremely who also works at the 
 it up as the mexican revolutionary though he 's matched by chuck as a military in this yet rather boring on the famous historical figure 's life and times an earlier attempt N with in the role and robert dealt with these events more and on a scale as such is an typical european venture and an one at that despite its credentials the end result is more often silly rather than amusing though a few moments most notably the 
 not one of your stories and that 's a real strength of this film there are at least two relationships in which less confident writers would have added some predictable romantic tension they not only spare the audience this but throw in some surprises at the same time there are a few moments particularly near the end but they are overall it was worth the rental and it was good if you get the watch the segment where the director 
 the films of are surprisingly well rated on despite the fact that the quality is behind that of disney and mgm at their prime due to rising costs in making pretty with high and lovely backgrounds the style which about N began to dominate in the late and after all the films were cheap to make and they 'd received several to prove that the were now mainstream so as a result was becoming the and this trend was n't

 and are i have seen on the doors however his interpretation of john holmes is nothing compared to nights which was kind of slow is a movie which is able to show you a horrible crime story from the perspective from a guy who is just in his drug vice and of what ever happens around at the same time the john holmes character shows a very who is able to pass through the and situations almost the movie deserves 
 this film was a wonderful full of surprises with humor in odd places and a tremendous energy the famous film director the and the events he tries to manipulate through film all become in ways as he is nearly by a prince who has never heard of him there are rich images throughout and suggested but not followed exactly what is going on with the wife of the tourist director the ending is so much the better for being and 
 out of the many films i 've seen boy is a rare film where i can watch it over and over and it 's still funny david and the late chris do their best in this film and is a by anyone who 's a fan of the duo 
 that is my reaction to this film i was really hoping this would have been a good modern day but it does n't even fall into the category of instead it tries to be something it is n't which is a psychological and it fails so at this even the title suggests that this might be interesting match this with the cover art on the and you think ok maybe i will give this one a try not worth the 
 for a movie that was the most seen in its native south korea for most of N it was a huge disappointment shows that hollywood is not the only place where people can make movies the film was over N minutes long but not a lot actually happened and everything that happened was pretty much what one expected the plot was that granted if one himself was korean one would perhaps get into it more but for me it did 
 this movie is like the material was writing in the and was to the screen in the early and had actually been a product of either the results might 've been much better especially in the acting department instead we get a rather piece of plays ray a former street i is the accurate this was in the days of action movies that used guys in their and and dressed them up in or some kind of more selection of

 the script for this movie was probably found in a recently up by a really old dog mostly an film with for you she has the credibility of one mr. 
 it is not an easy film to watch it is over three and a half hours long and it is composed entirely of conversations yet it is so compelling and of the human character that it is in my opinion one of the very greatest films of all film is and if you want something see 's and go which was made around the same time it shows the of the late to be nothing different from the society that 
 well it definitely is unlike anything else directed by lynch no stuff no violence no nevertheless it is a beautiful it 's a little slow but perhaps that was because it 's the story of an old man 's that 's my best guess for its the characters are everyday people and thus they are the performances are good and the final scene was everyone who has a can to it and alvin do n't even have to say anything 
 a movie is a she 's she is a she is still very much in movie features paris in the N 's it is wonderful to look at the sites the cars and simple but very romantic comedy the music is it almost on the other hand it is but it is probably the only thing at least looking at it with century movie comments on the french manner of treating it is that sense modern a movie like elephant 
 what a shame that alan has to be associated with this that does n't rule it out however get a group of and some together and have a of a time running this one again and again and rolling around on the floor in of great wasted night stuff al hunter homes in on a well theme of the late that were well and not really interested in the football often with respectable jobs estate agent but how can convince 
 elizabeth taylor never could act at all and she was just her usual in this film this was before she got so fat but she still looked very short and rock hudson was ok as but clearly an actor with more range like william would have been better james dean certainly proved he knew how to his way through a movie the whole film is slow and goes on for far too long the actors were all too young and 
 let 's hope this is the final nightmare this is the of a good thing gone bad there is still some to be had but only in the most mundane sense had been there for the of this franchise had been on the production staff and produced even i do n't know what she was thinking but this debacle comes complete with the human video game boy and a guest appearance and arnold i wish i had a clue what 
 is my favorite movie i have seen it a number of times do n't remember the count now and every time i just love it this is the best movie of the comedy and performance is amazing all the actors and have done a job you can not stop laughing while watching this movie its just khan and khan have done a great job and acting by was excellent as always the music is inspired from the old movies music 
 i saw this movie last night after waiting ages and ages for it to be released here in canada still only in limited release it was worth the wait and then some i am a very reader of margaret laurence and was excited to see that this novel was being turned into a film i actually ended up the movie better than the novel i liked that the character of was a bit less harsh and that there seemed to

 this movie is a drama about the making of a movie the actor and the actress really ca n't stand each other but we build up to a scene in which they are to have sex she for the first time per script the actress shows little on or off camera in the plot aside from she is in the early scenes on a beach the actor is absorbed and increasingly the direction of the director i could not help 
 the N year old virgin exists in a world i do n't understand a world where an electronics store employee can tell his boss to f off and broadcast of his naked throughout the store and not get a world where it 's really funny to go drunk driving and into other peoples ' cars a world where it seems for a boss to her a world full of and offensive of ethnic minorities and a world without any funny 
 there is absolutely no doubt that this version of is the to ' vision while he collected his royalties from the films produced during his lifetime he frequently made it clear that they were little more than the children of his the film studios ' with casting olympic as was beyond i guess we should consider ourselves lucky that they did not set their sights on prior to this film the most were in comic strips and comic books as 
 even with the low standards of a dedicated fan i found this film to be beyond awful it was a huge disappointment since it was featured as one of the eight films i can only hope the other seven were better i was actually embarrassed for the friends i was able to convince to see this and these are the same friends i made watch the of the man it has every in the book in fact it went out 
 one of the other mentioned that they almost walked out if i had n't been with my wife who wanted to stay i would have left it 's a shame too because i think it could have been a good movie but this is easily one of the worst adapted i 've ever seen it starts out nowhere and it goes nowhere i would say it goes nowhere fast but it really goes nowhere slow painfully slow from time to

 they should make watch this video as and not just for the disturbing final scene in which up and beating a woman with mental problems is apparently a source of comedy about a half hour of this would convince even the to spill the rather than sit through even one more minute of this movie is awful i it because a friend said it was only to find he was talking about the director doing the commentary rather than the

 i thought the river of was a very good N movie with some performances from martin and ian if this were an episode of the series without the it would probably be one of my stories of the i 've always preferred to christian although granted did n't write her as well for much of the series and she did have to endure the plot if you take out the about the and the poorer actors in those scenes then 
 the plot is somewhat original and all the actors did their job pretty well there is a plenty of comic relief too some things do not make a lot of sense the first chase scene why would the not just hide somewhere and wait until the leave the russians actually speak russian without but the cars are extremely strange with models like N years and so the place seems out of time overall if you like you will probably like 
 this is just one of those films which can not justify much of anything that happens these people are going on a the young girl wants to photograph animals there really are no but i guess the hunter guy is the real anyway there are lots of animals and there is lots of driving there is considerable talk but we all know where that is going toward the end there 's lots of action and a rape thrown in somebody 
 the film is essentially an older form final in which several car have their from their bodies and must death who is chasing them the film has its moments and its the idea of being from their bodies is a pretty idea if this movie were with a few good and some special effects it could turn out to be extremely as for the actual film i recommend watching the version the pure version might be too boring to sit 
 it might be that the film i saw was entirely different from the one that the others saw however as the actors are the same i can only think that the cut i saw in europe from the one circulating in the this was the worst movie that i saw the past five years closely followed by the why because in my opinion this director has taken elements from every preceding this one mixed them put the in the wrong 
 this story of ted an american pilot who is the sole of the crash of an allied plane in belgium in january of N is pretty much of a mess the title would lead you to think that it is a story about the belgian armed resistance groups but that seems to be just a backdrop to up a silly love story between ted and the woman who takes ted in 's husband is a committed resistance member but it

 i do not know who is to blame miss or her director but her performance as is almost impossible to watch ben on the other hand does a superior job against all odds as far as i am concerned his character is entirely too and appealing but certainly not shown as greedy enough to put up with 's character 's appears by what can not possibly be understood as 's and lack of grace but rather her there has to 
 did someone find the plot somewhere in the film perhaps it is the thing missing in this exercise of about it is quite surprising that gordon says that a movie without a plot is nothing it is possible that characters have more to say that the own was this phrase in the original plot or the actor decided to send a hint to the director

 just got this in the mail and i was surprised as a big fan of N 's it does n't take much to satisfy me when it comes to these kind of despite the obvious low budget on this movie the acting is overall good and you can already see why was to become on of the greatest actors ever i 'm not sure how this movie is but it sure is a good contribution to the

 this movie should have easily qualified as a best human understanding among may be rather to even try to that a young jewish southern girl could would give shelter to an escaped german prisoner of an amazing portrait of the unhappy young girl for acceptance and love michael gave a remarkable performance as her difficult father and as the ruth gave a performance as an understanding caught up with these the german who is supposedly not guilty of this is 
 brazilian films often get more positive than they actually deserve rather contra against everybody original title which the producers discarded god against everybody got very low grade point average in this it seems to be rejected by female at large actually it is not so i mean as far as violence is concerned its is as it would-be i mean citizens who in fact high-tech equipment who perform murder orders in exchange of is this man is only worry a 
 with full i was not surprised to see that a woman had had a hand in this awful woman 's picture and i mean that in the worst possible way the trouble is it could have been so good if they had only left out the stuff and stuck with the more interesting scenes involving the in early century london when the sound track music is better than the film you know you are in trouble when you fast forward 
 once again proves that he has absolutely no business producing 'd think that after such dismal night at the and he 'd start to get the notion that maybe he does n't know what he 's doing when it comes to movies and many would argue that he does n't know what he 's doing when it comes to television as well trying to make feature films out of that wore out their welcome the third time the were done 
 i just ca n't agree with the above comment there 's lots of interesting and indeed amazing in this one it has an unusual structure and moves well toward a that is notable for it 's effective use of what 's more it the odd of in a very frank way not pulling any in what it shows yet not and the subject matter it has hints of about it as well as and and deserves a place the of 
 i thought that this movie lacked the building dramatic the first movie had this is hard to accomplish when the film takes place over a week the original movie lead up to the final scene over a period of a year and it still was less violent than the one good thing about this film was the movie went by relatively quickly because the plot seemed rushed when 's best friend died there was no mentioned in the movie another

 i consider myself a big fan of low budget movies the more bizarre and the film the more blood and the better and i really fall in love with done if they are done right starts out well enough his at the circus a run at a supermarket an attack of an old lady and his disturbing of a woman 's all set the mood a hot scene when the woman 's daughter and daughter 's at the house when 
 this is one movie not only is it badly acted but it absolutely destroyed the book as well horrible how you could mess up such a classic book is beyond me but they sure did do n't even think about even this 
 right where do i start i can not even imagine to this excuse of a show picture this a school where kids whose parents are rolling in money simply chuck them in there so as to jet around the world themselves it could not get any more than you taught these kids shall not even upgrade them to the term because they hardly even act like were think again about N minutes full of their so-called problems boy troubles and 
 after life is a i did not expect much it 's hard to believe that these films were made by the same man as do you remember bell for instance is two hours of silly with no story the wild and humor of underground seems to have into here it appears that has been going steadily since he started making beginning with black cat white cat which i think was great but already had some disturbing signs of i liked 
 i love dogs and the most interesting character in this movie is a golden he is better looking and more interesting than any of the human characters like many other i have not read the book but i doubt that having done so would change my opinion of the movie it is predictable from the first five minutes on no surprises mad scientists create a monster that gets loose and a age boy and his wonder dog to destroy it 
 this is by far the that has ever aired on tv i own all N seasons on and literally could watch them over and over anyone who does not find this show entertaining and out loud is crazy kevin james is absolutely one of the most out there my and i love going to stand up comedy shows in boston where we live and have seen kevin james twice and his brother gary danny once they are both so and 
 the first time i saw this movie was on a flight between china and los angeles it was a real and made the trip pass with much less than the normal N hour flight i tried to a copy of it without success until i discovered a copy for sale on having now watched it twice i recommend it as good entertainment my only real criticisms are that the choice of english translation words for the is par even by 
 i watched the first episode of the war at home because i thought it was worth replacing arrested development boy was i disappointed it should be clear to everyone that this show was of for life and married with children since they are all similar in plot and overall mood the so called lines are all and even more those lines are n't even funny at all to me they 're more along the lines as being and crude the

 an and lean film the man in the white suit is yet another breath of fresh air in format from studios while i suspect some modern viewers may initially find it i doubt many would fail to be by the expert way the plot the themes and characters are during the film 's great guinness gives another fine in a film perhaps not as obviously as 's inspired kind hearts and from this time he merely plays one character rather 
 great voices lots of and dialogue make this a very good movie the addition of character to the three lead animals gives the story a lot more and meaning particularly the relationship between the older fellow shadow and the young chance the earlier versions of this film were unable to give the animals any real or motive which is done perfectly here field is in anything but really in this film as the proud sassy great contrast between cat and

 any movie with national in the title is absolutely guaranteed to die a death in london england paris france rome italy and anywhere in may be an institution in the u.s. but it is practically unknown in europe to the larger audience national 's european vacation is unlikely to that situation the are just that are not funny clearly chevy chase thinks he 's funny after all miss angelo a lot at his jokes but she 's getting paid for 
 the movie is bad nothing special just a kid movie with no serious thing in it there is though one reason to watch this for the animal talk some of them are so funny in what they say you just ca n't stop laughing so if you want to hear a dog in the dog pound saying i 'm or another animal saying you 're a dead cat walking or many other funny one see it cause there 's no 
 the wooden horse was one of the first great escape stories from world war ii telling the true story of eric williams and others in their escape from iii in october of i really like this film but had to by it on from in england and get it transferred from format in the u.s. i read the book when i was in school after having seen a portion of the film in the early N 's on the drama

 what more can you ask for a great based on one of the plays of the latter half of the century two fine emotional performances by and a realistic vision of war time london a great supporting cast this film takes you on an emotional through loss and if you are in the theatre it is even more effective this is a true N on the rating scale 
 there are so many in the plot it makes you wonder if they knew they had an audience for this and just threw it together i do n't know much about george but i 've seen him in two movies obviously he has been cast as the father mad scientist guy he looks so ordinary i 'm surprised that he ended up in the this is the typical i will create that can be used to fight as an army 
 i went to see this because i have some friends in the but the film moved me beyond what i expected by turning out to be a perfect of holding alex 's strange use of english comedy and on i loved the range it made me want to jump in to an old car and hit the road for the alex plays his guide part perfectly and provides a great to woods ' faced the film shows the positive side 
 obviously with this film going straight to i was n't expecting a lot but this film is so it is the only part of the film that you actually may find funny is before they even get to the island where eddie 's son is out of the by a jet of water and then that 's it why do they bother at all the first christmas vacation with chevy chase was brilliant and this is not they rely on 
 this movie is basically about some in a catholic school that end up getting into trouble because of putting red in one in one of their school and after being for this act they decide to take off to florida for a vacation on their way there they meet up with some guys in a local and decide that they would both meet up with each other in another location later on the end up on a road side near

 this is not the true story it is the possible derived from the events it with death a totally at organized in general and the church in particular and generally provides a world view from which i are intended to walk away richer in their poverty and more hopeful in their trash though performed by a capable cast that anyone would suggest this is a true however is very much false advertising you want the real story rent tale '

 first i am not really a fan of the whole things eating in new ways of film but i am a bad movie so my next door neighbor said he had the worst movie ever this one so we start watching it first and it is recorded on a second the voice of the white doctor is dubbed by a large black man third none of the dialogue makes any sense fourth the scenes though and of poor makeup and 
 if jean 's first film of fate first takes us into the world of the the the lives of the that he will continue to explore it seems only that his second film deals for the most part with the wealthy and the the upper classes and those who are trying to their way put the characters from the first two films together and you have the seeds of his great grand illusion and rules of the game this is 
 so i to watch and only caught the last episode thinking it was the first or second i thought would have at least one more installment to resolve plot points the are left on the plains we 'll have to eat the horses for one thing little is for another what a ending but my biggest complaint if this was the is that the episode had no no big no dramatic even the last fight between blue duck and was 
 is a far from great film from a stage play directed by in the scheme of 's films this is above the level of most of his do n't look now work which is by use of russell as lead actress she 's actually very good here and far from the problem in other films like bad timing and cold as the actress who is russell is very effective portraying her as a but she plays well alongside michael as

 the the classic image of good evil in the form of a struggle of brother against brother the main character lin played by james stewart represents justice and his brother who operates under the of dutch henry brown played by stephen stands for the classic western by his brother for having killed their father the world the story takes place is the classic west where the only way to prevent its from killing each other is to take away their 
 this movie is one of my all time favorite movies and is what made me a fan back in the 's i taped this movie when 's were impossible to do this with and would watch it over and over is just brilliant here and he looks wonderful and has no affecting see sue got married to know what i mean about that i measure all his performances against this one he was so perfectly cast as the cool guy 
 i believe a lot of people down rated the movie not because of the lack of quality but it did not follow the standard hollywood formula some of the conflicts are not resolved the ending is just a little too real for others but the the rich characters and long list of supporters provide is both thought and very entertaining even the is excellent given the urban setting the also is excellent and is a N in my book this 
 japan is in serious trouble have taking of forms and them to their will on top of that the of queen of the is the only thing that stands against this grave threat are the a group of who might just be as bad as the is a retired who five years ago took up theater instead of after killing a innocent child in a battle that 's of the bar scene from till one night by a chance he 
 the killer in the movie does n't wait a second as we see him into a and her to death taking her and arm as he makes his we then get this official looking as if were watching a true story that a number of were committed in the late fall of N in a small looking and hearing ron is by this murder and later when the of local students all women continues his run for state senator is 
 i think i watched this movie but do n't quote me as i may have fallen during watching it as it did n't exactly grip my excitement and at least i know i watched enough of it to know i wo n't be watching it again soon or talk about really totally it would n't even appeal to a six year old it basically had no dramatic impact just turned into comedy that was supposed to be comedy now if 
 i have never read the book a in time to be perfectly honesty after seeing the movie do i really want to well i should n't be reviewing this movie i 'll start off with that next i 'll say that the tv movie is pretty do you know why i say that because i what happens in it i told you it was to be perfectly honest no tv movie will ever be better than do i describe a 
 i truly hate because music numbers just start out of the sudden and usually scenes but this one is completely different it 's simply brilliant plot perhaps is n't any challenge for the viewers but the of people life stories makes this movie 've seen it at least dozen times and still i 'm not tired with the plot characters or music i just love the it 's the only that i 've really wanted to have and most probably

 it 's a real challenge to make a movie about a baby being by wild and the mother being accused of murder funny but against all odds this one succeeds gives the performance of her life but with that comic that keeps you laughing even as a mother struggles with the ultimate about the being by dogs are not your cup of tea you might be uncomfortable watching this and yes it is an odd choice of topic for a 
 i saw this film for the first time last night i have been thinking about it all night and this morning i can not say that it was my favorite film at least not yet i need to see it again the is stunning each shot has a that one would expect in a film that has 's name attached to is always to see de in any picture of rows of orders into the but in this case the 
 space is a vacuum right therefore space also a really bad movie set in space would have twice the power right it started with what could have been a fun 's story in the future there 's a salvage crew that 's sent out to investigate a cargo ship that 's lost in space called the fans of the original novel will assume that this is to be a of set in the future unfortunately short of sharing character names 
 god this movie was so bad i thought i was on drugs in a bad way the character acting is the poorest thing i 've seen in quite some time this movie was more to lord of the it 's a real movie most of the movie appeared to be done on a horrible green screen my favorite part was when they are in the and you can tell there 's no horse they 're from and going about the 
 what is the story what is it on the screen at first i must say do not touch this movie it is for your own best it and really what is the story in the beginning it seems but after ten minutes it all gets worse and that is not all you can hardly see what it is on the screen it is too dark all the not touch 
 so the plot is on shaky ground all right so there are some inserted song dance for example 's concert and 's stage act and leslie ca n't really you know somehow american in paris ' manages to come through it all as a musical largely on the basis of gene kelly 's incredible talent and and the of he seems to be importing into each scene with he needs to because she seems to have a problem with the 
 this movie was so frustrating to watch the split screens do n't allow you to get very involved in the of the actors i was constantly going back and forth watching all these tiny images that i found myself with by the end this is basically a off of the mr. and i was very let down with this film makers attempt to be cool i wish i had walked out like so many other people did 
 it 's true that danny 's the is a with a very predictable plot no particular attempts for or surprises and featuring literally every single the has brought forward over the decades but that does n't necessarily make it a bad film on the contrary my friends and i were surprised by this but nevertheless intense little N 's feature that mainly from a handful of images and a downright brilliant casting the beautiful and ambitious reporter fast and two

 within what a predictable the movie had no character development i felt no any of the characters except may be the small boy and did not care what happened to any of them the movie had so many or elements stolen from other movie was so predictable many times i would be saying to myself let me guess fill in guess happens next i was right even in the opening scene i predicted that the attack on the family was 
 let 's get one thing straight i like much of ' work unlike his other and van he can actually act this film however does little to enhance his reputation it 's not exactly but i am not in any hurry to watch it again either in fact if i never saw it again it would n't bother me there are just of better films out there to waste my on it 's a because with a bit of and 
 this is one of the worst movie i have ever seen it 's a with a rather ridiculous ending i watched this movie hoping for the best and instead found something truly bad the movie two actors that i like very much and antonio sure they had decent chemistry together but for what the movie 's was bad to begin with and the execution just made it even plays taylor a trying to analyze a convicted serial killer whose defense

 we should have been to discover that with only two minutes to lights out we were the only ones there only five others joined before the movie is nothing at all to redeem this movie the acting is awful especially the script is the effects we 've seen a million times the film direction the worst that we 've seen and including the left after N minutes it would have been sooner if my wife had n't gone for a 
 with all the european studios involved in this one you would think you 'd at least get some pretty photography but the local color is kept to a # N is using a russian in order to play a spanish the story is confused there 's a supposed romantic back story that is intentionally confused is she or is n't she a serving no purpose the in the movie are the most stupid to have a serial killer film in 
 i caught this on very late at night nothing else was on so i pretty much had no choice bottom line terrible plot slow waste of good film and actors ' time to make it short do n't even bother with this one it 's too bad we ca n't give as a rating this one really is not worth even a consideration 
 this movie is not very good but does it really matter we all know the for the story and this has nothing new but i love low budget & sci camp so i this one about only thing that anyone remember from this movie is that little made his debut in did the part did n't ask for great acting skills and the direction probably never gave him any chance of providing one anyway little was very and so was 
 this is one of those movies which makes you think would the real american have done the same frankly i do n't think so and he 'd have been right i 'm italian i can not go proud of my country for many reasons but i would n't have for another team the french for example simply because i 'm in love with besides the does n't fall in love desire with a british girl at the end of the 
 say what you want about andy but if his family was even N as as the one in this film well then i guess he could have turned out worse unfortunately the video print of this film contains sex scene originally shot by the distributor to boost the picture 's box office appeal several times during the film 's and silent film music abruptly ends and suddenly for 's actors take over and start doing it to N 's rock

 prior to this film i had only seen two films by director the del N famous fans for its performance from peter and the strip for your killer neither film was a particularly spectacular piece of but both were entertaining in their own special way and the fact that they featured plenty of and did n't hurt massacre however is despite quite a bit of and the odd spot of story about a series of in a hotel where the

 what can i say it was a good movie very different to all the boring we see lately the only thing i would have liked to see a bit more of an ending like when left her husband she was going to cause she fell for her not just her but everything that she is i so wish producers would actually show that sort of ending instead of leaving to it your sort of ending i really hate it when 
 i do n't like do n't understand the attraction i did like this movie positive of with no drugs sex or street violence the plot actually showed stable families the fight are violent as is but not as over the top as rocky films nothing wrong with attempting familiar themes with a different and it 's a good rent

 movie should appeal to southern with 's on and the average bush noble plays the lead in this script for what it is and uses a generous of this and that and the ending which i anticipated to save this story was the biggest leaving me hanging and wondering why it 's a story of cat & mouse or more like vs. n't waste your time unless you like hearing the phone ringing every N minutes and constant and throughout 
 i 've waited to see this movie for a long time and at last i could manage to see it in film festival maybe because i expected too much from this film and that 's why i was slightly disappointed i was not the best movie from korea but still it is really worth subject was nice and the film makes you keep watching without getting though it is long but there are in the movie and you jump from 
 i do n't think it 's necessary to the plot for you because the site and other users have done a job of that already that said here 's my take this is by far the worst movie of N and there have been some really really bad ones i do n't even need to go into detail because there is nothing about this movie bad acting bad plot bad bad special name it if it does n't stand alone 
 as a producer of movies and a harsh critic of such i have to say i loved this movie it is funny and well directed and entertaining hats off to the producers and directors for making a good one i 'll be watching for the next one i gave it a N 
 this film is a third rate attempt at a compelling moody and fails on all three counts it just about managed to keep my attention as the was seen slowly and predictably breaking all the life rules he had set himself at the beginning of the it 's in the last N minutes or so that things really start to a and that 's being generous becomes completely as suddenly new characters appear from nowhere and random and events are

 i this movie for numerous reasons within the first ten minutes of the film i grew extremely disappointed and came to the conclusion that if this movie was going to salvage itself for me at least that it was going to have to pull itself out of the enormous hole it had unfortunately that did not occur the two draws of the movie for me were to see and i do n't know enough about 's work to have been

 bed is a strange movie it 's very as if it had a lot of ideas but lacked the ability to bring them all into one story instead we get various that into their own separate little movies oh sure they eventually meet up in the end but it all seems rather of note is the girlfriend and her troubles at the hospital was this interesting then there were the we are spirits thus we have no elements which leads 
 people seem to be expecting citizen kane here the planet is a movie and as such is good fun and different enough to be enjoyed the director clearly has something to offer not so sure about some of the cast as for the effects ai n't a lot of effects for one would recommend this to a head or anyone who does n't take monster movies too seriously if so watch blue noticed one review saying it had off like

 thought at first this film would be your typical western film however it turned out to be very interesting and kept me right to the very end which turned out very unusual sam had past with james and never sam and would stop at nothing to make sure he caught up with him and paid him back unfortunately barbara susan the portrait of a lady managed to get caught up in this situation and found herself among sex men who 
 under the assured direction of f. gary gray italian job never loses its grip on being cool and fun although the material is and average the film itself is executed and is good the tone could easily have been much heavier considering the but f. gary gray keeps the tone light by good humor and music it is a pleasure to see these guys form a great bond and stick to through and murder while never to have fun this 
 i do n't really know where to start the acting in this movie was really terrible i ca n't remember seeing so many ' in one film that were n't able to act not only the acting was bad the characters were stupid as there 's the action i believe that even children know that when someone gets shot there 's blood involved but when someone gets shot in 'd for ten times there 's no blood at all well 
 right then he 's absolutely brilliant but you must be and quick to understand his humor he covers attacks all sorts of topics such as the first moon landing movies and those of you are to this is n't for you while some of us with and periods he uses the also if you ca n't at yourself never watch this you will feel the i 've watched his other stuff and even saw him perform live and this is 
 the first thing you meet when you study is because this philosophy is a fake one there 's a need to use to assess the thought 's movie probably his focuses on the the of the the historical event and 's alliance we will see almost nothing some military march some some scattered voices our two heroes are not invited for the of is essentially this is the golden rule a never better on her cushion whose world amounts to 
 i can see why this film was for best live action short as it was constructed even if you do n't particularly like the blues though to me this sounded much more like jazz you can easily appreciate this film it is simply very well made though for the life of me i ca n't see why director only got to direct one film this one in other words the film is and yet the director did n't get any 
 if i could give it a zero i 'd change my mind and give it a instead absolutely horrible movie with no movie plot does n't make sense of what is happening just plain boring please do n't waste your money on this one this movie could have done so well if it truly the real killer 's story but i did n't feel anything but while watching it do yourself a favor and rent some classic movies instead its 
 too bad i really like and gary but the director failed to put this together there 's a lot of action a lot of promise but it all comes off the director did n't do his job promising action comes off so much seems in a desperate attempt to save the film this version of the rage credits it as N simply is n't worth the time to watch it another director would have done a better job 
 michael jackson is the greatest singer and the greatest that ever lived and this film proves it it is brilliant to watch and the dance is when michael turns into a is a bit of an on part the first time you watch it and vincent price 's adds to the fear when all the a rising from their if you like this then i suggest you buy michael jackson 's ' which has the film then the making of 
 i 'm an of 's films especially N 's henry fool grim is a to that film and has a similar style and sense of humor the plot however is completely different grim played by the parker tries to track down her missing husband 's and finds herself amid and the supporting cast most of the folks from the first film as well as jeff and a return from is excellent and the film has lots of surprises the director 
 this was like watching the of a up and coming movie except that there was no movie coming up the film is so and obviously as to be almost the subject of this film is over a very short time frame and frankly nothing much actually happens in the N odd minutes of screen time i was hoping for the definitive australian film about our soldiers in and how they fought against incredible odds in awful is most certainly not 
 this short film N minutes based on a short story by william takes us back to small-town tennessee in december two brothers one about N and one about N are looking for birds eggs obviously a huge collectors item for boys in the south around this time well the japanese bomb harbor and the older brother pete decides to he gives his prize egg to his little brother and heads off to show more and to his little well is 
 saw this movie at the vancouver film festival and thought it was deadly smart and cast was rock solid great work by anne moss baker tim nelson and up and i found myself thinking about the movie for days after seeing dennis robert and andrew in a lot of political but did n't you over the head with world they created had and made sense there is a spirit to this is guaranteed to cure it 
 well in contrast to other comments previously written i have to say that the only good thing about this film is the fact that one guy in it looked a bit like which reminded me of my youth i have no idea how it won any and although i 'm sure a great deal of effort went into making it it was all as the final outcome is one which of early N 's foreign soap the plot was the 
 i was N when i first saw this on tv on a friday night i remember the full page ad in the tv guide with the picture of the amazing how some things stick in your mind after N years anyway if your a kid who likes monster movies this one is entertaining enough especially with boone and at each other special effects are no but its worth the hour and a half if you find it somewhere on late 
 well they sent it on tv between midnight and N N am it seems like the right time to watch it and then go to bed no it was not really living up to my expectations i think the concept is good because the film then gets closer to what 's really happening between the involved characters when you cut all the unnecessary effects and music out but then again this concept requires some interesting action between the can not 
 this film is all right fairly silly and to be taken but what i ca n't stand are the numerous heroes and that boy 's comment near the end look they all look the same is n't that by far passing the good taste standards i thought it was as were the acts by some of the people in this film i 'm not saying it wo n't happen like that but in on all the like that makes my 
 as a local performer i thought that what broadway producers are looking for and it a small bit of the acting population although my did not win but came in second i enjoyed myself to them and seeing what i liked and where i could improve as a brought in because she is the obvious link between the broadway production and television sang from the movie devoted al because these will be included in the new agree with the earlier 
 barbara is a sheer in this comedy about a invited to spend christmas with a popular magazine writer 's family at her farm in connecticut the problem is she has no husband baby or farm as she writes about in her column and she ca n't even cook her wonderful being provided for her by her good friend uncle owner of a restaurant in new york get even more complicated when her strict publisher boss invites himself along for christmas 
 a which attempts to be both the foreign and the but just ends up being a mix of many different kinds of humor none of them followed very successfully barbara the bond girl from the spy who loved me has only two or three brief scenes what a waste 
 i highly recommend this film set in the future of N paris it is in most respect a classic film script lady in sister trying to find her honest fighting everyone it being and combines a pretty good with interesting innovative the film might you of city in look but it has an even sharper even more novel look that i found really compelling each frame each seems like it could have been pulled from the desk of a skilled 
 a terrible controversial film winner of the teddy in berlin N de turned out to be a the actors are all well they are not exactly actors the film tried to be a high bet but ends up being a doubtful bet it stays in the of two guys and a guy whose is gone it has no purpose nothing to do with the presented in other films before night falls N by technically the only thing that works is 
 and rogers at the of their popularity in N americans thought of the navy as a place for song and dance was still a few years away fred and dance up the plot is decent but who by the way notice the roles for and a glamorous load of irving berlin including the famous let 's face the music and dance in that scene 's heavy dress fred in the face during one of her and almost him fred insisted 
 the can come up as a good idea in some movies here it is a total the total mess begin with the story a wants to shoot a light comedy with a female character she is and no men could resist to dive and and her she is all the more looking as if butter would n't in her movie does away in its own being at his best white trash only please 
 this is n't exactly a great film but i the writers and director for trying something a little different the film 's main theme is fate and small seemingly things that can greatly change the future in some ways this me of the film sliding doors though instead of focusing on one random event seemingly random stuff happens repeatedly and each one helps build to the conclusion plus an odd guy seems to understand all this and he talks about 
 as a fan of looking further into the phenomenon that is school this film took an interesting and different approach to the idea presented as a series of video made by the two troubled men i can not refer to persons who kill as boys or the months of preparation leading to zero day the for the day on which they will attack the film tries to present the situation from the opposite end of the gun it seems intent 
 warning movie warning the day before christmas some case decided he 'd us by sending this movie as on tv what in name was he thinking this movie is filled with awful humor acting jokes and a disaster of a plot line plays the role as eddie johnson eddie is a brain dead person who 's of even the tasks he was fired because he was as a brick but the company he worked for was sorry for it so 
 down is not a great movie but then again very few are so if your looking for entertainment instead of great wisdom this is a great movie without the no sharp or violence this light comedy about a bunch of who are assigned to a they are set to fail their tasks so that a general can get his extra star they must take on the entire with it 's nuclear but they are and this is a comedy so 
 although the notorious page is well acted and shot is is at best a notes version of 's the film mainly centers on her work with irving and the brother and sister team who produced the bulk of her most famous photos it does not detail her life after aside from her it cites the real page by richard foster as a source but it 's later years of mental illness and in a mental hospital the narrow focus of 
 first and i wish to aim a big & mean the crew who were actually stupid enough to reveal the identity of this movie 's killer on the back of the cover the just who 's the person responsible for the massacre on day for 's i do n't care how terrible or how predictable an N 's can be just who did it the whole point so a word of advise in case you also purchase the containing day 
 i saw this on a with the english i thought the story was good but there were times when some of the were grossly this took away from the film as did the fairly musical score which really me throughout the entire movie if the musical score was improved i could the few scenes then the film would be much much better 
 this is the single worst movie i have ever seen i can not express how bad it is i wanted to kill myself several times through this experience just to have the pain end i recommend instead of seeing this movie you in acid then you will at least know a fraction of the pain without all of the had such high expectations when i read the back of the case and when in the beginning it added that was 
 the for this movie promised and this movie delivered exactly what was promised good fun with lots of very good looking naked if you were expecting a major hollywood movie with major stars budgets and money shots you will be very if you are a fan of the old b movies with unknown but very good looking young stars that act well given the material some but surprisingly well done special effects and very tight naked bodies this movie is 
 a very film and one which was having seen the a number of whole thing looks from the efforts of the upper class to distance themselves from the to the lower class just trying to keep their heads above the the film the spirit of the century lee miller plays extremely well though the part does not exactly stretch him and robert seems a little wasted on miller 's real star of the show was undoubtedly ken who plays chance 
 this is N hour and N minutes of pure in this movie even the gun baldwin uses it was sent to recycling by armed forces worldwide in the and is now only used by bank and military i had known this movie was this bad i would rather watch N episodes of saving the no drive and no feel watch the it 's more than this sorry excuse for a movie this movie does n't deserve a ' on the 
 this is a of a film violence simon and green looking power plant and an add to this if you have n't seen this i can highly recommend it maybe not quite as good as bottom but not far you have never seen a man by the nose on two then what are you waiting for buy this did n't even see the twist at the end coming when it turns out that and eddie are both N egg 
 this movie is recommended only for it will relieve them by putting them to sleep might also enjoy it but for anyone else including fans of the what a the ancient plot is of return of the and this film is just as but is no bruce lee so enter the is an even worse film until now this is the second the offensive comedy party was the first film i gave to 
 i saw this movie last night on hbo & did n't expect to get i usually fall when i watch hbo but it happened & you will too it 's a N winner about a murder of an elderly female tourist in florida and subsequent investigation arrest & trial of a N year old this movie today & get a feel for how we have as a society this film was most of an you 'll be moved to 
 as the film begins a warns us the is so you might die of and if such happens a free is guaranteed well i do n't think any one has died of from seeing this film but a few may have died of the is the sort of movie that makes ed wood look based on the famous francis story is about a wealthy but nervous woman who a man whose first wife died under circumstances once installed in his

 i did watch all of the film through to the ending even though i felt so angry at what i saw i felt that the director was for attention and the only way he could achieve this was to be as as possible since i have lived in the i have come to love this country but this film british young people in the worst way there is nothing to be said but avoid it it will make you angry 
 before he became defined as charles in the thin man series william played another named the supporting cast is strong in this early and 's star quality is evident mary who eight years later would be defined by her portrayal of does a good job here as the featured woman who finds herself in the middle of it all 
 for me this is another one of those films that i got to see off of the los angeles based z channel when it was in service and it was another one of those movies that i saw when i was young and learned that there was a world out there one i did not want to to los angeles and getting to watch international became quite the guilty pleasure of mine and to date no premiere channel programming has

 possible i thought pitch black to be quite with some nice effects i liked the larger although they are n't a patch on the aliens from the series it had quite a good atmosphere which i felt diesel helped contribute thing which kind of me was how it if the planet has three and is in almost where did the come from to form clouds and therefore rain i liked the fact that died at the end it reminded me

 i was waiting to see this movie from a long time it 's gave a fair idea about the content and when i finally saw it i really find it was quite well made most of the conventional romantic movies end with the finally getting married or start of with a happy life after marriage but there is really a great adjustment needed for this transition from an old life to a new and life this is what this movie 
 i sort of liked this movie its atmosphere which was real like and its approach even at times reminded me of in the movie its first N minutes or so it 's really nice and done in a good old way with the right camera and use of light it does n't mean instantly that this movie is a brilliant one though but its solid enough to consider this a good late movie entry it 's definitely a better movie 
 yet another of of dollars 's of 's suggested by the novel harvest ' one is strictly a taken as that it is rather the direction is the acting full of the limitations of its ' photography weakness of the film is in the decision to the ' plot to a from 's upon a time in the west ' although directed both ' and ' his behind the two films could n't be anymore different the with no name 
 do n't get me wrong i enjoy movies character studies and foreign movies unfortunately i could n't enjoy this one complete lack of plot and characters that you ca n't dislike enough to hate but you ca n't enough to me distant was like watching the floor of a reality show all of the scenes which were deemed too which would normally not make the final cut were the only scenes included a camera in my apartment with two of 
 this film has some of the greatest and quotes ever assembled in one film the plot is somewhat lacking but the are enough to make up the difference this is a movie for all ages that is sure to please as a art form it is highly entertaining and with major stars like grant and douglas how could you go wrong and such as this has long been undervalued and is very difficult to a good example of this is 
 here italy i write from venice why the abc should have given it a chance to build an audience the cast davis campbell scott jay and is one of the best i 've seen in recent we need more shows like this that makes viewers feel like they are individuals not i hope that abc will reconsider its decision or another station will pick it up please sign petition to abc please sign petition to abc 
 i absolutely loved this film i do not at all to all the other comments i have read about it i was completely through every second i found the story the acting intense and the direction i would literally jump every time the phone would ring close to the end of the movie even though there was nothing scary about the story itself i was on edge through the whole movie and for the rest of my evening i found 
 this movie turned out to be better than i had expected it to be some parts were pretty funny it was nice to have a movie with a new plot 
 well what can be said about a comedy that features neither nor comedy there are no characters in the film but much too many plot lines all and mostly computer generated creatures look bad a bit like disney versions of without a the walking dead are the biggest apart from the title the shall look like the dead in ' movie but are far removed they just look like bad actors with of plastic and bull 's blood plot lines 
 john candy 's performance in once upon a crime is possibly his best ever it 's been my movie since it came out i spent N years searching for it that 's how good it is if you disagree well that 's your opinion enjoy the movie 
 despite the on the cover of the version i borrowed this film was a disappointment yes it is far more realistic than other war films of the period for the and frustration of the but unfortunately one comes away from it thinking that 's all there is to this movie there is no plot and the dialogue is it 's not that a good war film needs to have a battle scene every five minute one of the best world 
 this movie has an outstanding acting by and a stunning by the this is in my opinion the best brazilian movie ever made the movie was with child from the ' the brazilian the children were n't actors and were by in the city of de the story is about the criminal children that are arrested in the prison that looks much worse than the children are constantly and beaten by the unfortunately this is not in brazil it does 
 it is incredible in that it succeeds in being terrible on so many levels the script the acting the and the choice of cast are all the sets and language are also utterly awful in an odd way i actually enjoyed this film once i had accepted that it was n't going to be any good it seems a shame that people would spend so much time and effort producing something so poor when really they could have made something 
 i 'm sick of the open mind argument i 'm generally quite but this sort of line is basically made by people who enjoy things that should not be enjoyed you know what there is a reason so many people are by this and just because someone out there is n't does n't make it less so there is after all a reason for the existence of the feeling of and no amount of open mind or pushing the should 
 why oh why ca n't anyone make a decent film out of a legendary tale this is the second of i 've been disappointed with in a year but i have to say the previous version & gerald butler was far superior to this that one was only a little disappointing this one is a mess what me most was it the plot elements they added in for no particular reason human love interest or the bad or the of

 i was a guest at the sept. of eddie and was surprised with the story the great acting and the i found it hard to believe that all this talent can be found in an independent film powerful performances by uncle and morris eddie the supporting cast was full of and amusing characters this film me of one of those movies that you will look back on in N years and discover that it launched many actors into much like

 i enjoyed this movie so much that i watched it twice and that is something to say about a the musical score and sound are absolutely stunning as you might expect from an production even though it is shot for those huge theaters it looks and sounds wonderful on my home system in fact this would make a perfect to your subject is also so it is about mario and his son michael i was already a fan of mario

 i purchased this video quite thinking that the cover looked quite nice and it was nice but the movie is trash i can handle i sometimes even enjoy a good b must die ' is a classic example of how entertaining the can be but this was just scenes were broken up too by good cheap and entertaining dream this movie has very little to offer 
 this movie to be a character study of some have been into assuming that because is the film is deep actually considering the material it is surprisingly and with no substance why is the main character the way she is you wo n't find out from the script for a better treatment of the same theme and a more entertaining movie try 's de 
 i this movie because i am a huge fan i figured it could n't be that bad boy was i wrong at the N minute mark i was the others to let me the out and it back to the rental store but they refused they it had to get were wrong this movie was lacking everything the actors delivered their lines with as much as a rock the plot was ridiculous and i was that hollywood assumed people were 
 i got this from a friend who got it from someone else and that probably keeps going on even the cover of the looks cheap as is the entire movie and fights with delayed sound effects some of the worst actors seen in my life a very simple plot it made me my hurt with very few financial resources i must admit it looked pretty professional seen as a movie it was one of the N in a dozen waiting

 because ' would be the only word in existence to describe the intentions of these film makers where do you even begin in a of b i 'm going to start with the awful acting of nearly everybody in this movie that nearly does not belong in that sentence i ca n't think of even one character who was portrayed well although in all fairness it would be nearly impossible to these zero characters in a successful way still the

 this series has recently been and can be seen at least within britain via presumably there is some hope that the series may eventually become available more widely the problem is that this series was followed by the series the wars of the that had a similarly cast and which has been available to cable tv or at least the market the two series are quite different in the wars the plays through extensive and shifting of scenes an age 
 review may contain some i 'll make this review short and sweet i bought this movie from best buy because it sounded interested and had some top actors in it like kevin and morgan freeman how bad could it be right well it 's pretty bad justin plays a journalist who across a case that may lead to corrupt at edison 's police force cool is a within the force on a special force team called first response assault tactics

 this is one of the worst movies i have seen recently when a man says that he wishes he had a power of being able to pleasure himself i pretty much consider the movie to be in the of N year old male the bed room scene was over the top and reduced an intimate moment into a of biological functions to passing gas in public from the first every other scene was a discussion about how little sex they 
 i thought this movie was terrible i 'm chinese so i thought everything was totally wrong many of the facts were incorrect the only thing right about chinese history in the movie was when wendy 's mother explained to her husband about the that i also thought the fight scenes were very and fake many of the actors and were not very great some of the jokes that were supposedly funny were really stupid i think this movie should receive 
 la al is an awful is only a of scenes without a clear is also very bad despite the presence of a good actor like el but something is really in this movie talking about of women scenes are very rare in arab even in this days i really the director and the actors for their we want to see more of this style in egyptian movies but with better quality the reasons that led me to vote this film 
 this has to be one of the worst films i have ever seen without a doubt the only thing interesting in this film is the appearances from some great directors and king himself the film has a great but falls apart about N minutes into the story i did like in this film and think she could have a very good career in film 
 if you listen to the then you know what 's going on with split i found that watching the film under the influence of helped to deal with from job the plot was only important from second to second the acid helped to with the sounds and general pace of this do n't bother writing about something out of your 's reach there just is n't enough of these great independent attempts at expression at it 's most raw level 
 this is about the worst movie i have ever seen this movie does match the quality of such movies as they & fever but even those had name actors where this one fell short the eye candy of this movie looked to be a N woman with a bad face lift just an example of the quality i would have rated this movie in the negative if possible i have to tell you that the men were not bad to 
 i tracked the trip two years ago on the now i 've seen the film what a ride and what a trip to finally get to know such a funny and spirit and what a crew to listen to laughing from being in the water at panama city to see his of being too close to in louisiana the wonder in his eyes as he rode in a hot air balloon the excitement of through some the bet to eat 
 the of the plot is enough to one in and create about the outcome however ultimately the feeling that remains is that the producers of the movie to end it if the intention was to create a perpetual circle occasionally done in the zone it was too sloppy to view as a positive effort 
 and kept falling if you want to see miles around in a by all means rent this movie if not please do n't bother with was this supposed to be set in the ice age the iron age the steel age or the age of reason what was the reason for the black on the guy dressed up as khan was that really supposed to be khan if had access to so much advanced technology and science why did we 
 there is nothing original or in this film the acting is average images are the writing lacks and the scenes are very basic something close to a N N a is used to turn the film into a drama we watch partly because we want to know who dies the various characters each have a problem and the film shows how bad each problem is for them but only as a way to get them each to a place where 
 shore leave is mostly an average star nothing wrong with the episode though i simply think that this is not the best representation of what the show had to offer to fans it is entertaining nothing more however i 'm glad to see that a tv show of this type had enough good sense to take a break from serious conflicts in this episode kirk decides to grant his crew some time off and a landing party is down to 
 this movie is so mild i tried not to expect anything greater from this film but still it was a big disappointment the basic idea of the story is interesting and potential this could have been so much better the characters are really simple no at all it 's a shame that previously performers and did n't make the already poor characters any better the director just do n't get the involved at all with this piece of the the 
 this is truly one of the most awful movies of all time it 's badly acted and teeth watched for about an hour waiting for some kind of drama to before there was n't any the shot on a string budget was particularly painful these have to be the worst day for night shots since plan nine from outer only barely feature is the ' around the with a plastic cat basket how scary is that and i did like 
 largely monster film from the features truly awful special effects the in question is a giant that would make jim want to kill himself i just saw the movie last thursday and i ca n't even tell you who was in it that 's a bad sign i 'm told that when the movie audiences it off the screen and that was in the when standards in special effects were much lower basically i should have walked out of the 
 unless you understand excess this movie wo n't really mean much to you an attempt was made to a bit of into a cold and bleak period consumed by alcohol and drugs it does n't does her big number her voice is so obviously dubbed it is the producers could at least have gotten someone that sounded like that has been playing on television lately is far superior and gives a much view of that period of our one with 
 i remember watching this for the first time in the N 's as a man i 've read the reviews on this trash and i find myself by the voting this movie does not deserve four stars this movie is not better than has its own problems do n't get me wrong this movie should be banned just for its own so many so many so much poor i can not think of one quality of this this is not 
 this one features all the bad effect of prior 's movies but is so nasty and that it is difficult to give this piece of any feature unless you plan to in the this one oh and even if you do avoid it at all costs 
 a couple of men are on a island they are then captured by an count who lives there with a small group of while in the castle lives the count 's unfortunate of is pretty much a job of a movie the actors all through the film while an score continually plays in the background the various of action are all in an way in fact the film in general is completely it just seems to drag on and on 
 when a qualified is released from prison his officer has found him a job working at a big city bank when some of the crime from his past learn of his position they plan to exploit it and the bank is at first because he really wants to go straight but when a twist of fate happens begins to think one should n't look a gift horse in the known as the bank others this is a piece that is 
 he has n't yet this is crude student politics made into drama it needs the to buy into a series of N that a british could be swung from being basically right of to being far left N that all debate in the media and the general public is unanimously ended and that the new prime minister 's only critics are civil big business and the americans naturally N that this radical socialist can solve all union economic and social 
 there were movies before this one and indeed the likes of were an obvious influence on it but the red circle is more than just another entry in an and with this film director has managed to create something that both on the surface and gives its audience something to think about being cool is just as important a feature of the modern crime movie as guns and and that with this film in the tone of the film is 
 macy and were as great as usual was n't bad either what 's her name was as pretty as usual it could have been a good movie to bad the plot was it was completely predictable and the first N minutes the rest of the movie was laid out like a child 's by numbers routine the characters were stock pieces of cut out there was nothing new or interesting to say and that completely the acting which was a 
 the is a great movie not merely because of the images of its nearly title character but because it features a real message it is in many ways a film the is helped by solid performances from the entire cast the two romantic leads steve and bring surprising and to the proceedings they are but very young people and it 's very easy to root for is a movie and its characters cause trouble mainly out of not out of 
 can anybody do good films besides i mean really looked by N standards and even by N toy story standards or maybe they spent all their budget on whatever their the story truly did is a a that is down a toilet i know seems but then the the ways of london to an extent throw in a promise of and an evil and you get a attempt at would like to say something me maybe the in the movie 
 to me happens to be a good a bit slow moving especially around the middle of the series but over all now before anyone on my case and calls me a i will admit that i have watched all of the original N and N the team and will admit that there were a few problems with the story telling and a few characters may seem to be to the original 's but this is an universe show based on 
 there are many reasons i 'm not a fan of fact based films but more than any other is how the give themselves creative license over the story if they have such great then why not use that talent to make something original otherwise stick to the facts this could have been an movie if only they had done just that ed was an human being it 's been said if you were to take michael and wrap them into 
 i ca n't remember many films where a of a hero was so funny throughout leslie is such the of a hero that he 's too to be by a i had the good luck to see it on a big screen and to find a video to watch again and again 
 i would probably say this was on a par with films like 's rain and that sort of film although this is probably a bit better made i love N 's and this has most of the elements that make up other movies i like so it was pretty easy to enjoy a family on their vacation across a small town where the people seem to be by some sort of seems like the children have been after an initial 
 yes the movie was that boring and after a certain point i was wanting the to eat these people just so we could get the movie over plot is that three take a fishing tour up a river in a little boat where the fishing guide on a gun he says he just does it for insurance purposes all the have been out of this river he is immediately by a the then get up a tree getting picked off 
 it was definitely worth i do n't regret that but also it was kind of ordinary something that i would expect from a movie titled like that love story was nice to watch was involved but nothing surprised or spooked me shooting tough guys etc ai n't worth it any more 
 one of the requirements of science at least before it starts to become is that it be somewhat i would think that an bomb would do considerably more damage than for what it was intended but i 'll leave that to the who might have seen solar is a crisis the earth is facing because solar are getting totally out of hand they 're getting close to earth so much so that it 's become hot as if the entire 
 why does c thomas do these movies cruise 's one time does a huge blockbuster of and follows with this do i start here production values i 'll start with the good stuff the look and feel of some of the scenes in this movie are not too bad to be honest the are in spots and the direction not too terrible a series of scenes that could have been put in any order you like throughout the movie the 
 having been familiar with 's the for a good while both in its original book form and in its disappointing film this was interesting stuff the proves almost a mirror image at times set in a slightly less distant period for the main part featuring exposure of the british class system and containing a set piece sports match takes the place of that reveals rather a lot about in its character focus you do not exactly get to ' lady 
 when i read the reviews of i thought it was that confusing to be sure i went to watch the film and what do you know it 's a of the singer several scenes have been changed to suit the whole of but the rest of it is a direct lift from the N hollywood hit is no to but this is one so poor that it me just to watch it i so much watching this and i realized 
 a few years ago i saw the of green by the same director my feelings about both films are in fact the same shot but slow and boring i saw this film in a and left after half an hour could n't stand it anymore how can one make an interesting film about people who are constantly telling each other how happy they are and how perfect their lives are i had a fantasy about a forgotten american still around 
 i loved this movie to be very fair the movie starts off very slowly with none of the characters being sympathetic it continues in this way for a good half of the if you 're patient you 'll be greatly what the first half of the movie lacks in character development is adequately for in the second half it 's a bit like riding a roller a slow climb to off with and then speed and turns and a few 
 i first saw this short when i bought a random of short films a while ago this is the only short on the i liked but i do n't just like it i love it if you spend any amount of time with me you will see it it is beautiful simple and no bells no it could have been done with a but do n't get me wrong the is elegant and this person clearly spent plenty of time 
 and michael are a married couple that are cheating on each other has a in the hospital and michael a that does n't satisfy him the two with their but manage to to each other in the 's not a whole lot to this particular short the direction is and dramatic which is good the acting is but the story leaves a little bit to be why exactly do we care about these two people it 's a little hard 
 who really wants to see that violence sex for such a long time i do not want to but i always stayed true to my philosophy to watch any movie as bad as it may be this was the hardest right after next friday 's basically just how can you possibly call it anything else the story of a roman as an excuse for and & a it 's realistic they have been like this fine but why bother us 
 it 's nothing more than a weird that i decided to watch on the anniversary of the day in june N when president 's ordered us forces into the korean war you see is set largely at air force base in california in the years when it was being used as a staging post for soldiers being shipped out to fight in korea but you 'd need to do your own research to know this because not once during the 
 i have only seen in two other films girl N and do n't really remember her but she did a great job as a girl who posed for pictures because it made people really did n't think what she was doing was wrong even when she left the business and found her photos she made were certainly by today 's standards and it is funny seeing men with cameras get all excited and politicians on the of david good night 
 i liked the movie a real lot wanted to see it just for but the plot and story were ok too a very cool change in plot when you least expect it 
 times are tough for town gangs rule with an iron and for reasons mostly unknown mainly due to embarrassing writing the gangs want a street kid to join the gangs so they beat him up everyday however due to the presence of an olympic world 's actor named hope is on the way town is seriously one of the most message movies ever made and i 've seen my share it seems to consist of the idea that all gang 
 i understand this movie was made on a very low budget but that is no excuse for the that is the of fire queen the were all done on budgets and poor special effects yet they still managed to create by adding some women and a good sense of humor the dark and beautiful landscape gave the potential to be a very good low budget and film but the makers completely this opportunity by using extremely poor effects and characters 
 this movie is really i saw it as an N year old and even then i thought it was pretty ridiculous i would only recommend this film to kids under the age of i really did n't care for it but i do think that it answers some very good questions that kids need to be aware of such as N does money buy N should i lie to my parents about things i think they would n't approve of 
 first let me state that i do not believe in god if you want to use the word fine but i do n't like that word since it describes what i 'm not not what i am but i this the production values were damn near the extremely shaky and whole thing seemed to be an exercise in brian 's production values were terrible and brian is clearly an director at best the sounded like he just over the film 
 i have seen a lot of stupid movies in my life a lot but this is without a doubt the worst one ever i usually like movies if they are somewhat entertaining but i ca n't even think of one good thing about this movie i like for 's but has horrible acting music throughout the whole thing and even the sex scenes i would have to compare the of this movie to the likes of master the toys or 
 absolutely one of the worst movies i 've seen in a long time it starts off badly and just is in a role and leo struggles with what is essentially a character the only with any enthusiasm is tom who it up as a and goes completely with his role the script is dire the acting horrible and it has plot big enough to drive a bus through it is also the most movie i have ever seen 's character 
 does the opposite here she keeps growing and growing i did n't detect any though the incredible shrinking man and other movies of its during the period were about radiation nuclear war and other 's growth is the result of an who operates this computer but i like some of his movies with but though this is a pretty bad movie he does fine without him and green is an excellent plays the town big shot he is 's father 
 this movie was not very good in my opinion while not a complete waste of an hour and a half i did n't have to pay $ for it it just was n't very scary there were parts where i jumped and a few scenes but overall only someone easily frightened would consider this movie overall writing and acting were very weak the characters never or grew as people even at the end the lead guy whatever his name was 
 i kind of feel like a i feel like i 'm the only one who saw through this fake film i watched it three times once with commentary and i found myself getting at all the all the times the screen just blacks out and worst of all i feel the film never really anything yes the dies but he did n't really seem at peace with the town that gave him so much or with himself that and he 
 i saw this movie only after hearing about it for years to say the actual experience proved a bit but still leads a wonderful cast in a if through industrial is the familiar tale of the woes of the perfect everyday product remember the car that runs on water remember the promise of nuclear energy in this case it 's a fabric that does n't wear out or even get of course fabric manufacturers and their workers are at the 
 what can i say i think i have to write alert and then reveal they used the a lot in this movie like in every two sentences i did not like this movie at all too much hints on sexual and cheating and that was totally out the window i gave this movie N and two of those points are for 's movements on the dance floor 
 this as everyone knows it 's based upon some insurance commercials what no one knows is why those commercials were amusing on first at best hardly for a series the talking that 's another story now that would make for an intriguing series and why on earth did abc as reported in the press actually agree to buy the character rights from for this after all the idea of struggling in the modern world is hardly unique to tv phil 
 i think one true thing is one of movies to date her of a dying woman is perfect i have recently lived this movie and it touched me on more levels than i could have is the greatest actress to have ever walked the earth 
 alert this review contains major do not read on if you plan to see this from the amount of votes this got my vote was the fifth one very few people know or care who is well back in the late professional was pretty decent an 's federation called the professional association opened it was a great league and was one of the names on the i always thought she was one of the best people the had in terms 
 after seeing forever hollywood it would be natural to want to see a john waters film at least one get to say that they have joined the of who have experienced the unique of perhaps the best known director it 's worth the effort and is a lot better than and there is a certain about his films which his find 
 a of the N silent film based on the N novel by maurice the series would be made into numerous plays films and tv series in the the us and france over the years this N version the brothers john as the duke and lionel as they would also star together in grand hotel dinner at eight and several others over the next couple years karen shows up in the duke 's bed during a party in this code film 
 this movie has some things that are pretty amazing first it is supposed to be based on a true story that in itself is amazing that multiple would hit the same town at night in the nebraska i wonder if the real town 's name was close to which is the town 's name in the movie there is an nebraska but there is also a town that starts with does show the moving on record in the the seen 
 this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the is the worst i have seen it you the fish is badly made and some of its shots are repeated a thousand times in the film a truly truly bad film 
 if you like his show you might be a little disappointed this movie has some very funny moments and the are pretty constant but none are very or as funny as the things on the show the beginning is really really silly and funny and a great start yes does make a you are a fan then watch it if you do n't know him or do n't like him then do n't bother 
 when i ordered this from blockbuster 's i had no idea that it would be as terrible as it was who knows maybe i 'd forgotten to take my add that day i do know that from the moment the cast drove up in their station in their late wide and hair i knew that this of the era was glory bound for the first of just how bad things were to be was the at the beginning trying to 
 my story from from the ' jones was born to play the part of the steve seen him before in & cash i can state this actor never got the proper credit he a husband takes in his wife showing an interest in a young worker he 's just you know when finds out there 's be hell to pay the young worker ted receives an beating from leaving him how is a blind supposed to work a to black 
 ever since midnight ' i have been on the for films with hoffman and have mostly not been disappointed ever since ' i have been on the for films with and have mostly not been disappointed she gave a performance really one of her best in 's decision ' and i her up in out of africa ' that these two actors came together over N years ago for ' was definitely a very good idea the result is an 
 peter by nature of appearing in and films often gets an unfairly high proportion of bad reviews usually from casual observers who saw ten minutes of the film having into it through well i 've just read all the other N reviews for this film and am to see not a single bad word said about the mile that should be enough to have you out to buy this film peter won an for his role in this film and 
 how bad can it get this was seriously bad not in terms of the which was mainly but in acting atmosphere and story was the character of the main lead was a total joke within a few nights of jones he starts to become ' to the point of when his girlfriend are all new york this and weak his character development had absolutely no or point and by the very end you 'll be laughing out loud at the 
 we often see movies about things going on in politics but i still recommend city hall in a role he was born to play al stars as new york 's mayor who has to deal with the shooting of a boy but it turns out that nothing that he does will really have any effect in this movie the characters are as as we would expect of anyone involved in a political scandal no matter how much you trust any 
 so i 'm looking to rent a and i come across this movie called game ' it stars james woods and cuba jr and has the of a taught political well worth a look then or so i was i game has just about the most ridiculous plot i have ever had the of now being something of a i ca n't really into it as i would like without ' it for those who have yet to experience this 
 i the photography the the and often unlike one comment the lighting what was lacking for me was a found it often badly and at times difficult to follow my version was N minutes shows one at possibly the cuts and did n't help i any films that escape from the hollywood but this left me disappointed miss was and the performances were all fine i just wanted a little more dialogue if anyone would like to see another film 
 we saw this in a bargain basket at the local for the reading all the all over the cover saying how it is and it also had a really good established cast we thought this must a great we bought took it home it in the player sat back and waited for the to begin and waited and waited and waited a bit N minutes later although it felt more like N hours the credits rolled and that was the 
 i thought this was an utterly film the story seems to be a of john waters 's greatest gift is his ability to find beauty in unexpected places edward does well in the lead but the best performances are by his mink a and of all people hearst i think the are way off base on this one they seem to be taking 's worst valuation of his work as when i think the film pretty clearly states that he 
 this is an movie and if you have n't seen it you should go to the video store right now and rent it first off the cast is not only does it have current stars like and bob but it also has your stars of like judge it also has numerous by actors like jon ted and jamie lee second off the story was quite good also it was interesting how they took a plot for a movie and almost 
 this episode the past few years i have watched all episodes of next generation and and am now watching enterprise am enjoying this series until this episode i at the screen in at the destruction of character and entertainment it is more like an attempt at does not build the characters but throws them out on a and leaves the audience it does little to build the this was ever allowed to go to air me was it the writing 
 i was a little to old for this show i was N when it first came out first off when i was a young child there were a few children 's shows that were on street which i did watch and learned from but other than that there was n't much else my were all born a few years after me N years was the first one more came latter barney was a very big part of what they watched 
 as the most offensive movie ever guaranteed to guess what it worked i 'm that we out money to rent this two friends and i were and decided to see if all that bull about the movie that we saw on tv was true comedy central and all the other networks that pushed this garbage on us it was by far the worst movie i 've seen since man i generally avoid the ones but got into this one we 
 wells ' war of the by director david michael is a slightly which is n't too bad if one considers the budget he had to work with only $ N million for this budget the production value was n't too bad the best part of it is the effects i was impressed with the considering the budget and sound design the parts of this film are the story which is very prolonged at best but again i think this is 
 this kind of is the only reason this film is anywhere above the N stars out of N line is because it 's got george behind it and it has the words star and wars in its title that is an to and many others out there who have made clearly superior films with superior story writing and acting but did not get the credit this is a things first the story 's evolution there is none apart from a 
 the movie is being televised as i simply how horrible an experience i had watching it in the whole idea of the movie is flawed the fact that europeans and americans in the desert forget all concept of and within a couple of days is the of lord of the flies was longer in the that are plenty one is the single african character that the horrible climate and have done so for ages without losing his mind and he 
 i saw last night and it was an is a film that is rich but with slow direction poor plot line and did however know this when i went in i was willing to trust the two that i went with comic that the would be out of the ordinary and so they were unfortunately of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict though this is a comment that could 
 this is a great film any fan of car racing should own a copy of this outstanding film director stephen low did a great job as well as the main stars of the film father & son mario & michael the looks & sounds amazing and best of all it 's great home theater test 
 this N movie aired six months before john goodman 's version of the life of ruth came out for my money there is no comparison between the two the tv production is n't perfect but it presents the 's story with more and than goodman 's telling i especially enjoyed the film 's of the complex relationship ruth had with yankee manager miller who always understood his star player 's and also kept trying to point out why ruth 's 
 i believe in keeping out of government and out of the movies when i want a i 'll go to church but i do n't want one from a movie i do n't mind some themes after all is about as as you can get but this movie had so much in it that i was really the reminded me of that of seen in other movies the bad guy even looked like he had and what a silly ending 
 i thought there might be some level of worth to this movie and sat through the whole thing i can by saying it left a bad taste in my movie started out ok i think the initial of was true to the both as a child and a young adult he started out pretty strong but not the but later on he somehow into a speaker by all other problem terrible the looked ok but the rest of the just 
 it 's hard to find an outright bad historical drama that 's based on the life of any number of british just take a well respected british or australian actor make things look pretty and you 're guaranteed a formula for young is no exception getting just about everything right the striking and beautiful with soft lights and colors and blunt in a role she can finally soar in the film begins with 's birthday and moves through the and

 this is not so much of a review as it is a that it has been proven yet again that the academy rewards money not artistic and i must say i am that this usually artistic and band of members have left this off the top nights is powerful raw and through script direction and acting very few movies can claim this triple crown 
 now really can u call that a movie i knew some of the movies that japanese people do are good for nothing but this bad i mean i fell a sleep three times at this movie no at all some tiny percent comedy action let 's just admit that it has some but the scenes are poorly the actors are none of the actors did a good job in it 's own role the were not convincing the script is

 to for the movie is very good it has the drama the action the and scene that will make you the story is not that original a love or make a japanese american as lord its presentation is something cool especially it uses it original language for the filipino for the japanese and english for the movie will go as one of this year 's best watch this 
 this movie will likely be too for many viewers especially contemporary audiences nevertheless i enjoyed this film thanks mostly to the of william one of my favorite stars and the beauty of jones there are some truly scenes between the pair and the talent of these two actors what in lesser hands could 've been lines the of hong kong from the period of is another highlight of this movie all in all a better than average romantic drama 
 i know that originally this film was not a box office hit but in light of recent hollywood releases most of which have been plot less of all certainly in this sorry context deserves a second opinion the film like the book loses in some of the historical background but it a american dilemma set against the american institution of human and some of its and funny and worthy of out is the robert cast as the leading figure whose 
 my mother keeps a of this film as a general threat to any film person who her everything about it such it is a true gave it were you watching a good film and voted for this one everyone involved in the movie making process should be forced to watch at least a small section of this film it should be an on the minds on all that hold film and be as the tide mark of the dire 
 first of all those who are at heart should definitely avoid this film even those like me who are to most violent and sexual acts in movies should i 'm not telling you to steer away from the film but be aware that what you 're about to see is some disturbing material definitely not a film to watch but nothing is put on screen strictly for shock value but i must admit when i watched the film for a 
 this movie like so many others remember the follows the basic formula there 's a guy he 's a does bad must play by someone else 's rules someone else 's rules change becomes good tragedy death drugs etc. tragedy effects makes him totally change must now play championship game lots of on the players and the balls wins quote from coach or news or something that explains title credits were n't you touched these movies can now be used 
 i 've got to say i 'm a big fan of these house on the left ' even the ones that most people seem to hate are often held in relatively high by me but one of these sorts of films that i did n't like much was 's train ' and unfortunately it would seem that trains and the last house on the left do n't mix as express is another something that this sort of film really needs 
 this is one of those road movies that would like to tell you a things about women the universe the better life the terrible of the brilliant architect from manhattan who all links with everyone including his three years old child may seem irresponsible to the hero wins hands down when it comes to and the scene with his old school which begins as some kind of good old days conversation and ends on a threatening note is the in 
 after seeing the it was an easy decision not to see this film i mean i do n't care for stupid i 'm sure it was also an easy choice for a lot of people to get together smoke a bowl and go check out this with the guy from the and some guy named bob should have been a good time but the film 's just not that funny too bad somebody had to go and their i found 
 in N and lewis did a tv too young to die where both played the almost the same kind of parts that they do in i have no doubt that is what led to their casting in this big screen finds writer david and his girl friend art on a rocky relationship of sorts due to 's with writing a book and getting in the minds and of serial in fact he 's got a most unusual planned he wants 
 i absolutely this film i wanted to love it i really wanted to but man oh man they were so off with and the father living was pretty that 's straight out of the temple highly recommend the book it is amazing in the book is and decent and she does the right thing because it is right she does n't have a bone in her the film she is and she does little things to get back at miss 
 overall an extremely disappointing picture very very slow build up to the basic the role of maria searching for her families secret past every take seems to last forever there is really no in the film her mother ruth is from the by a german woman played by the entire character of ruth is so one so end the film cuts back and forth between present day new york and berlin and berlin something please when you do that give 
 i was enough to have seen this at the sidewalk film festival sidewalk as a whole was a disappointment and this movie was the final in the being a fan of lewis 's ' books i was very excited about this movie 's premier which only made it that much more uncomfortable to watch normally i 'm enthusiastic about modern if they are treated well usually it 's interesting to see the parallels between the past and present within a 
 the performance was by as dillon 's girlfriend she was more interesting to me than all the lead actors this movie got it all wrong even the most actress of the century joan was not able to rise about the of the plot i did enjoy hearing man by the village people over the closing credits the rest of the movie might have been if it were to rise to that level of energy 
 i first saw this movie on an alaska airlines flight and have since seen it twice more it simply is and is simply one of the best films in years i found myself having enjoyed it after my first but a little on what had happened after seeing it again a few weeks later things began to fall into place it was n't confusing just deep in fact the of the movie may not be for a long time for 
 this movie barely followed the story line of the movie all of the points in the book did n't even exist in the movie they ended up turning it into a disney movie crush story between and it was so bad it should have been duff playing the part or one of the likes this movie was nothing more than an to the intelligence and of the book i ca n't believe disney could even get away with making such 
 i thought it was very realistic and funny dialogue and realistic action in a i did n't like how the is not really concluded or how the ending does n't give us hunter fit the part perfectly she 's one crazy actress this movie is well worth seeing 
 is a disturbing film about life art and art reflecting life the director of the film plays the role of blocked and playwright who finds in his about the subject of his girl friend 's as an arab bomber in and american through the landscape in search of his target and his nerves his girl friend 's life as she films her and himself and his actors ' lives during but the bomber has already struck and has left the 
 the hunting of fire N N and duck duck N should be considered the high water mark of the chuck collaboration while they are seldom mentioned in lists of the greatest or most important in the history of they are certainly the i 've ever seen michael never got the credit that directors like jones or avery got but it 's his dialogue and situations that make warner bros. and these three in particular some of the ever made 
 this has to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen the dialogue is the effects are the only thing that kept me watching was the and totally michael 
 what a shame this movie was never released it is now playing on cable i in based on my high regard for the stars and was by seeing a movie far better than the ones i 've been paying to see in recently i like to be surprised so often movies are marketed as but are in fact more of the same old recycled this movie is different with the bonus of a message jonathan like an even though he 
 in & out made me want to i have never seen such a film it seriously wanted to say that being is something wonderful and but has no idea how to say it to me this was not a comedy unless sick jokes are something to at when a victim falls for it from what i saw this film had four N major flaws starting with a 's character as he to the world that is former teacher howard kevin 
 i missed this movie in the but had some idea in the back of my head that it was worth a look so when i saw it on the shelves in i thought time to watch it big mistake a long list of stars can not save this turkey surely one of the worst movies ever an plot is poorly delivered and poorly presented perhaps it would have made more sense if i 'd read ' novel but unless the 
 this had all the of a very good film good actors robert parker a good plot missile from space threatens to up the planet and lots of stock if the air force had film of jets it was used unfortunately it is by too much and an impossible movie concerns a missile from space that is attacked by the soviets and diverted into a low atmospheric at under five miles and at a speed in excess of N N miles 
 this movie is a lot like the movie except with bad acting and not much the elements are there but you do n't really feel anything for the characters making the violence not very effective some parts are just strange like forcing a down what 's up with that is that supposed to be scary or it 's just kind of stupid as for there really is n't any except for the guy getting in the beginning which they do 
 this excellent drama had me in the whole time i could not take my eyes off the screen for one second because every word kept connecting the pieces to this murder this movie really touched me because it showed how sad and hard life can be i really did cry in the end which i do n't want to give away it also let me realize how and people can be when it comes to murder the cast was also 
 bill 's than rare ' movie certainly does n't follow the standard and slash guidelines that have become so essential of its counterparts the this time around uses and small arms as well as an array of weapons a that 's virtually in most pieces but there 's still just enough to keep from checking the rule book and the plot never too far from the path that you 've grown to expect just as 's surprisingly decent N was 
 this movie is horrible it rivals in the number of bad moments i would have rated it lower than a N save for a couple of funny lines but overall this film was it looked like they made it over a weekend at some bankrupt resort somewhere joe roth should join may on the sidelines forever 
 to this movie without a real plot this movie consists of N minutes of characters either drinking or making bad jokes the music is just awful the humor is n't funny and all the female characters or total it seems to me that the movie has actually been written by a N year old boy who thinks that drinking is cool women are designed to please men and all that oppose that view are also the movie has nothing to 
 reading through the comments there seems to be a lot of nonsense about the emotional of la i find this hard to given the outstanding performance by is she manages to convey perfectly the woman on the edge full of and film is and it would be so easy to the lead as a ridiculous figure consider the scene in the store for instance somehow is able to carry it off partly because of her brilliant performance but also because 
 mr. is just a bunch of it is the most tv series ever made in history the scenes are often and the horrible sends through the mr. is a and character and one can only how he is it is incredible that such a tv series of low quality can be sustained for N years it is a complete waste of time to watch even N episode and one ca n't help but to express and why had portrayed himself 
 i viewed this movie for the first time last night and i enjoyed every aspect of it the acting the dialogue the plot the script and the whole atmosphere that this movie created i would highly recommend grey gives an absolutely wonderful and first class performance in her role as baby she has a natural ability and for and she is beautiful and on the dance floor but what is wonderful about baby is that she has such a wonderful 
 the kind of movie that demands too much from the audience yet to most of them i think of the mexican people who either in an attempt to support mexican movies or willing to see a film casting top mexican stars saw it half of the people went out of the theater when i went to watch it it 's definitely not the kind of movie one could expect i think too of the people from other countries who spending 
 while i would say i enjoy the show i expected something completely different from when i first saw i like about you ' i expected to find something along the lines of that ' i am not sure if it is going on anymore but i have to say i do like the show and while i do n't it as a show it is very and i do like the chemistry between the characters as well including the supporting 
 i guess i 'm part of the silent minority who enjoyed this film is it one of the best of the nightmare series maybe not but i had lots of fun with it reaches his evil potential since parts N and N kind of lagged the series down i felt this so-called final installment new nightmare is the real brought the series out of its slump there are some great nightmare including one where plays a who gets falls and 
 having just wasted a couple of hours watching this and for N of that time in complete i can give this garbage the turkey of the year award no problem to say the plot was is some big frankly i am lost for words to describe this not only are the characters completely and utterly without any of this sort of stuff has been done much better in dozens of killer ' but the acting was dire for those who 
 a new and innovative show with a great cast that keeps you on the edge of your seat lake bell is wonderful it is to bad that her other show miss match was canceled i am just glad she came back on surface i ca n't wait for the return of surface this show is really something unique to watch with an world that is to park this show keeps you wondering what is next is even if he is

 this is an amazing film to watch or show young people aside from a very brief scene it gives an interesting into colonial rule in africa that you 'll rarely find in other films it does bear a similarity to out of africa but without all the romantic the white french people in are because they do n't even seem to regard the as people the whites are all the bosses and they expect black without question however unlike real 
 being light the big blue has directed and interpreted this strange movie which is the second installment of some kind of i might be wrong but i do n't think this movie 's part of the though it really looks like it i 'm not really sure of what i think about this film all actors are good they deliver pretty good performances especially and the story is somehow interesting but i do n't know there 's something about the

 there was no in this movie and really shows how much this who directed this needs to learn his craft all his characters in this movie were so and i could care less the best point in this movie was the end credits and the hour long after this cause i felt so damn that i wasted money on this load and are from two different places learn something about asian culture the dog scene in this felt so tacked 
 i liked this movie a lot but the feeling that i most came away with was the memory of how much enjoyed the novel the film features two of the best working today who is great here and the who does the best she can with the character she is given as well as a surprisingly excellent pfeiffer and a steady the is basically to the book at least as as it can be in an hour and minutes the 
 von once explained how he created such strong involvement from the with his movies by placing his movie world in about the middle of the real world and the world so as viewers we think we watch a true story while in fact we are often to the point that the movie works disturbing in the dark or painful the of course the acted only as a vehicle for this theory besides creating some welcome on von story is typical

 there are a select few films where animals or something not human is portraying human beings and i think that this film is one of them apart from a few points of the plot and the characters this film could be changed with all people rather than mainly animals although it 's good someone did not i feel the are good in this film portraying humans this film also focuses on quite a lot of adult issues which is rather

 this modern film with its off beat and dizzying succession of plot a story full of surprises dangerous characters and excellent entertainment from start to finish it 's impossible not to with the honest hero or to be by the ways in which he tries to his way out of the terrible that he finds himself in so all you can do is your seat belt and enjoy the story of an ordinary guy who makes a poor decision and 
 now maybe it had something to do with the fact that i saw this movie at a low point in my life when i was really trying to figure out where i was going and what i needed to make myself happy but this film really spoke to me is an although she has so many positive things going for her she is still vulnerable and unhappy in her life she is strong and but she was out of her 
 as a rule a full moon production is a warning sign to avoid a film but because i 've enjoyed jeffrey in other films i gave it a 's not bad not great but that 's something else the film involves a struggle with a evil brother who wants to dominate the and the title character dr. also has to deal with people and authorities in the mundane world which he does can travel between and does so to find

 i 'm the sort of person who went down to the local library and read books on 's difference engine my were playing football etc so if there is any such thing as a target audience for this film then i guess i 'd probably be included in i just need to watch it again a previous mentioned not to watch this film being tired maybe that was my tried my best to enjoy this film and there are aspects 
 you would think that a film that three of the biggest male film stars of the post world war ii era would have become a classic these three who also happen to be three of mine walk around in a looking like they 'd rather be any place but sad thing is that the way west definitely had some potential to be a classic in these days of political a film about american and the of their is something not

 my favorite movie is the western it 's really the only movie that is of american and despite no one does them quite like at the top of my list of ten is it was the first and only black and white film of the partnership of director anthony and actor james stewart it was also a landmark film in which stewart opted for a percentage of the profits instead of a straight salary from universal many such deals followed

 i have not read the other comments on the film but judging from the average rating i can see that they are unlikely to be very watched it for the second time with my children they absolutely loved it true it did not have the adults rolling around the floor but the sound of the children 's made it seem is a true brooks with plenty of moral content how sad it is to be loved for our money not

 this movie answers the question how does a relationship survive when your girlfriend is and has powers and far beyond those of women without the movie i can assure you it does not but there 's great fun to be had along the way is perfect as the an named who unlike most in her is not always dedicated to truth justice and the american way is also as the yet somehow still when she is dumped for a less

 this is only the second time i have been moved enough to write a review unfortunately both times they have been for movies that can be described with several N words that can be defined as or the other movie of such was and onto the review there are several key things wrong with this movie which i will describe steven has lost the plot in all his other movies family friend gets killed steven gets angry steven people the 
 the very first image of the movie shows a mountain in early morning autumn and my thought was this is almost too beautiful and it goes on like this images of landscape and animals that look like a series of romantic paintings each of them perfect in every detail even the girl 's room her father 's car everything is romantic beautiful this could seem and but it fits a story that is itself of silent beauty happening on the

 i saw this movie as a child and fell in love with it it has a sweet sensitive story something children can appreciate i loved so much as a child i had to find it for my daughter it is definitely a movie i would watch with kids it me a great deal of story 's of a disney nature like pete 's and mary both because of the live action and features but on its it is also a 
 the fact that someone actually spent money on such a bad script is beyond me this really must be one of the worst films in addition to highway i have ever seen bad actors and a really bad story there 's no normal reactions to any event in this film and even though it 's halloween normal people would have bigger reactions when they 're their father being killed not to mention people with tape covering their airways not being 
 contrary to popular belief this title to me at least is not so very bad in fact i regard it as a film of all time the of stories was n't structured too well when you consider the differences between the series however despite all this you can watch it quite for a feature film of its day the scenes are well and the characters remain consistently track is a personal of mine nearly everything has a correct sound effect 
 i really think this movie is very basic a different kind of colombian movie is and the actors uses local that are so much fund to shows a different face and i think that 's very important because colombia is a diverse country and we need to show that to the world this is the first movie of the director and i really except this movie will be the beginning of a great career as a film need to continue 
 from the which brought you the N comes its even more read right off the bat we get another beginning of time which even to completely these same events as set up in the first film a of from same is soon followed by a credits here we have four who steal ' seven but poorly a crime which for one thing sets the moon on a course with planet earth faster than you can say once again played as 
 everything that made the original so much fun seems to here this is simply a run of the mill on the loose havoc but without the passion that the 's nothing new in the story in fact it seems like they ignore the first one altogether here the run loose in a high security apartment building and naturally kill most of the residents in fashion the makeup effects actually seem less convincing here than the first time around although the 
 here we 've got an of typical and not that the script has not its big and a few are a bit but the is a optical treat and the is first rate the of fast and slow sometimes nearly parts has no comparison in its kind of movie so a is rather hard the is a disaster or with deeper human and political notes than usual well worth to be seen worldwide in but i am hoping this for

 upon seeing this film once again it appeared superior to me this time than the previous times i have viewed it the acting is wonderful the characters are very clearly drawn is simply as the son who rebels the other actors and are equally fine in every respect robert redford creates a wonderful period piece from the days of of the the is beautiful of the and of western all in all this is one of the films made in 
 oh yes i admit i have made myself guilty of the crime of seeing this piece of trash i ca n't say i was forced by aliens who pointed a gun at my head tied me to a chair and made it impossible for me to close my eyes and then turned this awful excuse for a movie on no i did it with free will i deliberately myself let 's go through the fact here folks the acting is 
 i had high expectations going into this film but i feel let down i bought it for N at a used place and the version i bought was the english dubbed version the is awful so just was n't as good in this film as in run run and the bad guy just came out of nowhere and starts to catch on to what 's going on the second she gets to the university seems to me i was also 
 this movie just might make you the film was well worth the dark trip to town is the lone acceptable soap out there her character is so and so convincing that you find yourself in over her being such a i might even allow myself to get lost in ' fantasy if it were n't for the fact that dr. 's real name is george and speak of the his role very well while charlie morgan freeman makes you wish 
 to be completely honest i have n't seen that many western films but i 've seen enough to know what a good one by far the worst western on the planet off there black people in the wild west come on who ever thought that this could be a cool off the wall movie that everyone would love were slightly no no completely in that day and age women especially black women were not prone to be carrying and or 
 this movie is so bad and part N to N are so great nothing is good a lot of but without meaning and the majority of time without the movie is about the past the present N and the future of the box the of the box and his fight against some but nothing link up seriously the N stories is in the movie but it is n't he is just a boring bad guy who kids and kill and 
 i agree that this film was spectacular the way in which jamie captured not only the impression of ray charles but the of ray charles really made the film his life made a great story and it is good that it is finally being told i also found a great interview with jamie about this role by from on houston channel the link is & & i encourage everyone to check it out as it gives in looks into what 
 unfortunately i think this is one of those films that if you or i took it to the studio and said i make this great movie with my friends mary and from school ' the studio would have you kicked to death on the spot however if a bunch of massive hollywood names say i fancy a to italy with my how about it ' the studio writes a kick off with the casino boss from ocean 's N tracking

 yes it 's pure trash it might be interesting for every guy who likes experimental like me to see and doing nothing for almost two hours but it gets very painful when you realize you have actually paid for this probably this is one of those films you love to watch for its complete and i accept it though for its shock value decades before and pulp

 included this film surely is the best production i 've seen so far even though i still have quite a few to check out the house that blood is a an that contains four stories involving the tenants of a vicious house in the british a common mistake in productions like this is too much energy on the story that the separate peter 's film does n't pay too much attention to that it simply handles about a scotland yard

 a funny thing happened to me while watching on the one hand the hero is a and the director is totally unable to make us understand why he does what he does excuse me through his images on the other hand the english version at least is very badly dubbed so i found myself there had been both more and less dialogue at the same time this film is stupid funny how this guy has access to every and in

 on its surface this is one of the most entertaining films i 've seen in a long time me of old movies that had just the right balance of unexpected humor and integrated action beyond this though there is our knowledge of this film 's context it has the same elements of but is set just before many of the characters would truly understand the of what was happening to their country and the world and the consequences of some

 warning this movie is it is not entertainment i have n't the words to describe the that i felt at the is a badly made movie about the of society during the whole movie i kept waiting for it to get better it did n't instead it just kept getting worse and i see a movie that is as bad as this one i always try to find at least one good thing to say about it in this case

 i gave this movie a rating for a few reasons first i felt that this movie was definitely and i hate that still it 's my own fault for watching a christian movie in the first friend and i this movie because it sounded interesting the back of the case said something along the lines of a battle someone opening some sort of that let into our world and the like something i am very interested in indeed this movie 
 shots shots scenes are what you will find in this film in other words it seemed technically poor to me the musical are directed no in the would-be badly bad and obvious of the actors from time to time etc the film is long and boring eventually it makes few point and even less sense there are some good ideas though some of the comic elements are actually efficient especially the opening scene however the film gets worse and worse

 i did n't really know what to expect from but i certainly hoped it would be a little better than what i got i knew the rating was bad and the reviews were unfavorable but the illustration looks beyond cool and i ca n't resist that for a very long too long in fact time this film raised the impression of being an to 's with and offensive five one of them an exact young of jim desperately want to

 ok i got the set last week and i am finally getting around to posting my reviews but i sure liked this in many N rage of the this one movies at a fast has some really good effects and some really well done atmosphere and style i would actually go on record as saying this may be one of the most shot that i have bought most of the time i get rather angry at movies for being boring 
 it like me of the best of those N 's movies directed by john hughes everything takes place in a world where everyone is attractive there are some conflicts that occasionally take away from the mostly happy proceedings and vast amounts of plot are by set to pop nothing wrong with this however it like is an treat from beginning to end my wife and i found ourselves totally won over by the even as we were making fun of 
 mere fact that i start off my review with ' says it all i used to watch this movie all the time as a kid and even then i the of it all the low budget horrible acting and script was ever apparent back then i watched it again yesterday and just could n't stop laughing it 's so bad it 's actually good like another said it does n't take itself seriously there 's no way one could look

 this movie 's basic is that everyone in the world can know that a person is except for that person and that a man who likes show has good taste and is neat in appearance must be a homosexual yes the movie is funny in parts but the basic is to and that the entire movie into something that is quite painful to sit through the performances particularly joan and kevin are very good

 this is quite an amazing film to watch using digital technology the director has literally his living actors into painted most of the time this works especially at the start where the film is like a pop up story book come to life it is less successful in a few scenes where it limits camera they had not painted the side of some of the buildings for example but it is a very interesting way to film a historical film 
 if there were an epa for film then this movie would get their most approval if we all recycled our stuff to this degree we 'd never run out of how i was reminded of this movie when i first saw i the at least did n't his old is a but it 's a nice in spots i liked when the kid said damn rocks and if you like explosions even recycled ones you will get your for an

 should be for attempting to convert one of the great works of english into a movie and then silly for this attempt the was poor the characters looked ridiculous the music was and the film was a through the first book and a half of 's i can still remember my sheer disappointment and for the movie when i first saw it now i realize that any attempt to convert a book into a movie is bound to fail in 
 bound is a beautiful film the part where shadow falls down the i considering i was only six i it takes a lot to make me cry the dogs and the cat are trained a nice family movie not for completely people or but could for people like good film overall 
 simply i found the tv show oh ever so politically correct and biggest of all and that is that it is was you have alan as the main lead star who is so in love with himself and his that it actually made me uncomfortable to even try and sit through an episode the original series had both and wayne rogers whom i 'll admit had a certain and style to their character presentation however harry henry morgan and mike 
 imagine that you could have anything you wanted go anywhere you be anything you 'd ever of being through thought alone now imagine yourself sharing this gift with the love of your life what would you do would such powers be worth your soul this is the dilemma presented to christopher in the the pilot episode of the original star series deemed too and too cold by nbc and rejected the was nevertheless the most ambitious and costly pilot ever

 what can i say that has n't already been said about this great show nothing this is without a doubt one of the most shows i 've ever encountered or the newer stuff is way too down for my and some of the mature stuff i have to kids out of the room for but not stories are engaging and very some of them could even be stretched out to an hour or two for a movie episodes like weather 
 this movie is banned in just about every foreign country i can think of the japanese people who star in this must have been really desperate for a job or we 're just friends here 's the three the hell out of a woman they use all kinds of things to eventually kill her they her kick her spin here around in a chair over N times they use sound by forcing her to listen to a sound for over 
 i this movie knowing that it would be bad i have only seen one good disney and that was toy story N but it went far lower than my expectations i am a die hard disney fan and i just do n't believe in with disney movies for somebody who did n't grow up with the either watching them when they came out or them since you were born it 's a story i just feel that the plot was 
 this is hardly a movie at all but rather a real show for the most part in and some of the greatest stage stars of the day in the is an absolutely amazing production number that must be seen be sure to wear your cap

 a not so good action because it unsuccessfully trends the same water as early steven films because there is not a very good set piece steven plays the same kind of character that he has played since above the law in my opinion the performance of ivory is wasted in such an average film and belongs in a much better film bob is as the main heavy the best acting in the entire film belongs to brian cox who is 
 contain who ever made this film must have had a lot of connections i just ca n't see it any other way what really surprises me is no one used the name allen and more surprising everyone involved did n't use this where to begin the bad dialogue the the sorry looking film stock the comedy the characters and more than george w. bush 's college career i do n't know what was the guy losing his arm because of

 you know i 'm getting really tired of all the generic music being used in these type of movies see disturbing behavior etc every scene of genuine tension here and there is some is immediately undercut with some pop tune completely the why do they do that to sell some of course but in this case mission did anyone buy the cd and ms. attacks her role with and with some to add kick but what are leslie and doing

 this was very and and at the same time entertaining which i thought was rather impressive i felt as if they did a very good job covering the sport from its ' until present day but nonetheless there is a reason why i do not give such a high score to this film i felt as if at times the story focused too much on the ' of the sport so to speak too much on individual locations at which 
 this little film had long been on my list do people realize how stressed out abused women as well as the were really treated by the medical profession at the turn of the century all of the christian attitudes of that time were deadly to exploring true emotional feelings that would allow us to suffering let alone explore what it means to our can you really imagine by today 's standards that walt 's books were banned because he acknowledged

 i saw this film from N recently at our local film it seems that the film institute has it in N to the anniversary of which was one of the largest in the world in the early century i believe there are several copies with english circulating around europe at the moment i found the film and the trip to well thought out the plot line is certainly original but i really do n't want to reveal any more of 
 i always think it would be nice if you could somehow have a ' at some of the old movies that are on before you purchase them that way you could save yourself some time money and a certain degree of when you feel so utterly let down the buddy story is such a do not wish to go into the or the in the plot or the around with historical facts that this movie for i had already come 
 well of course the critics it this is n't a movie that 's going for the big-time critical but the fact is that it 's really very if you do n't like that chris brand of physical comedy or the dry of david you 're not going to like it but for the rest of us the movie has many and for that matter and the plot is n't half as as that of black sheep the parts that are 
 this movie about a sister and her battle to save as many as she can is very moving the film does well in picking up the characters and showing how sister deals with wonderful from life to death 
 this very good movie with tension the stakes are of course high will the police and the public health doctor the criminals who do n't know that they are carrying before a breaks out but smaller plot elements introduce tension in every scene between and the police between the bad guys played by and between and a dying man whom mistakenly believes is the subject of a because he has in some valuable commodity between and his wife and with 
 i doubt whoever wrote this has ever actually read park or if they have it was not very well none of the characters are what they should be is and of her while sir thomas who treated her very well seems to have fallen into ' additionally a first person by is highly inappropriate to both the story and her character is not an entertaining and i would contend that she is not meant to be additionally in the movie 
 i guess i 'm pretty much a fan of and destroyed stephen king stories when they reach the ' as any of us sad out here i know full well that most of them are done poorly i expect it i plan on it i allow for it but this time so i think i saw this thing a number of years ago fine i thought i remembered that it was pretty good wrong like i 'm saying granted in 
 this is an classic monster from the N 's i just love the look of the N 's in general like the cars and the music anyway i love the way the looks i love when the everyone is at the late night at the theater and the comes in and crashes the party another thing i love about it is that it takes place all in one night just like halloween steve and are making out they see a

 i saw this film over the weekend and while i was impressed as always with the beauty and polish of films i left disappointed that this one fell so short failing to inform members and leaving investigators with many film is N minutes of from the life of joseph smith it 's not a true because there 's no real most of the episodes concern joseph doing good playing baseball running races and laughing with children often in motion what 
 william in small is unfortunately instead of leaving his character as a minor and in that moderately amusing it has been seen fit to his role and it just as occurred in the original star series i guess i will never understand american which frequently goes the top ' to get the message through i vote with my feet i no longer watch the show which is a shame because the rest of the cast were good it is that 
 ' ' or should really be called ' ' for every festival has a disappointment and this is the one that fails to live up to its fighting rather this is the tale of a khmer country girl who 's has taught her a little along with a few odd but specific rules do n't walk under a do n't eat raw meat and do n't accept money for your powers well guess what folks the girl moves to to 
 very slow movie with a confusing story line the movie 's only hope of keeping the audience interested is the thrown in at regular is and her looks do not hold up when she is on screen with the wilson not sure what this movie was about 
 unfortunately a boring and obviously the only way to see it is the public version which is so and dark that at times you have hard time making out where the screen is the leading actors are a the man spends most of his screen time trying to appear and totally what the film is about and that he is a murder suspect because of some who played him for a to start with the herself merely walks through the 
 it 's wonderful to see that is already international influence shares many themes with a room for the vague class identity above working but well below middle the father the abandoned urban the sense of adult failure the barely modern urban life but if is an expert trades in images and his composed serve to distance the and rather bleak subject matter which from high to tragedy within seconds there are and but is mad an ordinary man with ordinary 
 maybe i expected too much of this film but at the very least a comedy should be funny and this one has very few amusing moments it manages to be to women the and probably several other groups as well the scene at where claims to be is one of the most i have ever and dillon are and kevin seems most of the compare the film to will and grace but at least will and grace funny 
 i own this movie not by choice i do i was really the other day and the box me so i it in the old and spent the next hour and a half of my life why god why the was not that bad as an i could appreciate of it i think that maybe if you 're into romantic scenes you 'll enjoy this film i always thought of myself as a you know like unable to love there 
 the first part of with john and john is one of the best movie for this one is a very bad copy the change is only in the sex in the first one the good one was here it 's michael i prefer to watch the first 
 first off this really is my favorite film ever i do n't need to give anyone a because every a hole does that i am literally with this practically effects having ' showing ' badly N 's metal the director i heard had hoped for a hit at the box office so that he could do and have a type of deal for himself damn i wish that could 've went down like that the 's ' the acting 's 
 i must say i was really excited about this film before it as it was an happy madison production and i am usually attracted to that type of silly were a few funny moments at the beginning of the film but this film lacked everything that makes a good movie i realize that many are not realistic can still be quite funny but this film was and not funny at all the acting was horrible the was very poor the 
 what a for i could n't stand the constant and all the time it did n't make me scared or make me sympathetic the characters it was simply the camera movements were also the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap there was a few attempts to give the characters some but it did n't really work into the rest of the plot and then there 's the ending i 'm still not really sure what to 
 there have been plenty of unknown movies or movies given bad reviews that i really liked this was not one of was and used camera techniques that made me feel like i was watching a soap opera it was predictable and took most of the movie to get going then left you asking that 's it once i decided not to take the movie too seriously and watch it from a point of view it became more this is one 
 the film directed by was not a film to be honest i had ever really heard of until the film forum in said that they would have a of the film with new english when i also read that it was in the of the classic french crime films jean pierre i jumped at the chance to check it out at best it would rank up with his great works and at worst i would get some good in a 
 a lot of death happens in the wild you do n't need to be a rocket scientist to figure that out but does it need to be the focus of a nature what is with this with death do we really have to see an adult elephant torn to by a pack of or a a by the in slow motion no less i thought this was going to be a nature film and why not have the to show 
 this movie is more then most especially coming from other then the bad it is n't first hour is a lot like the comic which is what all the stuff is based on 's trying to get a huge 's using 's weakness to women to try to get something out of it the last bit is n't that bad he 's with another women but of course 's still him number lot of the other movies are more family 
 ok so by minute N in the film there 's still no film arrived to me in a from down under with on the front i am a from a north american and love was sent to me by our chief as a potential having 'd at the vary away i thought this film is not for us no dialogue by minute N but kept watching anyway well well well it built and built and built and half way in 
 i just watched return to streets of and dead man 's walk all excellent this sorry of junk is done and poorly the previous series call and come off as tough respectable cowboys despite the fact that call is played by a different actor every time each one quickly won me over in dead man 's walk the boys are as the younger versions of the experienced texas in moon they are just a couple of i had to stop 
 my score for this N N N for the technical only everything else is very bad another film that makes no sense clearly it seems that creating a good script for film or television is almost a impossible mission while it 's easy to understand why politicians never say the truth they are among the biggest on the planet it is difficult to understand how to make films so we must believe that taking people for perhaps it was reason 
 although not one of 's better known works it is a thought out i especially like how the director the couple in love

 this is the best and most original show seen in years the more i watch it the more i fall in love with it the cast is excellent the writing is great i personally like every character however there is a favorite character for everyone as there is a good mix of and backgrounds just like in real life i believe abc has done a to the writers actors and to the potential audience of this show to cancel so 
 a good script or director could n't original ' was a story of human against odds and personal tragedy the were led by a figure of great strength who would take anything god threw at tries to the mix but fails through a script and direction allen may have been a great producer of disaster and done a fine job the action scenes in ' but he just ca n't bring any human to his characters if the characters are

 very disappointing chapter of this slowly dying series very evident that the budget was extremely low this movie was made for one reason and one reason alone to sell master toys fans such as myself of the series have decided from what i have read and heard that the only one in the series worse than this is of the in turn turning us away from the series to make this a film for whatever reason did not work in 
 the beauty of this film is in the great portrayal of the power of a mother 's love the performances the steady execution and the quite innovative script the film tells the story of an indian woman who lives in canada with her husband and little kid all of a sudden her husband her that his family in india of whom she had not even known is in troubles and the couple rush to india when they get into the

 i was a when this first appeared in theaters and i saw it in japan the film 's plot was n't my cup of tea as a high school but i went to see it for the process it had been in the press so that even service personnel overseas had heard of it though it never at the post film started the trend of throwing at the audience which was taken to absurd levels with later do n't know 
 true fans of film will love this disagree with the who are rating this movie a and calling it while i do n't have the background or come from the environment of the i 've spent many years working in lower income and working class neighborhoods and feel the acting was very real and representative of how i do n't know what the basis is for others ' comments that the film is the is low budget production value did 
 probably the best film of the year for me this small french film centers on put upon office secretary carla who spends her days doing other men 's jobs and being the source of their and conversation which is all too clear to her as being partially she reads a change is set in motion when she newly con paul vincent as her assistant the relationship which develops between them is the of the film mutual for different reasons bonds 
 true memories i lived in at the time and looked forward to it every sunday evening and later i saw it during my very good for my at the time english as dutch tv provides for other except for shows so you would hear the original voices and language the best series were the first three ones and then after the third series the great character von who was such a enemy disappeared from the series i do n't think

 this movie is one of the most bad action films ever put to film ' with a japanese is funny enough but add really action to the mix an and a love interest and one of the worst of all time and you 've got yourself quite the little cure for people who enjoy their life and up till watching had never contemplated killing themselves with a do n't know if it 's just me but the whole homosexual is

 but i got over it to me it seemed that even the author of the book favored i felt so sorry for the character and she was constantly compared with who was evil i just felt the comparison was a bit harsh and really though the movie was bad i would n't really see it unless you 're ready for a big let down 
 i do n't understand where these bad comments are coming from the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the part that gets you is that this could all happen not to the extent perceived in the movie but the whole idea is reality this movie took that reality and it into a up the third one is from the dead body in my 
 i think this show was right on the money for me i watched it over the plane but there were parts in the movie that made me control myself from all over the place the chemistry between richard and lane was very acting on both parts i loved how lane 's daughter acted in the show too she displayed maturity and how she transformed throughout the show was easy to believe as what a could possibly be like in real

 that 's right you heard me this movie is a ' first off the band who the hell is going to go see or listen to a band called the naked brothers band not only is the name terrible but so are the musicians they ca n't even play anything also the lead singer sounds more than lee and even more his voice is horrible not only are they terrible musicians but they 're terrible actors led by a director

 i finally managed to see this movie after so many years of i was so to see if this movie it is as bad as some people say and my opinion is that this movie it was n't bad at all on the contrary it was amazing i enjoyed every second from it from the beginning until the end the actors were great they sent me the feeling that i was living the story at the same time as the

 i can not believe that this is a film that i did not like i usually find that i am open about all sorts of stuff but this is just well could deal with the subject matter if the script and story were better i could deal with the acting if the camera work was better or if the characters were better established i think it mostly down to script and direction was just want to give this the lowest 
 i saw this film without to know what about were i 'm a fan of even more his shakespeare ' films and in the beginning i saw it only for this and i finished with in my eyes because the great great values affect and philosophy about life of 's girl recommended to people who are with tv programming in spain at least

 i was this by the director of a film i am working with in which i play an actor who is playing knowing his own style i did not expect anything a classical interpretation of the i have found is sometimes striking sometimes but often and like most experimental music i find that in films such as this the building blocks of powerful are even if they have not found their most useful form in a more we have a

 in the same way was a of his father mario who was an extremely director anyway is a director in the the church has at least one thing to recommend it the detailed art direction but absolutely nothing else the film is filled with characters and almost put me to sleep several times there 's a fine line between ' and ' and while the church is n't completely you 'd be better off watching something 
 i 've seen this movie on several different occasions i find one of the things to do is to just watch the reactions of the different types of people who go to see N old people a lot of old japanese men and women go to this movie because they think it will be a movie with lots of and japanese dialogue as soon the two begin movies while almost throughout their sentences the old people walk out usually N

 henry thomas was great his character held my attention i was so into the story that i it was n't real i wanted him to keep the baby and see what a special person he was the other people in the story were essential in the makeup of his character the way they together to help one another was truly i love movies that show the real side of human without having to hit you over the head in that 
 i understand the purpose of the director to tell stories that are n't stories but the way he tried to show time passing by the couple of who first appear together than with a than the man alone and to link the of the characters the final scene with the climbing a mountain seeing the big black guy on another and then seeing the boat with her former employer and saying oh a boat were awful at the same time 
 i just watch this move recently on channel what a great film a great cast as well is very and the movie has a great opening scene by the ocean then to a series of scene establishing the questions about life after death which provide a very strong story involvement therefore nelson played by was the first to go through the test to die and come back to life then it 's gets very dramatic by bringing back his wrong 
 this film is pure i knew nothing of it before i entered the dark room took my seat i was by the and on the i also is nice and and richard is always a guy to have around so the cast seemed reasonable it may have been his name above the title that convinced me to go with this instead of whatever else was on i should 've gone to see for the second time thin plot around 's

 two soldiers is an excellent example of fine the director and producer took a story and brought it to life with a very skilled and dedicated cast excellent and very creative of the brothers was with great details and sharply with the that they were thrust into the between the brothers brought and as they struggled with a hard but peaceful life in the of north carolina and an even harder life of acting was great particularly from the younger

 a lot of people are this film for the presence of paris hilton but this is not a fair reason to object to the movie the reality is that paris has a fairly minimal part she spends the vast majority of the movie off screen the film also makes fun of her on several occasions usually involving a camera and at least once in night vision for those who enjoy paris stage presence this may be a movie to see

 loved the movie loved the two families crossing in history only question is if sam gets killed then how does his family 's line continue he is 's son and zero is supposed to be related but no mention of any other children never mentioned any other children or wife prior to his speaking with and falling in love with the teacher maybe she had a child prior to becoming the kate even with the mistakes in the movie just

 all the many problems that make this a dire piece of is the plot device in recent history richard who the 's real target is through some form of he does not work anything out it just comes to him when in doubt he 's going after the first lady this film chunks 
 only adding to the chorus of people who deemed this to be ' i will state the following without the obvious flaws stated by some of the other the film is shot on video what type of camera i do n't know but the had it on all the time so that any slight movement makes it go in and out of focus in many of the scenes the actors themselves go out of focus for their scenes this alone 
 steven directed and with james the star this strange little drama with very good ideas and intentions make a film that takes a different than the usual fare and make a drama that wants to be on its merits as a so why does n't it work for the film loses direction from the opening frame and rather throughout the film dead set on making a but getting into satisfying an audience who wants to see not that that is 
 richard and lane star in a with the sort of ending i get really angry about lets just say its not my cup of tea just like the store are not my cup of plot has a doctor at an and meeting a woman that he has a deep but brief affair with he goes off to meet his son and she goes back to her acted and well made the to get a real plot line this is the 
 i like but as a fan i hate this one mild boys who have enough energy to and dance in the the poor of london coming out to and walking off into the not exactly to the novel as i recall was publicly and went crazy in prison end of oliver reed is very weak as doing little more than to indicate his evil worst however is mark as oliver who often comes across so and passive you wonder if 
 is not as bad as many have made it out to be i found the film to have some of the like that in paul 's the lack of dialogue and over the top action is and adds to the particular stands out for me has the names of several campaigns 'd onto his and one of these is gate for the ones out there gate is mentioned in roy 's last lines in to imagine that could have fought 
 this was the worst films i have ever encountered the was with long shots like a camera on a a stage play with dramatic that made little sense to the content on screen the was terrible scenes matched together with the of a butcher the plot on the being familiar with the historical night in which mary wrote the acting was forced with the type of character development that left you with an intense interest in seeing each of them 
 this is only the second time i stopped a part way was willing to give this film the benefit of the doubt at first even though it managed to be both and stupid and and was like an after school special directed by that weird grade nine kid who thinks nobody understands him and sad with that only the most would consider and some and no really the poor child 's suffering enough already especially when it into a and 
 this is an extremely long movie which means you may become very before it becomes interesting but its length provides opportunity for its characters to find permanent in your you are moved by the of the you will find it particularly because it is a story that finds its heroes among the evil and the weak if you can love a monster you 'll cry for the spy who everyone notably his country his friends and family a man who 
 the get you to the movie but the movie just was n't worth my it has some good effects but the i like lee jones and will smith as actors they have both done some good films but i wish they had n't added this one to their resume 's to be honest the book is better 
 possible this movie 's reputation it so it was with anticipation that i sat down to watch it in on what a major cast is and the production values are but the characters are without the plot is thin and the whole thing goes on too long for a movie that deals with family divisions gambling and sexual repression the movie is flat and one example is the portrayal of frank 's his rather request to his wife to go 
 the sound is terrible the picture is worse than worse the acting is awful the female leading actress is and the story is wait a minute there is no story the plot is really bad and the title of the movie is misleading if you expect to to see you might be disappointed this movie has nothing to do with the movies from N and actually i can only think of one scene involving only thing that i liked about 
 i 'm a huge michael jackson fan i grew up with his music was actually the first music video i ever saw apparently believe it or not there was a time where michael jackson was like a god to people a time where women at the sight of him before really before seeing the sight of him sorry michael but was what started to be a to all of michael 's success of the time right when he released his 
 i i should be fair and point out that i do n't believe in ghosts that said i 'm very interested in the subject and i enjoy a scary story as much as the next guy i am a fan of ghost because they at least try to give their investigations a scientific even early episodes of most had a camp entertainment factor to them state has neither of these the cases themselves have the potential to be interesting but 
 although there were a few rough spots and some plot lines that were n't exactly true to character this was classic lots the characters outside of mike were true to form and the scenes of and were as deep and well acted as anything ever to grace the small screen the movie life is a fan but stands on its own as well as any episode of the series and did a wonderful job in pulling loose ends from N 
 grand champion is a bit old fashion at first andrew at the fort worth star said it best if walt disney had hailed from texas he would have made grand champion the movie does not have the video and special effects but it has heart and soul the kids are great and the array of stars is incredible i bet bruce and roberts are proud to be in a movie that their kids can actually see rated this is a 
 you ca n't watch a film like peter ' privilege a story of the of a pop music performer by big business the state and even organized without thinking of commodities like michael jackson or who corporate giants like pepsi or some other poison for money or any number of in music or movies who become tools of political parties or commercial interests like and a film like privilege must have seemed almost like science when released in N so

 i just finished reading 's novel ' i thought it was one of the most in detailed and books i ever read definitely in my top i acquired a version of the book mr. ok let me first point out that to fit a decent of the novel into hours film time would of been impossible so i understand the teams reason to from the book version and differ however when i say differ what i really should say is 
 this movie really really story a and young men and women into it goes like this people they find him he becomes a changed man and is released on the world yet again back to his old ways and starts the again the story is stupid it 's the characters are stupid they 're or at the very least way over the top it 's got some very violent and if you have a week you might just want to 
 this is just i regret every second of the N minutes i spent watching this i think it 's supposed to be a comedy but i do n't remember laughing much except at a few and downright man called meets up with rich women via hearts ads and then them for the money he needs to feed his gambling that 's the whole plot and that 's really all that happens along the way there is an attempt at when 
 i watched the other night and am to put together a public service is another version of the the channel has a growing catalog of and movies and the promised an but this one refused to let me switch channels it was bad i watched in and at the train you could n't your eyes away from i reached for a and managed to capture part of what i was seeing the following may contain or might just save your 
 N was fun from start to 's difficult to define why one film or with you or not and i wo n't try to analyze such perfect comedy so politically incorrect that even academic papers should be dedicated to it everything is old here from women 's clothes sigh dance the hero sounds like an italian sung in is imposing but as hell from all the he looks like but is definitely more because he 's silly speaks his mind 
 i absolutely this movie as a child and still do as an adult to say that is even an my sister brother and i watched it one year at our ' house during christmas vacation they had taped it from tv our parents were glad it kept us occupied for the one night but they thought we would tire of it and be ready for activities the next day not so we became they could not have us if they 
 ok so it 's a silly movie but i think they knew that when they made it and there are some neat little on the otherwise tired borrowed a tape just because i knew someone in it but i did loan it out to a couple who also liked it 
 the end of as it should appeal to general citizens & mass consumers alike is likely to become of cultural reform status the film uses analysis by authors policy makers and social on the created by living mainly in the we have created in america is a place with none of the of country life and none of the of urban city life this is the prescription that is laid out for and the film focus 's on the idea 
 this show was rushed and relied heavily on surprise cuts to commercials when it came back from commercial the noise or surprise was something simple like a mouse this is a pure of ghost and it attempts to go beyond them and fails also what is with the directors thing is this star it just the of this show which wore off quick the only reason it 's been watched is that people want to at the pure nature of 
 disney might just be on to something here first they had remember the with a story based on truth involving sports and a small town in middle america now with and the yet another sports story based on movies move you to at times and both make you and feel all warm after seeing them my wife and i took in the and we expected it to be a great feel good type movie we were not let down when 
 this is a very very odd film one that is so odd it 's best you just see it for yourself the film begins with a professor his class because the students have the to not be as brilliant as he is you can tell very quickly that this man is a total finding the value in practically nothing but sticking to his own inner sense of additionally he seems tired and with the of in the film he walks 
 silly and short gun crazy volume N a woman from nowhere goes brief just over minutes tale is n't so much inspired by the classic as it is a of sam 's the quick & the dead his admitted to the brought into a contemporary setting in quick & dead sharon stone 's character seeks against the played by gene who when she was but an placed the fate of her father a brief by gary in her hands she

 this film was my first with the of chris i was deeply impressed with the character he played i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this actor he plays a union who along with a couple of men are in eastern kentucky they happen upon the farm of a woman whose husband has chosen to go off to the the portrayal of eastern kentucky and its seriously divided during the war is 
 one of best movies ever fire it is not much about of india today it is the mind use of light that never stops never becomes normal even when in this sense the movie is almost unique both leads are of very good quality the of as a street performer are pretty obvious her performance is a but the use of the light i have look at it and looked at it again and again still mind after ages nothing 
 wonderful movie adult content lots of scenes plus excellent music and dance scenes my wife and i absolutely loved this movie and wish they 'd make more like it 
 director jay craven 's of howard frank 's the flow north ' is one of the from literature to the screen craven is an of 's work he also directed ' a in the cast is especially torn and torn offers what could be the role of his career lord the fiercely independent former who is at the center of this story 's portrayal of lord 's wife is as well i 'm both and disappointed that neither of them 
 if you a do n't waste your time otherwise hold onto your hat and enjoy the i loved the stewart version i 've seen it dozens of times but this film is every bit as good only different i wo n't detail the differences because it would the film also it is a pleasure to see again i 'm a huge indiana jones fan patrick is good as and the supporting cast is i find the quality of the supporting 
 this movie was terrible the first half hour is much like a well for the lack of but it was simply a bad version of a orange the first scene is almost from one of the first in supposedly it was a as per the appearance of the on the 's wall however is the more appropriate word the movie felt as though it was torn right from the classic only through a new director 's eyes a blind director 
 running man the american media complex and hits its target it may be an easy target but they pull it off none the less takes on featuring some pro as the network television the nielsen ratings the american government suggesting it 's anyway crime & punishment and a other things along the way it 's a far cry from the original stephen king and arnold is not the ben of the either but who it 's basically a with all 
 i do n't know what margaret was thinking to allow this movie to have the same name as her book i 've always been a big fan of the and was so excited to learn there was a movie in the works i am aware that the translation of book to movie is n't perfect but this movie was the worst ever the names of the women are correct and some of the back story is correct but that is 
 chances are i 'm valuable plot points while writing this and because i ca n't determine and do n't really care what you think is a valuable plot point then if you are thinking of watching this film and have an issue with learning such things then i suggest you right on to the next review you know i do n't mind the films being filed under the section and people who believe it can go there and get their 
 this film without doubt is the example of the british the germans ca n't understand run rampant in a film one of the greatest series of films in british history the story of bureaucratic amid trials enables frank to direct maximum talent from all the cast it 's probably the only film in which margaret meets her match in sim for she still wins though grenfell her and richard both deserve in 's of english and stiff upper under fan 
 season N of the series contained only three episodes and there is very little evidence of quality in at least two of the scripts based on this for the and also into murder it is not a that peter s. both the scripts he plays the part of the murdered security guard here is very rarely compelling and many of the performers just look with the material the story is rather developed with some periods of boring is also by 
 this movie was not quite as good as the but still i thought looked ' huge compared to in this film i wonder why who thought they could places like that and almost get away with it was a though and mom was a little too with head i give it any one who likes this movie check out 
 this movie brings to mind boys the to society south central and others of its and even shares actors with some of them the film 's us vs. the law mentality is underscored by the neighborhood vs. the nearly police force here the are so bad they seem like and in one scene they even the boys as they drive by in a car they 've just from its owner it 's like a from an old western but the 
 what ever martin to this film and not only did he it completely it the decision to make the character played by robert in his most performance and that 's saying a lot into a is ridiculous and of attitudes by hollywood and mr. especially attitudes that writers to think that the best way to make a character is to a on his back in any case this movie is awful 
 there are a limited number of fans for movies in the world that would love a particular to go to the that this crew has done to bring to life something that the very writer of the original film had up to this point never achieved this is a wonderful exploration of the real and love it takes to reach a potentially very successful with the from alex cox this crew began producing the of one of his movies in 
 small i just bought the of this movie yesterday i saw it with my friends and i could n't believe what had the first N movies the at least had a sense of humor especially the movie but not only did the barely ever make an appearance they were n't funny they never made me i must admit that the story did start off after an hour had gone by i remembered that the movies were always very short so 
 it 's hard to believe that a movie this bad could actually be released the was especially poor was the portrayal of the relationship between the boy and his future i guess you could say that they succeeded in producing but what was said seemed false and the just was n't there the music was about as bad as it gets the only reason i watched this movie was because i live in the death valley area and was about 
 when i out the review for this film after i 'd watched it i was surprised that there were people giving it good is a film of bad everything ' happens off screen usually accompanied with a of someone did you that well no we did n't see that we ca n't and when there were n't any the camera was doing something weird like upside down or shaking back and forth really really quickly to either convey action or 
 adapted or if it is as loose or close to the version i saw of james m. 's the always twice with jack and i ca n't be certain by first time director is no less outstanding with usage of music both and and the acting i did n't know what to expect to do in his approach to the material after seeing la and seeing how sometimes his political in a little bit but this is a totally character 
 a funny comedy from beginning to end there are several scenes but it 's also loaded with many moments which is what made the movie for me creative story line with a very cast i enjoyed it 
 an unusual film for an audience outside the usa looks and so does ralph there is not added background of tap steps as in other so you do not hear the beat of the which is great music is to hear what steps there are acting is a little and the speak slowly so that you think the movie is older than it is are for the time in the dance at the end often feels like you are part 
 i enjoyed this film which i thought was well written and was plenty of and a a warm and experience with an emotional fun 
 let 's not beat about the bush here taylor 's undoubtedly movie has little to make it stand out from the other than jamie 's performance remember the year they handed the special effects to the N they should do the same with this year 's best actor ray charles ' story is worthy of is not in dispute indeed the many to his are and used but for a life so unique the film seems and familiar it follows 
 i it so shoot me a decent sets up an otherwise story with no real but at least it 's shot well director jon takes the simple idea of a fake house with real danger inside in most cases this should be a but this little quite quickly the is above average and the acting is at best but the story and writing is just plain awful slower scenes drag on forever and the are too few and far in 
 what a movie this was i can not understand what people find so scary about the the director plays one i 'd have to admit a very good one that is brought to life very and then he it for the rest of the movie over and over again as a consequence i a few times in the first quarter of the movie but once i knew the drill i practically fell as the grew more and more predictable by 
 i watched of this movie and why it got such horrible reviews here it was fairly easy to watch at it had good casting kevin dillon 's role of the serial killer was very he was both and the rest of the main characters were n't so bad is your typical movie a married couple can not so they go to a clinic for help a genetic material on the recipients and in typical form into their i said most 
 if you are one of those people that think is all about and you have to watch this and the too for that matter even though the film does include some quite scenes of violence and a subject matter it 's not the main thing here this is a truly impressive story and murder mystery that might well be the director 's here he proves that he 's a real creating a disturbing yet beautiful filled with catholic and interesting 
 simon plays a crude and often out of control celebrity journalist who is brought from england to work for a big american magazine of course his winning ways create all sorts of amusing fact based comedy that co stars looking rather grown up danny and jeff bridges it works primarily because we like simon despite his bad behavior we completely understand why continues to talk to him despite his frequent ups i liked the film its not the be all 
 even from the very title of this movie i really love the and of one of the national islands of japan we see some great rolling green hills and some houses of a coastal town instantly we are looking at the pacific beauty on the of the theater and to prove how great this film is i have to say that charles would be proud teachers of evolution classes and school sciences such as would favor 's brand new movie 
 very rarely do i give less reviews on a show or film i dislike on but mighty power is just so it 's would n't have if this had been an would 've been better that way i guess but as a show it the terms ' and ' of which power is five wearing battle evil by using their arts skills the are they look like something that is of what track and field athletes and female would wear 
 for someone who in the daily mirror strip this film is an exercise in in that context it is wonderful but younger viewers would undoubtedly find the comedy and would miss the point that the actors are characters the is also a bit for today 's audience but reflects the of the and very well you must remember was part of the fantasy of the years created to boost the morale of the troops she gave a double meaning to 
 imagine the worst episode add even more bad taste remove humor and you might get an idea of how this movie is looks like a 's and the explosion of his little sister model house 
 this is a prime example of at its best richard greene who does good in the role search for his two missing friends takes him to the black forest and castle of count bruno stephen a past enemy of his whom he has never seen face to face incredible film has so many elements combined for once into a single film a pit a played by jr. a doctor played by a hunt very well done and very atmospheric a 
 big fat is a great watch for kids of all ages even adults i had a great time watching this movie and recommend this to kids of N years and under the never end and the plot is pretty good too is funny and is overall a made film for kids to enjoy and just have a great time 
 think of the ending of the N with the following a man who repeatedly says the word a a love story cutting herself and a and sea animals not a good movie i seriously did not enjoy it the for the movie is extremely misleading as well and i found that it was just to people into watching it i ca n't believe i went save your time and money go watch saw iii a film where the writing makes 
 first feature film from ireland is also one of the best films i 've ever seen its a real and all story that is unlike any of the other and any other film from this year or any other plot of the film has the of a village in ireland building a wall around his town to prevent the from destroying the town should they ever attack his is a young who does the best he can but meets the

 we arrived at the theater too late to see which was our intention and ' was the only film that had n't already started i had an of how bad a film it was after reading the short at the ticket counter the theater was empty when we arrived and only two other people entered before the film and director threw every sports at the audience without creating a single not one during the entire movie think of all the 
 when commenting on this film one must that it is based on a true story and must therefore be reviewed for the quality and of it 's portrayal of the events as well as its entertainment value it may well be that jack should surrender twice to jack wild because wild had captured none the less it happened it must also be noted that the director was young and which explains why he relied upon tried and tested techniques there 
 without john i have to admit that this would never even register on my but in spite of that single fact this is not a bad little considering the low budget the low quality effects the stiff acting and the sci channel aspects the blood effects are very convincing and the actually looks realistic regardless of what you think a looks like this is one from the this runs kind of like the night remember meets the love boat but 
 in today 's world of advertising and and it is very rare that one gets to see a movie and no nothing about it movies like and blair while being great in both with great build ups are by the fact that we know all about the best scenes and at least the plot before we see them with witness a rare treat i upon this film and watched it scared in the middle of the night i was scared 
 john candy and eugene levy star as security guards who chase down a big time is truly the right word for this alleged comedy a few but mostly and thoughts to yourself like why am i watching this c yes that is in this too which i am sure she want to be reminded of a waste of a cast on a scale of one to ten N 
 i ca n't figure al out i watch him in the 's way and i think i am watching one of the greatest actors of the last years then i see him in two for the money any given sunday and revolution and i wonder what the guy is on revolution a few nights ago and thought i would invest the next two hours on this here is a news want to get to talk force them to watch this

 ronald plays a son while he is not a bad guy he is a bit and has n't done a lot with his life other than travel the world and have a good time now that his latest venture in africa has failed he 's on his way home to england his rich upper class father plans on him out on his though thanks to ronald 's winning style he is welcomed back with open this point there are two 
 this and hidden are the 's that are most to me i do n't hand out N 's like candy but this certainly it if anything even though it 's quite long like all 's pretty much are it the problem which bugs me with most of his films the is often too loose and slowly containing scenes that are unnecessary or just too much without any real purpose to the or the character delivered to me the same experience 
 horrible my neighbor brought this turkey over me to it and did n't have the to the plot was my four year old could write a better movie 
 i 'm not a sports fan but i love sports so why what is a great sports this one and the style is very you are looking for a N hours of entertainment greatest game here is a movie that moves bill has gone to the same director school as ron howard happy days that is not bad look at the body of fine work that ron did after moving behind the like ron was a great actor but will 
 this movie has its ups and but to me the good stuff in this movie very much the what 's not so good about the movie are indeed sometimes the dialogue the sounds the lighting am i the only one who noticed the way the sets were was and the acting what is very good are the highly original the very intense atmosphere the factor which is very high and the effects which are done definitely worth watching or maybe 
 this is the von movie my favorite i rank it higher than breaking the waves or the latest in the dark i simply love the beauty of the picture the is so original acting is wonderful a must see 
 has the drama and character developments you would enjoy if you like drama that you and as well as writers know their material and it shows the direction is always engaging and not and the acting why this show did n't win any tells me the powers that be in do n't know drama or much else for that matter there is a plot twist in this episode at the end was a complete surprise and was very well played 
 i am not there 's a scene in this movie where a hits his head on a tunnel and with no though into a million pieces it made some kid in front of me in in a film this film might serve to convince children that santa clause is evil his are and mean when santa here an of appears all N N begin santa clause is coming to town as though it were a war then in the reflection

 i see a lot of movies saw the original years ago and loved it computers where still a big mystery for the most of us and the movie was convincing in it 's own one however looks like a low budget wednesday night special total from start to plot is so weak you wo n't believe it until you see the movie which i would not recommend in the first place i can not point out one actor that actually 
 i actually like movies i 've made it a habit to see as many as possible even the they 've done have been cool like and when a killer calls this is just plain i ca n't believe that the same people who made dead men walking and 's actually made this movie too it 's not even bad like roger or which by the way are pretty bad this is just bad i mean i can appreciate bad acting 
 the best part of this is the cover it goes down hill from there there was no chemistry between the leads the looked like something i traded with my sound was so bad that at least i was some of the 
 it is n't always easy to explain what a movie is like but this time i think i 've found it it reminded me of two movies small time criminals scoring some drugs and doing some stupid things in and the blair project because of the style of 's about the loyalty between two friends one of them is coming out of jail the other one has n't been caught yet with a stolen vehicle they drive through the scottish 
 i respect mike and liked get carter for it 's bleak outlook but the just seems like a particularly reserved cold acting is n't just the preserve of the lead character it 's spread to the entire cast meaning there is nothing to contrast owen 's character of the characters any kind of feelings at all except the ending of the film is also at best the camera work etc is fairly good but if you want to see best 
 i guess that was n't quite as as most of the movies that mystery science theater N shows but just are n't roger 's portraying rose beverly becoming in an old west town after her husband gets murdered and having to fight off the movie is pretty predictable john ireland is rose 's new working for yes the woman also appearing briefly is frequent dick miller as a miller stars in joe 's movies do wish to that you 'll 
 surely one the french films of the decade so far a atmospheric making full use of the lead characters hearing to use sound in a way rarely in gives a truly stunning performance at times and at other times open and vulnerable another reason why those who appreciate quality should keep their eyes open for offerings from france

 after reading the reviews i am so relieved to know that i am not the only person who was very disappointed in this movie i am a huge nicholas fan have read all of his books most of them more than once of course i loved the notebook and a walk to remember i have n't yet seen message in a bottle or nights in so i ca n't comment on those but i did go see john this past

 my girlfriend has the habit of going to blockbuster and choosing movies has ever heard anything about at times it has led to some fun often times the best that can be said is they definitely run an hour and a brought home advice from a caterpillar she was excited because the box said it was funny lucky for us the propaganda on the boxes never movie was an exercise in patience this is one of those movies where unless 
 an early with francis as the chasing everything in at the beginning of the film she throws back the for being too young before setting off for the the english set she moves in is such a bunch of that it 's ridiculous but the is as an italian with a my how i ever play again my is cold it 's beyond belief 
 panic in the streets is an exciting and atmospheric in which director achieved a great sense of by shooting the movie in new orleans using a number of local people to fill various roles and making use of as a result the characters and dialogue both seem very natural and an important deadline which has to be met in order to avoid a disaster provides the story with its great sense of urgency and pace and the problems which delay 
 well i only caught the end of this film on hbo just the final N minutes or so but i must say that it contains probably the most of distance running ever put on film i 'm a serious distance and a dedicated fan of the sport and i 've sat through many painful demonstrations in movies before however nothing could have ever prepared me for what is shown on screen in the final N minutes of this movie it 
 this movie was nothing like the book i think the writer of the must have wanted the job of writing the to gone with the wind and been turned down this was his or her way of getting their ideas in anyway the only similarity between this movie and the story it was portraying was the names of the principle characters and the location of the main action none of the events that are shown in the movie happened that 
 the for circle of two is an intriguing one a love between a year old richard burton and a year old girl norton and the question of whether such a relationship is acceptable given society 's standards the problem with circle of two however is that it fails to live up to its promise director and should have put more thought into the when i watched this film i expected to learn something new about love and instead i got 
 more than ups the plot was pretty decent i mean nothing out of the ordinary but it had a story unlike the other modern the other good thing was the cast i 'm not saying that the acting was good because it was n't but every was hot and of the are that the movie only become exciting after the first N minutes or so the rest was quite boring another down or you could consider it an up if 
 two battle in the fourth one brian thompson as a trying to destroy the earth the other jeffrey as a trying to save it doctor is an fantasy fare which offers plenty of plot is pretty silly and the is completely but the film is very short and if you have enough time to kill give this one a rating N out of N 
 this is a musical of 's oliver twist for the most part the original story has been maintained though for the flow of the film certain such as the summer he spent and the are omitted the biggest difference in the film and the story is that by the end of the book is an ending very different from this musical is a one of a kind musical one whose style and scope really has n't been matched before or 
 watching speak easily is painful for fans of seeing such a writer actor comic director and man to this is like seeing a used as a drop or perhaps more like seeing the with and processed into is as professor post whose is the only thing keeping him from saying tell me about the george post would have said something like inform me as to the status of the small in the family of the order kind sir who i 
 i recently was in a stage version of this play and on the last day of the run i was excited to see that it was going to be playing on tv i stuck a tape in as it was on late at night and i watched it the next day i have to say i was very disappointed the actors in the film made few of the that are in the script that is as the process is probably 
 it 's out of question that the real anderson was not apart from very distinctive differences in physical appearance anderson 's eyes are larger nose larger and turned up at the end etc anderson 's unable to speak russian was a ridiculous tell that 's why i anderson and her so much not a lot of have the and to for years with such a to some extent i have for anderson life must have been hard for a young 
 good movies from france are quite rare and it 's fairly easy to see why whenever a young releases a staggering new film he hollywood immediately after to directed the of another great film classic how can france possibly build up a solid reputation when their leave the country after just one film tension was a movie and it earned director a ticket to the states to the hills have eyes which he did i may add eric 's debut 
 i am a long time fan of 's work and for about as long as i 've known his name i 've also looked for this movie i tried looking for this movie all over california for over four years this past summer i took a trip to europe one of my on this trip was to at least see this movie long story short i bought it and watched it in france i was away it completely made my 
 ok here 's the short of it this movie is full of dialogue over the top acting and a are moments that intended to be very dramatic but simply come off because of the over the top acting and poorly written lines i could n't help laughing at moments that were meant to be very serious the bright spot in this movie is the circus seeing the circus in its was certainly a are moments that come through as good 
 this movie was recommended to me by some from their comments i had some pretty expectations but this movie was nothing but disappointing the aim of the director is obvious to use an of as a way to argue against the bush doctrine but the director fails at this also i seriously question the director 's choice of main character it 's a who is definitely not worthy of being heard the rise of corporation power so what most this 
 i 've been a fan of for many year since school this film is the best fantasy movie in years i think action is the right though there 're lot of action and wait did i mentioned this is an fantasy please keep in mind that do not use hollywood formula to rate this film and for the guy who around i do n't blame you you still young and need to know more about culture 
 first of all since i 'm one of the people who never saw the up version of this movie i ca n't comment on i did see the original version of this movie on the channel and i thought it was just as good as anything else on that channel in fact i thought it was one of their better 've noticed in the comments here that the people who write in detail about with a of intelligence and maturity 
 this a work that is with anything before or after pack and club exclusivity are not my biscuits of choice but in this world they make an the film is packed with our guys distinctive actors who add to this work with winning performances the dialogue is a in fact it 's a new one of the few films that can be watched repeatedly with include 's british ben london 's 's and the survey of ad 
 i upon this movie on cable and was totally the story of a group of who ride the big waves waves that are huge waves that would make any rational person run away in is a one that manages to be spectacular and make you understand why people spend their lives chasing waves there is nothing special about the film other than it brings together some very interesting people who are are in love with what they do and lets 
 surrender has been known for their extremely almost explicit films while they generally do very well at these N & N this particular entry seems to be just a of old tape any number of some and others not are in this film in all stages of there are also several from other films which are outstanding unless you 've seen those other films there are a number of solo scenes doing a number of things some playing basketball others

 i was excited to hear that had decided to make a movie in the language not ' as most will incorrectly refer to it as as and are as as french and spanish are to each other but i was greatly disappointed when i saw this movie being a canadian of parents i was optimistic about the revival of the film industry when i heard about this film i was further excited to hear that it was n't another stupid 
 for those of you with stewart this is one of his lesser films from later in his career and while it is n't a great film compared to many of his other pictures it is n't bad and is a decent but not much is a in new york city and for some reason she decides to cast a on poor to make him fall in love with her over time the cold and ms. also begins to fall in 
 i should live this film but i do n't it won international it is foreign i usually like such films it is slow moving again something i like and it has no sex or violence the problem is that it is boring we have two friends from the same village in turkey one successful the other not the unsuccessful one comes to to stay with the successful in an attempt to get a good job at sea both live lives 
 a disappointing end to a season that started so well exodus part N and other notable episodes were the best seen on tv in any series where as this was rather i am not sure if it was the episode that was a disappointment but the music at that accompanied the closing was and would have been more at home in the original almost as if the corporate did n't like the low key down note ending and wanted to 
 black water has to be one of the best australian movies i 've seen in many years my girlfriend and i sat each others hands jumping in all the right spots this is as much a film as open water was a film in other words the creatures are merely part of the dilemma the trap in which people find themselves through circumstances how director 's andrew and david as much and from such a modest situation is amazing to 
 from the of bruce and the film took a while to pick up from the start at least for me seeing as i expected this was a america pie but it was slightly different a who high school and makes his own college running it as you can expect there 's a lot of parties and hot in but this film tried harder than your average justin long encourages his students to learn through freedom of expression and ultimately it 
 this is the single worst movie i have ever seen let me say that again this is the single worst movie i have ever had all of the of a bad movie errors bad writing bad acting bad production value bad music i thought that there were a couple points to movies the first is that it is supposed to be enough to scare you this movie gets and f in this category the second point is that when a 
 i was so by this film that i had to write something about it so please only virtue outside of some good acting is that it does n't go on past N minutes even that length is about N minutes too have been made here to the dark ' but i ca n't see it they are two different films altogether the ' comes to an existing film is ' made in it sorry from this george roy hill ' 
 my brother is in love with this show let 's get this straight i completely agree with the people who said it was copying off of 's lab and fairly odd parents i 've never really liked fairly odd parents i mean some things did make me but most of the time it 's downright and not at all this is almost the same way i feel about test except nothing makes me on that show the are so stupid 
 while i do n't agree with bob 's and 's decision to give up baby and it 's something i 'd never do they were trying to do what was best for the baby the way this movie is written you see yourself becoming up in the story and asking yourself what you really believe from all different aspects duke almost of as far as i 'm concerned but during the movie she really you that she 's or at 
 this movie is of various bad tough guy characters connected but with no real some of the scenes are if they took the same cast and crew and made a movie called the who was the character in the film and came up with an interesting and story maybe it could be decent as it is prepare for a series of tough guy character all of whom do nothing but ride bikes around the desert all day and cause trouble 
 the concept was ok but hardly original the acting was plastic but the real was that there was only one joke and a one at that this is a film for year who have been let out on their own for the first time do n't to watch it with your kids 
 i like the cast pretty much however the story sort of rather slowly danny does a good job making you wonder if he 's the bad guy meanwhile the other characters are just part of the story dennis did n't have as much room in the story as he could have had i thought the first scene was a bit over the top grim compared to how the story i 'd watch it again though i rated it a N 
 ok so here 's the basic plot it is N peter sellers is a N year old chinese man who has lived quite a long time the film opens with his birthday in which he by drinking a special that even the film never his life well on this occasion the is dropped by an assistant if you remember the movies and he orders his to then go find N rare items to make the this creates a global man 
 the combination of reading the and this film has inspired my wife and i to new levels recently i was a statement made by the artist thomas in one of his books he states you and i were not designed to the air of five traffic nor do i think god had television programs media purchases and soul pollution in mind when he created the universe i had n't seen a river runs through it in a couple of years 
 is a and interesting to those all star musical pictures that every studio was putting out during the world war ii years when you 've got such stars as gary james day gordon and scott etc. in the film and with such people as the brothers porter and supplying the music it 's an easy to take film and the plot is n't even in the plot there is involves two air force men dick and ron trying to meet 
 i saw this film at the tender age of N with a group of friends its reputation had it and though all my friends were also of legal age i alone had the to enter the video store and actually rent it we gathered at a house where the parents had left town for the weekend though we sat in close to each other we did not speak or otherwise acknowledge each other 's presence as it turned out the 
 extremely drama a very young who trains a wild horse the of the title and is the only reason for watching the movie in the first place coated in music and weighed down by dialogue this is one of those films that you to the point of a the son of ' in which trains the next generation of is marginally better than the original but the pace remains slow and the score continues to you into although there are 
 unfortunately one of the best efforts yet made in the area of special effects has been made completely by being placed alongside a silly and equally plot and an inadequate man is a rather everything seen here has been done to death the characters the idea and the action especially the lift with the only intriguing element of the film being the impressive special effects however it is just the same special effect done over and over again and by 
 this movie was well acted and kept my interest in the main character for the entire movie lived an extraordinary life imagine if were alive today this movie a picture of what 's life might have felt like it was interesting to see how connected was growing up i would have liked to seen more detail on 's his and his relationship to bob but all in all this movie was well done well acted and the story touched on 
 the mood of this movie is pretty good and it the feel of the N 's well with some good the script is run of the mill with the exception of a couple of moments and comes off as being weird where i expect it was intended to be the characters are totally over and and full of right that the script writer probably saw watching a on the national front the biggest problem is this movie has no real 
 i got a good reading all the comments for this film as it 's obvious that those people who criticized the movie never seen it or were stupid enough to pay to see best reason to watch was on the show a few years back delivered the movie with as many as one 's an ok monster compared to the hundreds of american made way better 
 i was excited at the concept of my favorite comic book hero being on television and disappointed at the end only amazing thing was the wall despite the of the cable i did n't think hammond was peter parker and he was of a different build than the guy who did the in the suit you could tell they were two different i can also spot in the modern movies when i am looking at and when i am looking 
 this was a movie i came across by accident i was through and saw it was on showtime so i watched it now i watch it at least once a month this is a movie that is filled with that might cause some people to trash it do n't listen to people that hate this movie if they want an action movie with expensive they should have a movie that promises them if you are in the mood for a 
 ok the helicopter shots are and the director made good use of some of 's top sights otherwise production value was in the first few minutes and the rest of the film felt like a movie of the week was and fun to watch folk had the most and was very effective and william baldwin was well william baldwin he got to put his art training to good use and be a action figure the rest of the cast was 
 movies tend to be bad so i 'm not inclined to watch them however there were some good commercials on the channel so i decided to watch a climbing heads into the pacific northwest to find a a fallen carrying the daughter of the 's leader played by and have brought a revolutionary dna that could be used to prove the 's existence and it actually generates some at first the is but sees the mountain ' body heat like 
 you know the movie could have been a lot better when the animal in this case a little dog is the best actor on the screen the acting in this film is so bad so by dog got embarrassed watching this he our golden could have done a better job than the people in now this is almost a story kid finds animal pet is not liked nor wanted by one of the parents but the pet up saving one 
 the real surprise of this movie is how such a top cast got assembled for what is nothing more than a affair presumably it was a rolling down a hill gathering pace and size and shape one can imagine that by the time got contacted by her agent the conversation went along the lines of you want to shoot a movie in by neil jordan michael and michael are already in ' this is a ' that sees michael and 
 anyone who has studied any physics or science will walk out after N as my wife and i did the might be by the arguments and the absurd conclusions drawn without even an attempt at a logical reason from real science i 'm by such nonsense presented under the of science i can only conclude that the writers picked up a quantum physics book did n't understand a word of it then watched the about a thousand times and to 
 if you hate you 'll hate this movie and to make it worse you see patrick a has been trying to be a i really ca n't stand i like bob he was good in but he was in this movie and what kind of name is how much more can this movie get the was stupid i 'm usually not this of movies but i could n't stand this movie if you want a good bob movie go see 
 it 'll soon be N since this movie was released still makes me if u enjoy this film try the new as and my bit of the film must be when that he has no bullets left in his gun while he has the upper hand and has everyone at gun point and he actually says it out loud u just him but u know u can only do that if u stop laughing film 
 is obviously just a for stanley to be a deep doctor unlike house he has absolutely no and unlike grey 's the brain surgery cases even interesting this is supposed to be set in a leading for cases yet there 's nothing interesting or exciting going on not even the so called ' between him and a rival adds anything to the show and neither do those in the pilot there was a brief into the leads 's social life 
 do n't see this this was one of the movies i have ever seen its hard to be sometimes when there are movies like this out there what a sad view of life i can tell you if you did see this movie that it is not all like this at all in a ward if it was i do n't think i would have made it through it its too bad that most movies are made by a group 
 oh what fun there is here has a for comedy fast times at high look who 's talking but here it looks like she told the actors to go out and have fun through the role of easily his best screen performance joe is great as the named danny what a shame directors did n't pick up on this and i have even mentioned richard playing and the character 's unique i do n't think it 's an accident that 
 i can agree with other comments that there was n't an enormous amount of history discussed in the movie but it was n't a it was meant to and i think it did a very good job at agree with the black family the scenes with them seemed out of place like all of a sudden it would be thrown in but i did catch on to the story and the connection between the families later on and found it 
 i with what has said the movie is portrayed in a way which appears to be a kind of on the original content are n't properly i guess a couple of performances also contributed to its in my view would have been a much better choice for such a role instead of in some of her scenes she looks a bit which is not ultimately what the movie should have portrayed i also noticed a bit of in some of 
 true story of three who go into the of connecticut and end up by a in the woods this is the sort of film that would have played in the drive across america years ago to mixed not particularly much of anything the film works with its low budget to mixed results the film is but is n't at all scary blame how some of the attack scenes for that its the sort of film that you 'll probably forget 
 this era was not just the of sound in but of a character which would go down in history as the world 's most famous mouse yes makes his debut here in this tale of life on board a the is good for it 's time and the plot though a little simple is quite a true classic and if you ever manage to get it on video you wo n't regret it 
 this movie is terrible it 's about some no brain that some company does top have no shame 
 all in all big bad john was a and movie if you want tragedy and humor this movie 's got it if you 're a fan of the song like i am you pretty much know how it ends but if you do n't or do and want to watch it anyway i strongly recommend this movie jack and dean are a pair with great chemistry however i would n't recommend this movie to strict urban folk you have to 
 i always say there 's nothing like a good movie and i must say this was nothing like a good movie and it was like one of those bad dreams that never seem to end no matter how hard you try to wake up i do n't mind the concept of a film without words entering a fantasy or dream world but there has to be something there to capture your not just empty images which is what this film 
 i a few times during this movie i out loud during the of the company intended are three segments in this movie the first one is supposed to be a of woman up ' and career movies the box was the thing in this segment most of the cast members are n't listed here on they are the lucky ones few other people will be able to this thing to the of their acting second segment is a of woman 
 run do not walk away from this movie aimed at the very young kids this movie will you to if the of the N 's raised the bar this film just lowered it it 's slow and the monster fighting is good but seldom seen this movie had me dry in the cat box just a very poor offering after a N 's beyond this point here are the top N reasons fans of the N 's series will hate 
 apart from carter there is nothing worthy about this movie and the surprise ending the thought of a is even more save your money wait for the video and ignore that too 
 letters with no end up in another world found in the back rooms of the post office here alice manages to land a job in hope of finding her lost father what she does discover is the soul of her boss frank a quiet little that came and went at the now you find it in the deep dark corner of the video shop by copies of that film it 's a shame because this turned out to be a 
 it 's a real big that people easily are able too make movies because of cheap digital video usually i would appreciate this possibility but if you see movies like this it 's just a big shame and it 's also big shame if people like get abused by the likes of this i this movie of the drop on it and i 'm a big fan of many of his mainly those done by brian & stuart gordon this 
 its no wonder this was free with the mail on sunday slow going poor acting and camera near start of movie is not even artistic straight to video but not in this case why not recoup some of your film production costs by it free with a sunday newspaper at least this way you get a audience and recover some have not given this film a N out of N due to the effort to pull some old actors out 
 sam 's excellent pick up on south street is the pick of the bunch from a number of early N 's cold vehicles with a running length of under N minutes pick up on south street is tough explosive and stars as who has already been picked up three times yet ca n't keep his fingers out of and trouble is exactly what he into when he the of 's candy jean peters candy 's contains a roll of to 
 this N version of the ' classic a christmas carol ' directed by stars george c. scott as by this time around the challenge for the was to take such familiar material and make it seem fresh and new again and to say with this film not only met the challenge but any expectations anyone might have had for it he tells the story with precision and an eye to detail and performances from his actors that are nothing less 
 i really enjoyed doctor this is a film which may be to some but i have no problem with it i it even more for that considering it 's way more entertaining than the that hollywood out every year too bad this did n't get a theatrical release i do n't know about anyone else but i would have went to see it in doctor ' is a very entertaining science film that just about anyone can enjoy especially if 
 a bunch of medical student get together in their spare time to hook each other to the electrical and die then they stand around counting the time before brain death and then start and and bring each other back to life the fact that roberts was in this movie should say it all is like group ghost everyone wants to see their dead and visit their old dead so what better way to do it than have a bunch of 
 if you liked blair with you 'll like this one it has the same and and it has the same plot and also has tom so if you like 's of the dead or and ' from till you 're in for a treat he is an and a very good actor as seriously this movie is definitely the movie i 've seen in a long time and i 've seen quite a few movies bad ones as well i 
 although i am generally a of the film i do not limit myself to films which escape those and more often than not i do enjoy and films that successfully break the rules and it is quite true that director breaks the rules of established but it is also my opinion that he does not break them successfully or to any actual 's work is but this is less a matter of what is actually on the screen than how 
 after a couple years of searching for the bogart film two against the world it unexpectedly showed up as a offering under the title one fatal hour a first national film from 's character is scott the man who runs a radio station whose program lineup is losing the owner reynolds robert is a executive who calls the shots at the station but behind his decisions by them off on an effort to boost the audience base and revenues reynolds 
 i really really enjoyed watching this movie at first seeing its i thought it was just another easy romantic comedy but it is simply more than this i personally believe that this idea that i 'm sure a good part of the viewers had just before they saw the movie it 's yet another important part of the big concept of this movie itself or even of its marketing strategy what i mean is we are to images to i 
 the humor implicit in the complete title from the sunday school that one would be better advised to prepare before you 're dead for the 's scrutiny so the does n't care when you 're dead there 's no percentage in trying to beat the the characters apparently did n't pay attention at sunday school and find themselves forced into crisis management having crisis but even a ceo would have difficulty managing these crises throwing is far more than a 
 this movie was awful in the worst way you just did n't care you did n't care what happened in the plot you did n't care about the characters everyone was of heart i ended up walking out about an N minutes into it because i simply did n't want to subject my mind to it any more there is far too much sex in the film sex can be it can even make the movie hence but the here 
 some slack might be cut this movie due to the fact that it was made in that much said it really is pretty mind the or the awful awful of supposed it 's the that the pulls off that will have you in at the and violent left me wondering why the of the world did n't just fly as their main here are the important i learned from this the is at least as as a N you can 
 here comes another movie to keep the happy if the opening credits do n't tell you you 're in for quite a ride then the writing sure kid gets tied on to a legendary as part of his onto the baseball team then the goes and starts people need i say more this movie consists greatly of cheap effects that makes it look like it was with note that color and actors who apparently were n't good enough to show 
 i thought this film was excellent and different to the usual run of the mill catching serial killer ' film was brilliant as usual i really do n't think i have seen anything that he has done where he has not acted the dialogue was funny at times the mood and the plot engaging thanks to other for showing the link with alice in i had n't picked up on those i would recommend this film to anyone who is 
 do n't waste your time on this as portrayed the characters have no values and watching them is sheer was entertainment at least this is if you like watching and to each other this may be right up your alley lord is portrayed as a complete and why the others would choose to spend more than five minutes with him is truly mary appears to be the only character with any but even she comes out of the whole without 
 the unlikely duo of zero and harry team up to give us some interesting performances and subject matter in the levine it 's one interesting twist on the themes from it 's a wonderful is married to and the two of them belong to a special class of elderly jewish poor in new york used to be a and proud of his trade but his back and have prevented him from working is mostly he 's reduced to applying for 
 i just ca n't believe some of the comments on this show the show is just sure it does n't follow the tried and true but do we as consumers always want the same things thrust at us over and over again should n't we have the option to sit back and enjoy something new once in a while the style is not as realistic as previous shows but it 's not supposed to be the show it titled and 
 brilliant execution in once and for all this time in the of politics of how good intentions do actually the road to hell excellent 
 just read the original story which is written by in century the movie the original spirit very well though the plot was modified the film language the the special effect are all from hollywood but still there is a chinese core it is amazing how managed to combine them together the result is pure beauty 
 one of the many silent laurel featured in before he with oliver and sand ' is a the story is badly though this could be because of the and the humor itself is not at all are started and ignored for instance 's promise to make de sole pay for what she 's done to him never comes to 's character does n't seem very centered either but this is a common criticism of his work before he developed ' 
 john hughes covered all bases as usual with this sunday afternoon family movie sue is a sweet for from by bill the pair live off their as they travel the great us of a. fate matches them with a very pretty lawyer and the rest is will love this film as they can to the played by N year old who went on to be the you go girl of pepsi commercials the character is supposed to be about N 
 i do n't mean to above that only a few people should avoid almost every group would be by this production it 's a little like the N 's batman tv series except it 's not funny even you 're better off taking a 
 weak tale of an evil who is searching for a centuries old so that he can do 's bidding by creation hot in pursuit all the way is a hunter named and his reluctant sound like a load of it from writer gets the treatment it deserves from director steve who that romantic nonsense forever young obviously knows nothing about true just flies around and trying to look evil while richard e. grant succeeds only in his rich talent singer 
 the is still every day on dutch television around and i still watch it i do n't like the i absolutely them it is just great to see justin chasing the former members of brings back memories from the old days when i was young an sweet i would have given you a N for excellent but justin looks like he is chasing the former members all by himself of course that is the only bad thing on this too 
 a but funny bit of diversion you kind of have to see it from the beginning to follow what 's happening but each report to earth has it 's own little joke pretty good special effects for a very low budget show it 's fun to watch sort of in the of red but even more low budget for someone who 's just coming in in the middle of one of the episodes what you have to realize is that 
 ok so some of the plot points might be a bit obvious but over all an interesting idea which works a tight ending the acting is solid particularly who plays one of the central characters in this piece he certainly has a screen presence and he is interesting to watch it has a low budget feel which works for the sort of four belongs to the film does n't try to take itself to seriously which adds to the overall 
 i really do n't think it 's necessary that i write a review on a movie with a title as as island but even in the of its own this hit a new low so my anger must be known the only reason why i even bothered to watch this bad movie is because i knew it was going to be bad it was really late at night i could not sleep and in the past really bad movies would 
 i can and say that in all my N years on this planet that is the worse children 's film i have ever seen in my took my three grand children to see it and even they were struggling to raise a during the all N the sexual i will leave for another day but they were as as the film they should pay you to watch it not you pay them it 's truly truly awful there is no

 here on i read an opinion that grey is best character of ever performed i do not know if he had better nor worse roles i 'm not his fan but this one was really other thing impressive hand of the movie director i give my respect the the beauty and spirit of was illustrated really i never met such it in any movie thing left in my mind after the film this is the movie to the original books 
 i have read several reviews that ask the question why was this film made i myself found that question looming in my mind as the hour and minute feature seemed to drag near the middle only to give off the that it was picking up steam at the end when in it was doing nothing of the sort so why was this film made i think that is a great question for those watching to ask themselves this is proud 
 i out this video expecting to like it wanting to like it i like foreign films i like beautiful i know the critics liked this film including my favorite roger and i do n't mind slow it 's beautiful that 's about the best i can say for it the plot is very thin the shots are very long the are very meaningful the actors are very and it seems like a very long movie i fell half way though 
 there are those who that this is not the opera but then they do n't with the film of that was not the original show either all films of are and have to be or they do n't work took more with the original show than did the film of and and yet it kept its original integrity the material and is an artistic success the same holds true for and it the opera into a because audiences at the 
 when i saw that this movie was being shown on tv i was really looking forward to it i grew up in the N 's and like everyone else who has grown up in that era have seen every N 's and summer camp movie out there so i could n't wait to see this movie that totally that film what a disappointment the movie was nothing but a bunch of really bad jokes and over and over with hardly 
 a couple of weeks after i saw this movie it began to me of john carpenter 's in the mouth of not for the story for the atmosphere the fast elements of surprise and the on the other hand this movie very well the image and the music note the chapter in the movie 
 for my first taste of shakespeare on stage i can not believe what these people did to a perfectly good play 's start off with the good bit shall we is although some of his could have been delivered with more feeling the rest of the actors needed to pull it together art not dead yet the actor while not only completely wooden and could not read his lines with any at all he was completely out of focus had 
 martin has been sent on a classified mission into cambodia during the vietnam war to as he has gone completely and is no longer taking orders and since is one of the most men in the armed forces it is hard for to understand how col. could go off the deep end as he has killing without clearance and taking the war into his own hands what possibly could have pushed this great man over the top through 's long 
 i liked this movie because it basically did more with less it could have been made more interesting if they had kept it confined to the studio even more though some of the plot elements would have been harder to develop guy playing the did a good job of showing someone spooked out and by his memories i also found his with the callers pretty parts of the movie you can see coming a mile away other parts you do 
 this was a very good movie i i could find it in to buy i really enjoyed this movie i would recommend this movie to watch i would like to see it again but can never find it in tv it would be well worth the time to watch it again 
 i have barely managed to view the entire film only after about out of the movie 's did the to begin and then there were left for the these N long minutes were very boring and did n't contribute anything to the film when finally reaching it was n't much better plot it all could have been into much shorter running time and nothing would have been i can not understand is the piece of saying the because of the 
 this movie is excellent not because it does anything special or new but because it is consistently great in all of its parts no part stands out as being or but all parts are far above and that makes to me an excellent own several copies of this movie and may acquire it on collectors or someday holding off right now due to high prices and of course the face that i do n't have a player but that 's 
 the marriage of maria is about a german girl maria getting married to a german just at the ending of the war after being married for half a day and a night is send to the front again to make ends meet maria starts working at a bar for mainly american soldiers and get to know a black she got word that died at the front and things develop between her and the american walks in on them in bed 
 after seeing the movie last night i was left with a sense of the faced by trying to tackle the problem the film the scale of the seems so large that it 's hard to see how it can be defeated without major changes in on with the it is a movie with an uncomfortable central relationship this is a very compelling film and i 'd even go so far as to say it was the film was well for 
 a couple of years back i had purchased and enjoyed the mgm of the two tv movies the night N and the night N when the universal set of the subsequent tv series came out i had intended to buy it immediately but rumors of issues with the kept me from adding it to my collection recently i placed an order which of a spate of discounted universal box sets and decided to pick up the as watched it now 
 this movie just felt very true to life i liked the ending which seemed to resolve naturally without any big moments but with a lot of little moments coming together you could tell it is an honest love story it does n't matter what the ' of the main characters are it still a story about love and were a lot of scenes that involved the family the setting is during what for some people is a very time namely 
 minor follow steve allen that humor about serious events might be found by many to be acceptable based on the formula N before the german assault on poland was hardly a fun period and subsequent events including the following the which took germany to the channel resulted in the evacuation at and gave the world the of a france its honor before the stuff of comedy and a big of serious drama director with a and outstanding cast creates in 
 in its way originally and more titled i ca n't see addressing its title character as is a to good acting both jamie bell as a attractive and as kate his partner in sex and fantasy are convincing the problem comes when you try to their roles to anything that happens in real life a young man who on the intimate details of people 's lives the way does would be beaten to a pulp and a woman in kate 
 i read a small ad in some magazine in the early about des the love of the dead or something similar this of course my so i ordered N & N and the death king the movies are ok even kind of interesting and unique in their approach to the subject even if they obviously are rather than intended to fear in the viewers mind they are actually quite funny on the other hand is in my opinion one of 
 if you want to watch a real ' movie get hold of the formula this film must have cost all of $ N to make it features a thin script bad sets lighting and camera work and a stop motion monster that is utterly it looks like they sometimes used a guy in a rubber suit a for the monster but all were equally the actors all speak their lines as though they 've never seen them before and are 
 this movie was made N years before my time its introduction of john in the supporting role of makes it a classic he onto the screen and your eyes are was an original and his portrayal of fate 's boy is a must see 
 i have loved this movie since i first saw it in i 'm still at how accurately kurt russell right down to how he moves and the on his face sometimes its scary how much he looks acts and talks like the real this is being released on so all of us that have been waiting can finally have an excellent quality version of the full length film i have heard the who say that there are some or some 
 i watched this show on the basis of it being told it was of david lynch 's a show which i the show quickly starts introducing us to the main characters and rather unusually the pilot episode is to me the best of the lot its extremely dramatic and really gets out the whole evil side of the show ready to progress throughout the rest of the season my one biggest criticism is i felt a little let down by 
 do n't even ask me why i watched this the only excuse i can come up with that i was sick with and too weak to change the channel it 's too terrible for words the movie that is not the the acting is richard it up as a serial killer with a for knocking off mancuso phones in a performance as the on his trail and nancy allen manages to put in the only sympathetic role in the entire 
 yes this is a film and it was a lot of fun that 's because although the film clearly was some of the stories had a light spirit and there were even occasionally a few this is n't at all a bad thing as sometimes films are a bit and overly serious because of this and because all four of the stories were pretty good it 's one of the better movies of this style i have theme that each 
 this is perhaps the display of santa ever committed to any medium whether it be a book a picture or a movie santa looks like a looking down on the children and the story of bringing in to help him defeat one of 's pitch does n't make things any better it 's to say the least with bad effects even for N standards if a kid were to watch this movie he 'd have and never want santa to

 is actually a step up in terms of what the original movie was in story and in special effects scott lee is good as a hunter looking for the count himself if you remember him he was from the movie the bruce lee story ' london is funny as the kid who helps the woman he from a far steal 's body from the neal is good as the woman who 's body in order to finds a cure for 
 this is simply the worst movie i 've ever seen neither of the three central characters has any and 's good looks are n't enough to carry the film the plot i 've ever had upon me also the most military comedy ever why did they bother 
 russell my is in this film but more than that the film covers a tremendous range of human passion and everything from marriage to is addressed and respected the film makes the realize that of other humans provides the route to saving love story between and i their scenes over and over again anyone who has ever been in love will with these people all characters are cast and portrayed 
 this little is of several other movies but manages to keep its own style & mood & do n't be afraid of the dark come to mind the builders were good & just cross the line from to i especially liked the choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the but the writing in this movie made better if you want a movie that 's not gross but gives you some this is a great choice 
 i 've never watched a file in a language i do n't understand just because i wanted to see the movie and i could n't find it with english i do n't know how much i missed but it was n't much probably just specific details which sounds silly until you see the emotional level of this movie and how the characters together i want to mention to the from germany there 's no reason to feel that he ' 
 this movie was absolutely brilliant i really do n't know why everyone says it has a slow pace i thought the pace was perfect the movie is about michael sullivan played by tom with who is a sort of killer working for john paul he this job but does it because for his house and helps him financially he had nothing and mr. gave him everything but his children are that this is his job and when one witnesses a

 season after season the players or characters in this show appear to be people who you 'd absolutely love to hate is this show to be that or were they chosen for the same each episode one single person specifically and he ends up getting killed off you enjoy seeing them get although its totally wrong and sick you enjoy seeing them others getting themselves playing getting it back and finally getting kicked out by trump the amount of also 
 steve 's effort following upon the wildly breaking away is a of and perhaps he lived some of this if so i 'm sorry to say he was unable to any of it fairness he 's not helped much here by arthur penn a director who 's done remarkable work in the past and little big man but fails to any energy or into 's the cast struggles as best they can but are with weak and dialogue should be 
 it 's a bad season for with all the big releases with a massive surrounding proving to be at the box office london dreams is no exception to that let 's it it 's all about chasing your dreams and how far will you go to achieve it sounds impressive right but unfortunately the film is is an who wants to make it big someday his dream is to perform in stadium in front of a N N audience calling

 before i start i should point out that i know the editor of this film we 've never met but we belong to the same those things which came before message boards and we have talked on the phone so i do have a bias here anyway somehow it 's ironic how while the pack culture of the late N 's and early to 's made a comeback in the 's this movie from the son of one of the

 i should no longer be surprised when critics miss the most obvious things in works of art because they are human beings and the vast majority of human beings are by nature that said the notion that 's great N film shame or is merely an film does a great deal of damage to the reputation of this very complex and highly film compared to its more and hour of the wolf shame is seemingly a more classic film in

 seeing as the vote average was pretty low and the fact that the clerk in the video store thought it was just ok i did n't have much expectations when this contrary to the above i enjoyed it a lot this is a movie it did n't need to grow on me i enjoyed it from the beginning brooks gives a great performance as the lead character i think somewhat different from his usual in his 's not a lot 
 the movie is excellent acting direction and music are it seems to me that the reason so many give the movie a low score is because of the they have to the original N version ronald coleman that movie for good reason an level of commitment from talking with people who saw the original when it first came out i believe the impact was something to the first movie in modern times i have seen it it was and is 
 total truly awful the and dialogue is a joke and combined with a director who does n't have a clue about life in saudi arabia it 's not a surprise quite saudi film the director is the writer is the lead actress is and the shooting took place in and all those elements show very well to make the film far from representing the saudi society yes it contains some saudi 's the stuff we see in in the newspapers 
 this movie is a very which is does a very good job as the of albert though she does believe in her own skills tim does an equally good job as the who falls in love with her when she comes into his shop with her after her car up i loved walter as the one and only albert this movie just has a very feel to it while still keeping some sort of to it if that is actually 
 i have really nothing to add to all the other comments save this to me the film looked like a silent film slowly being adapted to sound the text boards bringing the story along reinforced that impression i along the way the actors were allowed to leave the acting very much looks like a typical early silent movie at the beginning of the film but at the end is allowed the reminded me of the comic characters of shakespeare plays 
 ben masters thomas dream plays a sort of mike character a private eye who does any old job for a buck and never misses out on all the of good looking makes one big mistake when he stops morgan arizona summer from getting beaten up and takes home to his and when he up she is out on his eating his eggs and orange and making herself right at home by the way sleep in his bed and on the

 i saw this film last night at a special movie theater showing in and it was i do have to admit that the original music of the player and player influenced the mood of the film but the film itself also had force in its portrayal of the you are interested in silent films or in the i highly recommend this film the were and creative the sets were and exotic and the acting was dramatic and as is typical

 warning this may contain first of all i watch a lot lifetime movies and realize they are just that lifetime movies some are great really some are good and some are bad unfortunately this movie falls into the latter category it actually started out with some potential single hard working mom who gets out of work at N N am cuts a guy off while driving home from work and let 's just say he does n't take it too 
 beautiful with some fine music this film otherwise has a fairly quality the between two characters which a cultural and educational divide is simply not of course from early on we knew our would up win over the and find true love but that does n't make it any less that the movie had to take such completely expected turns this film had lots of promise which makes it more of a shame that the promise was perhaps a nice 
 i doubt if the real story of the development of western union would ever have gained a real audience instead of talking about the building of the telegraph system out west it was the story of board rooms dominated by one of the most interesting and of the great jay gould gould picked up the struggling company and turned it into a communication giant and part of his attempt at a national railway system to rival 's but this while

 the mystery of was a two-part star historical movie based on the peter book the of anderson it keeps up historically pretty much names are changed etc but to the real story quite well and do quite well as the russian nicholas and what stuck out in my mind was the all too short by harrison and de all in all it was a pretty production with some fine acting i was quite by the production values when it first 
 henry thomas and robin are a couple of the most performers in the business it 's beyond me as to why they have n't received more recognition than they have this movie is a perfect example of how their out the lives of folks who could be referred to as a bit odd seems to be their and if these characters ai n't odd i 'm at a loss to find anyone who story is funny romantic dramatic complicated and

 this movie is a good example of how to a book in N minutes except for the names of the characters the movie bears very little to the book a book full of strong characters and they are represent for the most part by there is no character development in the movie and we have no reason to love or hate the characters and to a complete generation is has written a powerful book and the book is what should 
 before i start i need to inform you that i love films with a passion love them i have seen thousands and rarely does one come along that i do not like i am very of the one of the greatest lines in movie history is in the film ed wood where ed wood out and at the overly critical producers after they comment on plan N 's cheap sets and problems you do n't know anything have n't you 
 it 's a fight between two brothers dennis and howard both of whom can fires they square off over differences with caught in the middle director glenn gordon the tv behind the comedy in 's with a presentation so the movie resembles an entry from an film student on a grant it has the energy of a big commercial feature but a style which brings out nothing from the characters except their these are n't even characters they 're plot 
 another why on earth do they keep making these this has got to be the weakest ' ever yet it is still being funded and gone wild which i only watched so i could officially trash the whole series brings back the evil who again up some college kids that 's basically it the acting as usual the death scenes are beyond and do n't be by the title this thing does n't have as much as you may think

 one of the best films i 've seen in a long time precise in its vision and beautiful and highly in its i ca n't say much without giving it away and i do n't recommend you actually read that much about this movie before seeing just see one must come up with ten lines of text to have a review listed on what can i do tell you about the film ca n't do it i think i enjoyed 
 this movie was obvious and predictable the scenes were poorly written and acted even worse following the horrible scenes was the terrible script filled with and poorly thought out lines i would never suggest this movie to anyone who would have any sense in watching decent movies this movie was not only with the same ideas as the show the and but also contained many parts in which you would know what the next move and line was going to 
 this program would be useful for training basic human beyond this purpose the show has no value other than to fill that would otherwise go in the spectrum i feel a greater sense of and anticipation listening to a computerized voice chip out the products of a random number fortunately the helpful and frequent music will tell viewers how they 're supposed to feel in case they are unable to fully the predictable and plot line i did find to 
 i watched this film on the advice of a friend who assured me it was one of the things he 'd ever seen this person is completely lacking a sense of and i was forced to endure two hours of the worst film making i have ever seen please do not watch this film 
 i supposed gone wild ' is a yes it have some good point but it 's a from another the acts is so awful nor the plot the story goes from a about a living on the when an become a and cause the life a boy in jeopardy the comes alive and start a killing frenzy sound familiar right it 's derived from friday children of the corn you name it gone wild ' is so below average film 
 first of all i saw this movie without knowing anything about it i just knew that joel did it and that was enough for me a friend and i went to see it at a film festival called the festival which is a lot of different movies shown after hours the festival pretty much specializes in showing movies that would n't otherwise be shown in my friend and i went to see it and we were at how real it 
 this tale of is simply not very interesting even with ed in a role as the chief heavy jim brown effectively proves again that she can bring life to even the poorest roles and peters is decent as the who plays by the book it 's still and badly constructed and even the print shown on cable is now of its original james brown score 
 i feel very strongly that this film was just like waiting to with white in the N 's as in waiting to all of the female characters got mixed up with men who were either married or no good the only difference besides the obvious was that there was n't much humor in this film i would even say that it was only one of the male characters seemed to be kind and hope 's guy but even then there 
 this film is interesting light is literally thrown in a way together with and an introduction before the titles that had my hopes up at the start but then a is a is a no matter how much is seen this film the life of albert fish one of the most well-known in the world active around the start of the century fish 's life is hastily and dealt with before before he started killing children at an old age 
 romantic comedy is not the correct way to describe how to lose friends & people the underlying in the plot is for the most part by a far more interesting to tale although the central line of the story is somewhat rushed passed in several screen shots it does have a sense of getting the out of the way focusing on those key relationships which make office politics and using those almost irrelevant scenes used for comic effect yet it 
 of the of facts queen is a true story its true because the themes it deals with hold as much truth today as they did way back in this movie is violent powerful and thought is a woman of and blood whose brought out the best or worst out of her keeping the aside there is no doubt that 's character from a young girl of N who is married off by her father to clear a debt intended to 
 the consequences of love there is really something special about this film but it 's very hard to put your finger on it is a love story of sorts but not really one i 've seen before it has several love themes running throughout the film one love for a younger woman a younger love for his older brother the love of money at all costs these are just some that in a story that has you or rather not

 things i like steve as the part copies robert which makes him feel comfortable to fans some of the other actors copy their style in this series as well urban looks grim and tough but can crack a joke and too which did in original series the gear the guns the clothing all accurate or very close to period accurate i 'll never and for having a in their in open range the they are actually riding rather than a

 this is one movie that will take time to get out of your head once you have seen it the are close to perfect which was to be expected as it has been adapted from a play the actors are simply giving their best the story is simple and attractive N minutes of pure is totally credible in his role is still the beautiful but not so providing as much pleasure to the eyes as to the is providing an 
 a stunning film which brought into the open so much about that generally makes people afraid it showed how minds can be captured by less than willing bodies and how difficult it must be to witness things happening to others that are wanted for the disabled friendship fear frustration and so many others things were so well captured the N lead characters were very well played by the N able actors and invited your concern and approached this film with 
 i found this movie to be filled with irony but watching the movie you can almost for see what will happen is a confused house wife who is constantly looking for when she thinks she finds true she onto it leaving behind all that she knew but she finds her almost notes between her and her current husband she learned that if she only had more about what had bothered her in her previous marriage that it could have been 
 although in some aspects seven pounds is solid and interesting in some of its style 's project is rather the movie becomes more and more and as it move toward the end hearts human and emotional eyes physical and seven pounds is more of an of 's and N with lots and lots of the problem is the story is quite predictable from very easily on through the movie that 's too bad because seven pounds could have been as 
 gordon scott made some good movies but this is not one of i watched it at the bad obviously interior sets and the wooden sounds as they walked across supposedly trails and at the bad and worse acting among the supporting cast i kept thinking this is tv show level then i find out it was indeed three tv show pilot episodes into 's nice to see scott get outside alone away from the sets in a few of the

 where to start with ' the true story of richard a killer of eight nurses in the director keith has worked on a few of the extremely low budget full moon movies such as birth and here works from a script by at the time full moon regular don adams the film seems like a accurate portrayal of the crime the script is n't great perhaps because the real 's were not interesting despite the care that has been taken 
 this was n't the greatest movie i 've ever seen in my life despite the fact that it 's lower budget it 's a pretty decent movie though the are unique and they 're even kind of scary in the scenes where they show them briefly havoc on this poor family although when you finally do get to see the completely you really think those things are after them the only part that really me is when they killed the 
 i for one really like this movie for some reasons i 'll go into late but i want to touch on why i think people do n't like it first off there are people out there who just like to hate tom cruise i do n't understand it really second i think successfully off two groups of with this film the casual not looking to think too hard group of are left confused when the plot takes a complete N

 this movie started off well enough sticking to the mood of the book fairly well even if the acting was not top the was bad and electric it was the female singer was in the second half of the film the story takes a turn too dark for is made a dark and scary place in the book it was and to 's in the is this with the makeup and a totally and unnecessary of the key elements in

 jeopardy is a a cut above a b but not really a major production it as almost an experimental film as the studio that produced it was desperately looking for new kinds of films stars and directors to compete with the then new medium of television the director john was an whose best years lay ahead he had just recently begun a level films and had already proved himself a most capable stars barbara barry sullivan and ralph were at

 i saw it at a german press without giving too much away most critics really seemed to like it very much there was even applause which is quite unusual for that from my point of view and until now it was the movie of the year it keeps the and of the three and it is with many to these and other movies of course there are obvious to and especially to an american in london king kong and even 
 the plot for if it actually can be called a plot has two events one near the beginning one at the end together these events make up maybe N of the total movie time everything and i mean in between is basically the director 's desperate effort to fill in the minutes i like disturbing movies i like dark movies and i do n't get troubled by scenes but if you expect me to sit through N minutes of literally

 i caught this movie on the channel and was quite impressed by the film 's atmosphere and tone as a big fan of all things related i am always happy to see a new of the in this case a in a other the director has done a brilliant job of the dark mood of the subject using the art scene as a backdrop to what is essentially a tale of love time and the pure love of friendship opposed 
 i own all family guy seasons so far and i have to say N has been the biggest of them all there are still plenty of to be found here but i think N like the last few volumes is slowly providing less and less at least for biggest i had with N is it seems to be very heavy in left politics i 'm a big in if you can at other people you should be able to at 
 this is a very strange film in many ways first many of the action really are n't that much fun the very first gun battle the occurs in the film was just silly not cool silly or even funny silly but just silly that 's not to say there are n't some great action scenes but most simply do n't come up to the level of some of the other films i have seen the opposite side is that this 
 showtime falls somewhere north of what some critics have been saying and a little south of what i expected months ago when i first heard about eddie murphy and robert di up for a comedy overall it was pretty good as real life crime or go and plot for that matter it is pretty but this is a comedy also while the special effects shots and up were present but lower key than a movie i found it a bit

 what an to who plays the film 's robin to have appear so large on the box art of the film and at least on recent to have only appear on the box considering that she was the star i realize that it is his name that will ultimately sell this after school special but at least give the woman some credit despite that this has to be one of the worst films that i have ever seen and it 
 this was one of the and shows that i have ever seen this is a must see for anyone over the age of this show had me and my N boys laughing out loud from the beginning i do n't know if everything on the show was true but the way it was presented left little doubt that was not only very knowledgeable but he also had a blast this information to the very lucky college kids who were in 
 a pretty obvious in which the only possible twist turns out to be a to nothing i was watching for the performance by it was n't great but then it was a strange role i would n't be surprised if half her contribution turned out to have been left on the floor along with several last minute script acting is the least appealing thing about this film steve looks like he 's trying to out his role with the that 
 this movie starts out with this song that gave me some like the song used in nightmare on it immediately sets the mood the that follows also shows what to expect we are made aware that a ghost is present the mystery concerning this ghost is what keeps this movie together but the structure of the plot is so complex that it is difficult to make sense of it the ideas behind the plot are quite interesting only the way 
 i enjoyed this film i thought it was an excellent political about something that 's never happened before a secret service agent going bad and involved in an assassination plot unfortunately for michael douglas ' character pete garrison they think he 's the but he is n't he 's just a agent having an affair with the first lady since he 's doing that he 's unable to give an acceptable and that makes him suspect number one when it 
 nothing better than an N 's technology and a to pull your thoughts from the of your mind front and center to be taken by a cast growing up in the N 's gave me the opportunity to see runs of not quite human on many special occasions considering the fact that my parents were never present during the i would guess that i would most likely not enjoy it near as much as i did as a child so 
 i am of the christopher generation it is fair to say that he was the best actor to play yet but that does n't stop me from enjoying other actors in the role and george makes a pretty good bid to knock chris off the top though he just barely falls short that does n't stop me from enjoying this film it has a lot going for it it has all that a movie needs a plot with beginning middle

 her look was totally inappropriate for the role her face remained too white hair too clothes etc too clean and especially her father 's old hat and in the scene where comes home for any sense of it would be one thing if the production had allowed all the other actors to remain clean and perfect too but she was the only one who did n't get there was never even a on her are we to believe she was

 there are some excellent comments and on this film i was pleased to note the comparisons to lang 's forget the N 's with david wayne the real is not the extraordinarily fine performance by taking out his frustrated anger on his victims mostly children he is the objective the real is the bureaucratic soviet system in its own the frustration of an dedicated man in his best role since the game a who 's willing to use the system 
 i watched this knowing almost nothing about it other than the brief i read here after watching it i was originally going to say that the director shows promise but seems kind of then i looked at the other stuff he 's done to see if this was his first or second movie but no he did house on hill and fear he sort of missed the mark on both those movies and it was the same with this story 
 predictable & poorly written i such a prominent cast would not be involved unless it had merit i guess competition actors is so intense these days and will only get worse that one can not pick and choose much any more early on we were given an who was was instrumental in the assassination and we had it down our ever since the movie lacked giving us little insight into the victim and only one possible motive for the murder

 this begins a series which i 'll hopefully keep up every of films that came out during my in this case it 's one i 've only managed to catch now it was clearly intended as the last word on the subject which basically had been to the level of over the years however in its for a approach a sure measure of which is that the is never once referred to by the name he 's been known all

 you the living ok i think i am an educated liberal and really into films i really like and have a great sense of i was under the impression this was a painful comedy they got paid for making this was used electricity food was consumed sets built why i blame the current state of the world on this film and all those people associated with it i will even include us the public we are all to blame and

 this is one of the worst movies ever there is a scene where they are supposed to be and they are literally walking on land and they added the is boring and is just this big slow computer generated silly thing antonio is horrible i mean even worse than normal how does this guy work the is the worst and there is nothing in the entire films i love movies and this one just i 've seen this studios movies 
 i really must watch a good movie soon because it seems every other entry or so is something that i however my history speaks i must not tell a lie bobby and everything about it big green i never thought that i would see a film as as this one did al is n't acting in this film he 's there are many many scenes of his character who is a race car driver just at the camera he 's 
 no way out N was a really bad and if it is the road to they choose the wrong & the boys & in my view this was the best match of the night some good here but not much championship open which won awful no high flying at all really quick and boring & little & the this was more comedy than some king a decent effort by these two but they could do better tag team championship paul 
 the film version of alice walker 's and influential N novel written largely as letters from the central character to god was a massive success and the role of the abused and goldberg gave her best screen performance by miles not far behind her was as the woman by fate others in the cast out the characters walker had introduced so clearly on the page danny as albert 's husband margaret avery as a force of change for the good 
 i just saw this on as one of the scary movies they show around halloween was this rated there was n't really anything to make this movie scary or worth watching also other people say this is a but i do n't think so for a you need something called humor this did n't have a of humor and it did n't make much sense either you basically have a looking monster man in rubber suit coming out of killing 
 much as i really like i once again why a good movie this version lacked the tension and passion of mostly it was a clear off was more convincing as a hurting child who with love i could n't believe owned this role unfortunately should have found another one that she could own she has other roles she does was good as a vulnerable but italian seemed in comparison this version was but love between mario and was perhaps predictable 
 if your going to make a about leonard cohen try making it about leonard cohen this is filled with only enough leonard to anger the who will be left wondering why they are listening to all these other some of them questionable talk about themselves sounds like them their in junior high who about you what about leonard guess what people if you do something worthy maybe someone will make a about you i found particularly the of 's members 
 this video is N besides the brain cell killing acting and plot it 's way too long do n't waste your money at the video store i actually was mad that i sat through this garbage and spent money on it just absolutely awful 
 unlike the of or big trouble in little china or the which are horrible films that have a certain and humor that turn them into the golden child is just plain itself is not and there are some funny moments but here the murphy attitude just any feeling of tension or danger in the story and the special effects are silly enough to do more damage to that tension the secrets of are rather than drawn upon to a feeling 
 boy oh boy does this movie this movie is one of the worst pieces of trash i have ever seen in my whole entire life please even if your life depends on it do not and i repeat do not under any circumstances view this piece of garbage only watch this thing when it comes on as a N episode that was the only way i could sit through the whole thing if i had to watch it without that 
 a and bit of bloody but badly with and wooden dialogue you do not care if the characters indeed even if the actors themselves live or die little grace or little action little point to the whole thing perhaps some of the set and setting will interest those between the boards of all the buildings may be true to the way life was lived the is unnecessary and and the character himself is both boring and 
 well its a great work by and some where people like this makes us believe that there is a lot more till now which has to be expressed and the film is a great media to do that well all great actors together hence nothing to say about acting or but the film gave us a great message through out it has predicted the of human minds with that of the patient we all believe that what we believe is

 this was the best movie i 've ever seen about it hit the exact spot of what is really about and how it 's not always about being and it showed how people with tend to think about things such as their outlook on life friends and themselves the best line and the part that really shows what the problem with is is when beth says it 's not about you that line really showed a lot about the character 
 ok please believe me when i say that this is a terrible terrible movie its done so poorly that much of the film plays out as and its absolutely a N waste of time awful but somehow also deeply i watched this as a double feature with N the massacre and although was an superior film that 's not saying much the plot of is so completely that its impossible to follow the is often seemingly endless and literally half 
 film in my opinion i was n't expecting it to be this good i was from start to it 's a very well made and educational film that really gives us a insight into the trials had to go through in order to convey his ideas to the world his life as he writes of the fighting both personal as well as the society of the time in order to do so he struggles hard with his mind body and

 would a different translation have made it or are the too compact to convey the of the original language does it even matter you may have heard that great actors can make reading a phone book exciting well this is an opportunity to judge for yourself if this is n't about murder psychology then it is about acting acting helped along with lots of so enjoy the acting or about how the actually english twelve angry men might be a 
 this is a disaster of a film from beginning to end it 's filled with bad acting and even worse direction and the only parts of the film are a few numbers by because the parts are impossible to watch or listen to the main problem of this film is that we never see 's character at his peak or 's character struggling the first should be seen in decline and the second rising the final number have one of 
 simply i just watched this movie just because of & am also giving these N stars just because of her on the other side this movie was easily one of the worst movies i have ever seen was horrible the script was this was a movie that kept itself the film was sloppy and its not like i was expecting a good film just something to give me a jump or two this did not even do worst thing is 
 i saw this on television more years ago than i can remember but never the performance of davis jr. i just by chance thought to look for it on video this of and is a i would love to see it again and introduce my son to it as well i just ca n't imagine why it is not as one of the greatest performances davis jr. every gave whoever is responsible for not bringing this to audiences should be 
 i have seen this movie N times in N months and i never get tired of it just because it is perfect and it has also got the best film music ever and the best supporting roles ever written for a movie i mean you just have to love robert martin and in this movie but specially i can not believe that vs. did win an in of this amazing war movie so this is my conclusion if you take 
 i really wish i had read everyone 's review before going to see the movie it was one of the most films that i 've ever seen i was ready to leave the theater N minutes into the movie i should have followed my the movie offered nothing new or it was boring and very i was surprised to find that it was directed by a woman the characters did not represent any women that i know they were boring 
 is ray moore 's with horrible action is about as close as you can get to becoming a of a without actually being citizen kane this may not be nor but this is undoubtedly in it 's own right the production values in this movie are so bad they could qualify as special effects the plot a little in the middle but the power of such a cheap as is enough to bring all but the film through the ever

 i am in of the number of people who consider this film to be decent much less great do the majority of people even have basic standards for a film they watch i just do n't know commercial product does n't really deserve the respect of being called a film to call dean is a gross to anyone who actually has talent i have had a lot of respect for but most of that has gone right down the at 
 i just watched that movie and was pretty disappointed i did n't expect much to begin with as the of the movie does n't suggest anyway it does n't even manage to deliver just as stupid entertainment the main problem is probably the acting while i 've seen far worse actors in far worse movies the story would require some people to act out as violent some others as people caught a in really stressing and they fail to deliver 
 terrible direction from an awful script even the looked and out of focus all over the unlike most of the other i had no idea this was about boys in love in the but that fact became immediately obvious from the opening scene and all the shots of or young men usually or with sweat looking at each other 
 this movie starts off somewhat slowly and gets running the end not that that is bad it was done to illustrate character of the main character consequently if you are not into this is not your movie it is the thought philosophy of this movie that makes it if you liked 's and punishment you will probably like this if only for the comparisons the intriguing question that the movie is what is it that makes a writer completely his 
 while channel we found this movie with its promising we were at the flat acting and we found amusing the car scenes shoot and sets that crash down with the weight of and what was even more was seeing all the recycled scenes from 's peak where the church front falls on the school bus the store fronts break away from the main street the and the red truck speeding down the alley way as the bricks fall down on

 this is the first review i 've wrote for so with me but i caught this on hbo and was sure glad i watched it richard is great in this film as the who the rules to get the job done i think the story is great and there 's never a scene that the pace of the movie down some parts of the movie which have to do with sex are pretty but if you 've ever seen a

 the book is so good that at least the opening of this movie will move you but then as it more and more from the book taking out all the and love and and putting in cotton candy it becomes boring still from comments i 've heard people who have not read the book tend to like it and if it leads even on child to read a in time it will have served its purpose the most embarrassing change 
 this movie was the and most boring so called that i have ever seen i would include a comment on the plot but there was none i do not recommend this movie unless you are prepared for the biggest waste of money and time of your life

 the absurd idea of having the killer on the at an island resort where there is no snow or cold weather brings back the spirit of the returning thanks to a scientific experiment providing foreign elements which life to his it 's the best i could do to explain this concept could go into about how he up at the island in order to numerous tourists but i simply find no reason to bother because it 'd all be so 
 from reading the back of the box my first thought was that this is probably a knock off of saw i could n't be further from the truth it seemed to me like they gave somebody with a camera phone and $ and told them to make a movie the plot did n't exist and neither did the acting it was almost as if i was watching a silent film about growing it did n't surprise me at all to 
 i loved this series when it was on kids i did n't believe that there was a batman spin off seeing as the original show ended in N and this show came in first of all i loved the idea of robin leaving batman to solve crime on his own it was an interesting perspective to their relationship i also liked the addition of tim in the series and once again like it 's predecessor this show had great story 
 is the one show which the interest in science in is so much more then plain and simple comedy drama and much more the acting is very good survived also it 's cancellation and showed with wars that it is not dead yet i hope there is a future for in my opinion it is also not that some of the characters in the show are you have to look behind that and you will see what a beauty set

 i this movie on without knowing what to expect and as i am about to study in canada of all places i most certainly will bring this up in story centered around the probably most film team in the history of film itself is written and the very actors manage to deliver every single on you simply could n't during hollywood north i suggest seeing a right away you might have serious the wonderful script i also noticed the great 
 the film is about a young man michael who for the elderly one day he decides to kill some of the of his clients around the same time he decides to model his killing after the killer of the N 's he gets in touch with the author of a book about the killer and they form a friendship michael has a gun the only gun as it seems to be in the hands of some of the other actors 
 from the view of a like i am the movie is interesting you can see many race cars from even tough the racing scenes are not that much realistic but i have to admit that i have n't seen any race before N because before that time they did n't show any races in germany from the view of a burt reynolds fan like i am the movie basically is what we are used to see from reynolds in the 
 andy is a master of the first order the way through his art indeed time and change is what his work is fundamentally about i bought his first book several years ago and my family has at it many times so it was a treat to get to know the artist personally through this film he is just as patient and as you would expect and has some wonderful things to say about the natural world the of which are 
 how the hell did they get this made itself as a comedy the $ is essentially two hours of people sentence the usually warren looks drunk and the usually acts like she 's on as for his most famous role was more than his character here not even the guy with the champagne bottle of can save this of i this movie to plan N from outer space i would n't do such a thing even if someone paid me 
 for me this wonderful of a film bears repeated its about the lives of three very different people hunter is the producer albert plays the but brilliant journalist william hurt is the but new kid on the block news classical love emerges with the and in love with hunter but she of course is attracted to film works on many levels at the very least it is a brilliant comedy with the one flying so thick and fast that each 
 good actors and good performances ca n't a script bad dialogue and patterns of behavior into nothing you 'd care about the most interesting character is david no character development no growth no interest just some suffering for no particular reason teaching us nothing and not even to 
 i 'm sorry to all the fans but this is a movie the acting is bad even wooden it the early on and does n't exactly work i think there was supposed to be a twist at the end but it just ended up being confusing what the hell the who was killing everyone was one of the try hardly original and it is n't even particularly good as a straight and that 's saying think whoever did the whoever 
 i was surprised to catch this on tv friday and i enjoyed it between the presence of phillips and the numerous to everything that could be considered this was a fun movie to watch i enjoyed the story which reminded me of a book i 've read earth david and was fun to see on tv looks great but i also enjoyed her performance as because she did seem different from everyone else but the greatest thing about this movie 
 ok let 's get this clear i 'm really not into but for some reason i love jack takes his team through a a round device that creates a it gives you the ability to travel to distant it might sound like your usual but it 's not the plot is set today not in some distant like many other i find that great it gives you things and such you can to and you can jump into the series 
 i saw this move several years ago at the central florida film festival if i recall i liked it it showed great potential i guess most people here are this film because the film did seem together by the 's own admission on the official site the short was as a nonetheless it was an comedy i think many people try to read far too much into a comedy all they are supposed to do is make you that 's 
 where can i begin i heard this movie was coming out and i was very mad i am a huge fan of the original 's way and when i heard about this i thought it would be just like almost all the other that come out in hollywood i thought it would be bad boy was i wrong this movie was much worse than i expected not saying all are bad but the problem with hollywood these days they make

 this film is wonderful in every way that modern action are not take some time relax enjoy think people who see this movie as slow or or really need to take a week off and watch it several times until their short attention span mind comes to with the possibility of being involved with a cause or even beautiful story in a beautiful place for no other reason than because it is n't to make the points you so need 
 although it has been N years i still remember the complete waste that the entire plot of the movie unfortunately i came across this movie after my friends and i selected it while through the new releases at blockbuster we decided to pick the movie because it was the only one we all had not seen and it sounded like it may be although it has been quite some time since i viewed the movie i still remember the lack

 good good acting good direction can not justify a story that is not and can not be acceptable to any society has often used the media to make this junk sell able by saying that if such an incident happens then what i would like to ask him if such a thing happens for your own child or your say girl child then what will you do i think every parents will have to take special care before with any 
 i gave this movie such a high mark because it was really really funny all while being i went to see this film when it was playing in the area and it was the centerpiece of a great night out with friends the film is well written and well acted and though it does feel a bit like a rather then a movie that does n't take away from the film you just do n't find like this anymore where 
 stephen plays the role of a who gets talked into driving an car for a bank hold up and drives into everything that comes across his path however the police seem to appear on the scene very quickly and a who gave the police advanced notice the story gets into many and turns and the money from the hold up has disappeared and nobody knows its new owner poor gets a bit into this hold up and naturally he is

 this movie has been done when and who is as well in the movie was at the top and many politics and even the roman church used to close eyes about and evil of especially in usa there were many people who had not understood what was really going on in germany and europe charles for example would be as today a big actor would made a of or maybe made a lot of mistakes in his life but this 
 i made the mistake of buying this since i collect comic book inspired movies even at N $ it was too expensive i thought there might be some fun in it a so bad it becomes good perhaps i was wrong i had watched it once long ago and did n't remember any of it now i know why i was out of my mind and was looking for to do something else i 'm all for power attitude and 
 everyone knows that late night movies are n't fine i mean i 'll admit that i was a bit and and figured i 'd get to some it 's pretty bad when the on the tv guide channel makes fun of the movie in the it even gave it half a star to be fair i did sit throw the whole thing cause man it was bad i could n't stop laughing i mean the words coming out of these 
 the movie is great and i like the story i prefer this movie than other movie such the cell sick movie and silly movie i just tell the truth i like a reality and also a true story 
 before i go on i have to admit to being a huge fan in fact what attracted me to the case in the first place i probably would have bought it anyway being such a big fan and having enjoyed the first title so this is n't half as good not even jon could save this film for me my main problem would be that it simply is n't scary apart from jon 's character none of the other characters 
 i saw this film at the film the year it won best short film i have to say that i thought the direction was and the performances from the key cast members were very both of the main cast are definitely names to watch out final shot over the was and i for one would like to find myself there if i was waiting for the end of the world to happen the was definitely a great done with great

 absolutely in this episode which is the only vehicle i 've seen the end of the career that allowed him to do the physical and silent comedy that made him famous it 's still a shock to hear his voice in the his voice is about the only thing i do n't care for as far as is concerned but his ability to take a is still he even some of the used in his early with to rod for

 i got on this as apparently abc has licensed this show to tv in hong kong it caught be my surprise as it was a break from listening to anything chinese but i started getting in as the cast and the story lines are just enough and nothing too though i think it 's very very of them to write as a potential black man with a sheet that has been the most disappointing aspect the rest is great and

 i love so what i 'm about to me deeply i had given a down to parts N and N without having seen the film terrible i know but i felt into a trap by who i do n't really know but there has been a negative word of mouth that spread like wild fire and no matter how smart i think i am i fell into it but i into an film director martin a man i love and 
 i went to see the movie not because of the actors not because of the plot but because it was rated N here in and a movie has to be really or to be put in this category believe me being a i have seen quite a lot of films in my lifetime the killer but this movie was by far the most disturbing and picture i have ever seen the plot is plain stupid the is awful acting was 
 i believe this film was made for the not so sum of but that did n't really show there was n't anything about the production or the acting the characters were and real and the location could have been any desert area in the world instead of a not too warm beach just north of the actors were quite easily acceptable as a bunch of on a and planet none of them seemed to be particularly friendly with but were 
 hong kong directors crossing over to hollywood to make movies is nothing new with the temporary exodus of the likes of john woo in the from their collective output only a few movies or may i say just one made an impact at the box office the andrew and alan partnership has been a tour de force in recent history especially with their now famous affairs which was into martin 's the so it 's no surprise when hollywood comes 
 just imagine the real who was a master of propaganda and speech would have been such a as portrayed him in this would have followed him not even a desperate guy in the is just a hollywood piece of propaganda itself as true history everyone who actually believed anything from this show and the producers did n't get anything right with was able to win so many people a whole county for his ideas if we was such a why 
 it really my mind when someone comes across a movie like this and claims it to be one of the worst films out there this is by far not one of the worst out there still not a good movie but not the worst nonetheless go see something like death or blood lake and then come back to me and tell me if you think the night brings charlie is the worst the film has decent camera work and which 
 obviously inspired by and sometimes even more more and very details a bit too much for my taste great script and acting i was especially impressed by ken and there were no weak points in cast good and very realistic one of the best i 've seen since years although it was scheduled on in three parts i watched messiah on video in one take one point of critic the of the was not very convincing

 this is a joke right this ca n't be a real film it 's not even a real video give any milk high school kid a video and they could make a better movie than this the film maker 's ca n't be serious right is this comedy drama gone wrong the script is about as and as is ten locked in a room with a laptop could come up with a better the dialogue is n't dialogue might this 
 is a new film that without a doubt will please many fans simply because it 's so down to the point and unscrupulous it has many genuine a whole lot of and a rare tension what it has n't got is logic and a solid plot but to tell you the truth that did n't bother me for one second when the start to roll there are still many questions to on but christopher smith in his debut preferred to 
 this movie is amazing because the fact that the real people themselves and their real life experience and do such a good job it 's like they 're almost living the past over again plays himself an actor who quit everything except music and drugs struggling with depression and searching for the meaning of life while being angry at everyone especially the people who care for him most there 's moments in the movie that will make you cry because 
 i can understand why some people like this movie and why some people do n't for me though i really like it even if i noticed some good and not so impressive the was actually excellent like charlie 's dream the characters were a mixed bag the best being voiced by the late i was ill when i read what happened to her also is a very convincing especially voiced by the wonderful i particularly loved i 'm surrounded by

 there are lots of other comments here about how poor this film is what i wanted to point out is how this film took the largest science project in history and made it look small the manhattan project was an incredible achievement and it was huge virtually all silver in the country went into making wire for if there was every a choice between two alternative ways of doing things they just did both the first sustained nuclear was fired 
 i just caught an episode about the crack cocaine who turned to a drug life on the streets after his bicycle racing career went to as fast as it started i have to say that the story about his career was more than his drug here 's this young guy who is winning bike races left and right and is invited to train with an olympic training team for two weeks and immediately upon he armstrong one of the greatest 
 the title of this is very misleading at no time during the do they show how the introduction of the fish into lake has cause any of the problems facing the town of the film tries to place the problems of on an environmental cause but the truth of that matter is the problems stem from a outside force the is very slowing with no what so ever instead it relies on small of text between none related segments to 
 amazing effects for a movie of this time a of the of war and how war becomes a of wonderful thing about this movie is it is now public and available at no charge no sign up necessary watch it in one sitting and you will be plan to share this with as many people as possible as i had never heard of it before and i am a hard core sci would like to see how others react to

 series N has got off to a great start i do n't think you need to have watched series N to get a grasp of happening but like any series its nice to feel some sense of the characters and to care about what happens to them and this show makes you think like that these N women seem to lead glamorous and exciting lives yet the is and realistic so the and turns that arrive thanks to their love 
 i just finished watching guinea experiment i have to say that this movie although having very good better then i expected was not a good movie i say that i enjoyed this movie at all of course it is effective in its way of being a realistic N minutes of but i found it to be very boring and not as as i hoped and also i found that the were very when they talked and trying to sound tough 
 i must say i was disappointed with this film although it is well acted and directed the underlying story simply along too in another mood i would have liked it better i did a lot but rarely out loud and there was actually a sense of to discover who won but in contrast to another movie that my wife picked up the same day one neither of us had heard of before this one in you see lots of movies 
 i too saw this film at a film festival but unlike the previous i found it both interesting and original in a sea of terrible features are often twice as bad do to small budgets and poor acting however is a little that back to the outer limits the performances are solid not that one would expect otherwise from or and the is sharp and on the money i personally find it difficult to the previous 's comments with the 
 i first saw this film about N years ago and i have been by it ever since it is such a experience that i could watch it at any time of the year however to me it is the ultimate christmas fact that it is in b & is irrelevant although i often wonder what it would be like in you can just get that warm feeling watching the christmas events and morgan are perfect together and is the of 
 i 've been going through the 's list of the top N and i must say that this is truly one of the worst not just of the N movies on the list i 've seen but of any movie i 've ever seen are funny sometimes is n't almost made it but just go watch arrested development if you want to see her in something good seriously laughing and drinking is supposed to be funny i would highly recommend 
 the only reason i knew of midnight was because it was in the critic 's top for a top N it is not a very well known movie indeed i had to look hard to find a copy i got the version for about surprisingly it was only rated the version doubt many will take notice of this review more like comment so i 'll make it is perhaps one of the movies i 've seen partly because of the 
 i 'd picked this one up time and time again in the rental store wondering if i should give it a shot today i broke down and gave it a and i probably should n't the did give the film a respectable effort it fell far short of engaging the characters while you wanted to feel for them just did n't have enough development or for you to get truly involved with them 's sexual got fast i do n't 
 this is the worst movie i have ever seen if i was n't watching it for free i would have never finished it the of this film should be of themselves it seems like this is supposed to be a film in the of scary movie and date movie a terrible movie but better than this one but failed the only jokes in this movie seem to be based on a guy falls down someone gets hit by a bus 
 it 's but then what else did you expect the is 's younger sister complete with mother sister and the hero if you can call him that is an and the rival love interests are full of cast and were all very attractive and i thought the actors did a job considering how weak the material was the movie was and a that was carefully to the about what he should be experiencing throughout mcdonough sang and provided the film 
 well to start with i 'm straight up as black as black gets and i can tell you it 's very sad when black people think a black movie i ca n't say i 've ever seen a movie this badly directed or a worse story is my and all but he was n't feeling this movie at all i do n't know how much they paid him to be in this of called a movie but i hope it 
 it 's to view this film as a experiment i like to think that the director was trying to see if it was possible to take all the of comedy film and produce something that was completely utterly entirely answer to judge by from is a ' this may not be the worst film i 've ever seen but my brain seems to have all memory of the others this horrible just on the bad enough that the thought still 
 i was n't at all a fan of the N hit and most of these are just as bad or worse yet live feed managed to keep me somewhat for about the first N minutes started off with plenty of sex and followed by some good death scenes involving the chinese organized crime and a butcher what put me out of the movie was the tough ' with the guns and a saving the day i would call this movie 
 well i set out with a few friends to see this movie we went an hour before the show started to get good seats so as you can probably imagine we where to see this movie but that excitement soon turned to this movie is a complete failure it just try 's to hard to be funny that its sad the script is poorly written and relies to heavy on the actors to make up for it the only good 
 ' is a movie worthy of anyone 's time it is a intense film and kept my attention the entire time john is absolutely stunning in his portrayal of a tender and watson is as the but daughter of a highly respected russian family the chemistry between watson and on screen is obvious from the moment their characters meet in the story all in all this movie is one of the best looks at the life of a and and 
 i am N years old and i am writing this review in my mom 's sign in she will write her own review later this is my all time favorite was in england in i watched it so many times when i was little that i wore out the video tape i love this movie and it changed my life the beautiful the mighty thoroughbred horse the plain little irish village with the young girl who wanted to do what 
 i know that 's taken on its surface this is a bad perhaps in a league with plan N from outer space the is suspect but the is quite the plot is not quite 's character while watching the movie happen that truly make you wonder and kim making out on a tank eating a in a just about everything says and does these things taken separately are perhaps flaws taken together however they are merely watching this movie with 
 strange i like all this movie crew and dark humor movies but did n't like this one at all it 's awful horrible and surely not funny at all can not do a whole movie plot either and it was really boring long empty moments the movie it could have been removed it should have been in another shorter format surely maybe i expected too much from the crew like saving the movie it 's also filled with of characters 
 it is a sick and tale of and story is and constructed it is really a perfect it has all from to humor and the story is told with lots of the film is built up like a which is assembled piece by piece and the story for the there are plenty of surprises till the end i also had a little impression that the director has been inspired by some work i 've also seen films before where you 
 for this movie based off of a tv show and a serious i thought that it was a way to end off a serious 'm a s and ' was pretty good but not this one unless you really love the series like myself this was a loyal fan of the show even stevens but the plot was too and dave man that guy has n't done anything good well ever they should n't have used tim he 's a 
 i like movies a lot i like the really good ones such as the day the earth stood still when of the body and many others and sometimes the really bad ones because they can be really funny and great to watch with friends such as plan N from outer space however when a movie is bad but not bad enough to be fun it really should be avoided this movie is just such a film the make it appear 
 piece of junk would 've given it a N if i could have is good but not quite good enough is absolutely the most ridiculous i 've ever come across and that 's saying a lot this ' tried so hard to be interesting but failed it 's almost as if the writer started one story then got another idea and attempted to the two together do n't waste your time on this believe me you 'll be as off 
 the incredible man is a gross and energetic production that every simply has to see for the ideal way to describe this N 's is like a copy of 's the only a thousand times steve west is the only of a but turns out the carrier of a horrible disease that makes him and causes him to in shock after seeing his face in the mirror can you blame him steve out of the hospital leaving a trail of 
 de 's only reason for existence is it 's local popularity it has caused this to run for over N years and still counting deals about an team with the emphasis every deals with the same subject some that takes ridiculous and predictable to get resolved in the show 's been running for over N years now and the production probably decided not to change a winning team which means that the show has had minor changes over the course 
 every now and then a movie itself as scary or though they usually are n't most modern movies fit into this there are those movies that do n't simply cause the tension and to pump through your harder than usual they actually you to a level that you 've never experienced halloween is such a film it takes so many risks that would make most movie producers but nearly all of them work halloween is in its and as a 
 the plot of this movie around this who 's a real and he wants to launch his new that can travel thousands of feet deep unfortunately he ca n't oh and he 's by the memories of his mom and getting by a when he was a child the guy meets some scientist pretty hot and they and this crew of about a hundred people set out on the main character 's to kill the same that killed his the 
 if you love japanese monster movies you 'll love this action packed battle an intent upon the earth and a giant robot with an of the from the planet has a army of called of course the gang as well as an endless supply of hostile creatures that are routinely upon the earth to buildings make loud panic the etc a little kid named has the giant robot at his call and sends the robot as needed to beat up 
 i was lucky enough to see this at this years film festival i was stunned by how well made and how entertaining this wonderful little film was director has done a great job this film that has several characters and several story lines that so smoothly and the main story involves the family and it is very and entertaining story that involved the in every scene the film as a whole has credibility and integrity yet still has that commercial 
 this was usually producer alexander 's advice on set to many of his the film is credited with three directors but in truth alex and william helped out pushing it to john 's N book the top N movies his survey of N film critics saw the thief of reach place a closer examination reveals only jose luis john russell taylor and himself actually voted for the picture but their high were enough to take it to near the of 
 there are lot of between never say never again and not only on but also the story and plot except the actors all other are same like asking for trafficking in a ship etc only difference are place of in ball plot it is in in never say never again it is over north africa and in ball the nato itself the into plane and in never say never again it is changed by an rouge arm of the and 
 watching than director marc 's the is the equivalent of eating your because this rated is good for your diet no this is n't the kind of movie that i like to on the and at the end of a tough day the is n't your typical mainstream movie designed to you and make you forget about your troubles first no celebrity stars appear in it second nothing is cut and black or white or so that you do n't 
 this movie is absurd absolutely terrible michael and andy garcia must really have needed the work to do this movie the plot is totally not michael agrees to bone to the dying son of a but then he manages to the police throughout the hospital not that he would have so much knowledge of the hospital he takes an extremely route to get out of the hospital up the power and a bridge why and to top that andy garcia 
 to this day when you speak of the japanese most folks wo n't talk about or the seven or ran to the the japanese means all those we 've grown to love destroying those japanese cities over and over again lots of times in with each other the first and greatest of these is who 's come back a dozen times or more and in a few films faced the three headed like monster from outer space enough in keeping 
 too often screen of compromise but this is one of those rare occasions when every perfect in itself comes together and perfectly midler was born to play this role and her performance will most likely be remembered as definitive she is supported by an ideal cast and the direction and design are tops it does n't get any better than this 
 intended as light entertainment this film is indeed successful as such during its first half but then to a rapidly script that drops it down harry nelson a and an actress are employed as live window at a department store where one evening they are late in leaving and are locked within they witness from their less than glass point an apparent on the street the miles raymond mancuso a local returns the following day to the since he that 
 this movie is about a depressed and man has a distant relative move in with him in his apartment in as time passes their relationship becomes more and more until finally he begins at his house guest who is out of work and does n't appear all that eager to find work that 's most of the movie in fact the problem is that although and depressed people are very withdrawn and they do n't make for a very satisfying 
 i have N words for you he is the only presence in this film but even so do n't see this movie even though he is good as the main you do n't want to waste your time i did n't care about the characters except the little boy and in fact i did n't really care if the star crossed ended up together or died the movie did not make me care or believe that these people about each 
 this film is a of a theme we 've all seen over and over again the in space the characters are all stock characters etc etc the only question really is who 's next to it sometimes this tried and tested formula works like in this case but more often not like the truly red planet so why does this one work because it 's the acting is above average and above all it is n't predictable the conclusion is 
 very done movie it does stay in your memory better billed as a than flying or war the flying parts are realistic and almost error free flying like myself will enjoy this movie even if attracted by the airplanes unless they have no or have never been in watching early he is good and his reading of high flight is boom 
 the color of leon is quite remarkable here including his use of filters scenes the alfred score has to be the most and score hollywood ever produced it 's a shame it is no longer available on cd the actors however never rise to the occasion the are so from the subdued british of and to the hollywood of and mature that it seems a true with no central vision is american acting styles span the range from to only 
 i wanted to see this movie ever since the came out i do n't understand why everyone is so hard on this film it may not all be technically true to the sport of but this film is not mainly about the sport it 's about a team that is taught how to be more than the world expects of them they are taught to become men and not boys hollywood is never N correct in their productions they are 
 this film is a brilliant of shakespeare 's classic love story complete with sex body and it does follow the same spirit as all the other movies except combat shock that was but it 's not only for fans anybody who and a script will without a doubt fall in love with this n't expect like the version of r & with and leo this one knows its a silly movie and draws its humor from that the acting is 
 i viewed my last night for the first time in at least ten years i found the work itself and the performances just as as they were in my memory george of course was the master of the role of there is never a touch of softness in his determination to on those he believes caused his wife 's death and his daughter 's disappearance at least not until the end when he that his for has led him to 
 brothers with powers yes really not just for 's but really over a secret from their that left them at odds over their are the fire that act like a chorus but there is also and the is great similar to the way american in london used every great wolf song they could get but with fire and i do n't think i 'll ever forget dennis dennis setting his own a ' to 's a lady ' best line 
 post murder did some good roles in films but other director just made use of his and is one of them and it came after in a row and i was already fed up of him and such roles the film has a nice twist at the start i felt like an film but then it turns into a routine film with sudden love sudden and a bad makes a terrible film music is saving grace is just his act 
 excellent story of lives that need repair one of those rare films that i could watch with my N and N year old daughters glenn close was excellent in the title role it was also nice to see christopher in a more normal role 
 sometimes when a film is by the critics one just has to see it to see if it is really as bad as the claim well in this case it was i believe it was meant to be a sex comedy but it was neither nor funny i think i once when vegas failed to vault a and that was film follows the lives of four men who deliver potatoes for a living each of them has a problem with 
 norman wisdom 's final vehicle was a departure from his previous bringing his this being a product of the the end result is an uneasy and occasionally embarrassing comedy which the star 's typical and with mild and even the plot has to do with an executive on a trip for a banking conference falling for who does n't mind getting involved with him but does n't take their relationship all that seriously either appears as 's friend who warns 
 know when one looks at this brian film today i 'm sure there has been of criticism about how dated it is also about the violence when i looked at this film on when i was N i thought it was and as well but i did n't get few decades go by and man how i know how much i did n't get in this film this is a of an excellent film which was done back in the 
 if you are a christian or a hoping to see an accurate or portrayal of the events in exodus you will be disappointed by this movie in typical hollywood fashion people who are not even in the have been created for supporting characters and play a large role in the movie 's role is changed completely and he becomes nothing but an instead of a who gave excellent advise god is largely removed from the movie and instead viewers are 
 as a father of four in his i thought this film made compelling if not stuff i deserves a far higher rating than the that it had when i wrote this i gave it i agree with some of the comments about the characters but was again in yet another very different role the plot was a little silly but the point of the film for me was up in the final quite a moving ending for any could imagine 
 prior to this release neil had this to say about the N original it 's surprising how many people say it 's their favorite i 'm like come on you may not like the new one but if that 's your favorite i do n't know if i want you to like my film neil a word you might want to sit down for this too as lord says shocks are so much better absorbed with the see neil the 
 hollywood that expects nothing but and from its audience the scenes without reveal how truly awful the film really is but the scenes with are just so entertaining that you hang on in there right to the end yes he could play this part in his sleep but he does it so well he 's such a to watch so and enjoy it for his performance but do n't expect anything else from this movie if you want to see 
 what was steven thinking i mean i love i love all his movies up to the his early stuff is some of the best in the this however does not live up to its excellent name attack force with marshall lawson would be expected to be a action movie with in typical form however what we get is a crime mystery on a political with little or no action is always in because of his weight i could not follow 
 as usual on going by the majority vote instead of the weighted average is far more of the movie 's entertainment value in this case the majority gives it a one how right they are to start my review i 'll first admit that i am completely as to why this movie is titled it does involve space and even an i but there 's no or reason at all for anything in the long run at least no actual 
 if you 're ufo facts then this video is very important the ' of the video is the comments made by he is without a doubt from the best of america trained to be objective honest and in his reports many from america of all have reported some kind of contact or ufo and there are from some of those at the very least something has happened that requires further objective ongoing investigating i think this testimony from shows that 
 this was the best and movie i have seen it has more accurate accounts of what happened and while it their crimes it the pair in a normal light i give this movie a it has great actors realistic scenes and excellent writers 
 i liked house of much more than house of is much more & his acting is n't as ridiculous & as in the actors deliver solid enough performances the the monster the village the village the etc are mixed in well so that none becomes an odd as in better run than the the is as as the in the doctor is very good as well adds a touch with his worth watching twice a classic universal with that typical 
 there is an inherent problem with commenting or reviewing a film such as this i remember feeling the same way after if you do not like a film that is odd and controversial like dr. you are seen as not getting it of course for those who have already seen this film you know that the entire point is not getting it have heard from several different sources that the unique and aspect of this film is a quality it 
 i had watched and recorded this a few years back on local tv and having been by it i subsequently erased the tape however when it was released by mgm as part of a movie of films for a very affordable price i could n't resist giving it a second look this has since gone actually i received the a few months ago but only now with 's passing did i get to it this time around i was more 
 victor never became a major star he is better known for later character roles than for his early leads but he was very and an excellent love scenes with young in this romantic are their look very real and very is a here also she plays a woman with a reputation but the character has a good print i saw was not clear but what a that rare movies like this are turning up and they are in some sort 
 this is a way cool fantasy movie one of my it really is so cool the director is bernard rose who went on to direct he made a great start with this film about a girl called who falls ill with fever on her birthday she draws a house on a of paper from her exercise book and falls into a dream in which the house is real each subsequent dream that she has is altered by the presence of 
 this move is terrible they took word and made a of it the acting was terrible too why bother doing a story on something from the when your not even going to tell it there were not just a few changes but the whole thing was wrong do not see this movie 
 we open with van the original universal and his asian friend being down a river by what appear to be universal soldiers they almost kill the two then oh wait it was just a field test we come to find is now part of a government funded company that designs the new level of universal soldiers why he would want to be involved in this if you know anything about the original is never explained and well beyond 's after 
 this is the most and i 've ever seen oh where to start plot what little there is jr. a young billionaire with a bad heart is desperately in need of a transplant has been engaged to his mother 's pa played by on the night that these two get married it just so happens that a heart with the same rare blood type is found go and figure the odds of that one once on the operating table finds 
 just got back from a free and i 'm very glad i did n't pay to see this very film the theater was full and the crowd was a mix of kids and adults it seemed like it was just the kids who were laughing at all the and jokes though good god they loved to hit these poor mice in the a lot the movie is pretty predictable and mostly the characters just seem to be thrown together to 
 i 'm a big fan of the old and do not believe that hollywood is capable of its old glory but not even fleming and stewart can help this N movie which carries nearly all the of of the turned good guy fallen but woman who must turn to for etc i ca n't help but notice the last names of the writer and young actor who plays 's son any there i 've seen better acting in high school 
 given the budget and the of everyone involved ' life could have been worse wants to be chris tucker whom i 've always found very as a previous has noted but edward d. smith while some of his over reactions go on way too long a director 's problem has some and funny moments such as when he is trying to on the proper method of smoking a joint with a buddy throughout he is usually more poised and than 
 i think charlotte is one of the best performers in the world i ca n't understand why some people say she 's not boring maybe the one who said she 's boring is because is boring she 's a great actress and the movie was excellent it has lots of wonderful ideas and very good performers the direction was great i myself in the french environment with all the and flowers problems etc when she goes to the sister 's 
 the historical of this film have been well it was never intended to be serious history but an entertaining and there it succeeds was never better as this role was tailored for him was never more beautiful arthur kennedy never more anthony never more noble than as crazy horse it had much humor and and held your interest throughout the one historical aspect i found most inaccurate was the final last stand which occurred on the banks of the little 
 i remember this film exhibit in spain in N for the time of a week although it could seems incredible and i ca n't offer any explanation for it this movie was exhibit in a theater dedicated to movies of art and big quality that is and the projected man few people saw it people no doubt and no reference about this very boring movie can be found in the peter science or about the author of the original novel 
 when i sat down to watch this film i actually expected quite a bit as the plot takes on quite complex issues using football as launching for the also was an interesting approach still unfortunately despite its of dealing with controversial issues as culture between and western culture adding generation conflicts and it lets you down the resolution with a rather relief to all the built up throughout the film this leads me to the impression that the makers took 
 there are so many incorrect statements in this so-called that i found myself shouting at the might be able to produce a flashy looking but he is lacking at looking at the science behind his relies on either being inaccurate not telling the full story or the old government always lies to us and people what is told to them and not checking on the or details behind the 's more his exclusive or is freely available over the from 
 if you want to see someone eat another man 's or look at a row of fake at a or listen to a man talk about how good it felt to have sex with a girl while she was throwing up then this is the movie for you in neck breaking fashion between romantic and gross out comedy is certainly interesting the lovely plays the wife of tell me another one who is found in many situations with other women 
 after the success of part N another was a natural move however they should have stopped it before it began alice having survived part N finds herself pregnant and it seems is using her child to get at his victims which of course are alice 's friends strange nightmare movie very heavy on and bad acting the special effects are good but the movie itself is not 
 the man is a show everybody s got love it me of the old school N 's series the special effects are small but very effective but what is most important is the fun they had shooting this series it really shows the entire cast fit perfect in there roles and it looks like they can do whatever they want especially paul ben victor and vincent really in this one for me its that an actor with so much is 
 is a film of it has an exceptionally well cast with being the a production and possibly with at the helm a of rural southern india through the eyes of a N year old a remarkable of song and dance traditional and modern perfectly and a beautiful backdrop of color of the and that make up the experience what a achievement for a debut director the casting was absolutely i wish india would come out with more of such films 
 let me break down this film for you the first minutes are a for terrible special effects i 'm not one to about special effects but what you 've got to understand is that if you ca n't afford good special effects you should n't your film around special effects fire of color at each other into stock explosions and past with counts low enough to count with your fingers you will have no idea what is happening it will 
 i 'm sorry but this really does feel like a modern day N totally at least felt like a comic book this felt like a bad high school film project acting was about as as one can get and landing a space shuttle on an la freeway come on seriously jerry what were you thinking and all the the pregnant 's wife the reporter who gets in everyone 's way the manager with go fever and it 's one thing 
 seems that the cast should ensure at least an average movie and so i sat down for N minutes of ed harris seems to own the skills of acting even who i normally must have had an during the entire of just case not once in during the whole movie one actor could convince made this movie look cheap and story makes up a little it is and the plot is only watch this movie if you really have nothing 
 of the living dead is about a young scientist named rick who lives with his brother in the town of oklahoma where drug dealers and fill the streets then one night rick 's brother gets shot by a gang driving down the street who fought with him earlier desperate rick calls his scientist partner to bring over the latest formula they 've been working on that brings sick blood cells to health the formula has n't been tested on a 
 among the many here for this production there was one individual whose comments asked if were the only one who was n't that by it giving this film N stars however the comment went on to indicate an overall of the story and other production of same well this person is n't the only one who did n't like this production include me but there i part company even with if you put a gun to my head and asked 
 i registered with just so i could comment about this movie my god what a pile of horse this was it should n't even be touted as a real movie this is very this is a N year old 's film project at best the acting is terrible but even good actors could not save this the is probably the worst part of this movie who the hell wrote this and that constant joke coming from the about being a 
 is a fantasy of a girl or perhaps her of what her youth was like growing a performance as an russian scientist who can not find decent work in america he an isolated while performing duties of a at a science chief doctor is a bitter man as who can speak and fully language and learn the doctor who later him to the lower levels of the building where tony s. finds his life with and how they lost each 
 i thought this move was very good there were a few things that were less than perfect but overall i was quite surprised the courtroom scene in the end seemed a little but was real enough to be entertaining i found that the movie the of going though military training and the that go along with it being a military pilot i could to many of these parts 
 absolutely mexican film supposedly based on a short story by edgar about a wanting to go into the of an hidden in the woods to write a story about how it works etc when our hero is given the grand show by dr. head of the we see all kinds of things which are to be such as men hanging around long in a and such as our hero being upon by soldiers as he down a hanging over the 
 boring horrible piece of italian about a scientist who seems to spend most of his time beer this is what makes him american right our scientists spend most of their academic life out of their minds sure that 's where all the really great theories come from who 's studying something calls fish patterns who knows he a weird sound through his proving that his radio is picking up a station in jamaica at the same time a jack girl 
 i really felt after seeing this picture it felt like i sat watching this movie N minutes for nothing i do n't understand what they were thinking when they made this it hardly gets into jeffrey and it has no ending it felt almost like they were leaving this movie open for a it was like watching a television episode of the it ends suddenly and you know there 's going to be another episode next week it also felt 
 this is one of the films i 've ever seen it off nearly ever type of and manages to make a mess of them 's not a single good line or character in the whole mess if there was a plot it was an and as far as acting goes there 's nothing good to say so ill say nothing i understand how this type of nonsense gets produced and actually released does somebody somewhere not at some stage think 
 they must be i 'll list them so that you can check them off police regularly leave tens of millions of dollars of cash and drugs just lying around because they do n't have evidence when you get shot you always the same way and fly back the same way even though there 's never a mark on your police are not able to identify the sound of gun shots and do n't think anything is when an 's phone 
 movies have put me to sleep before but no movie has ever done that twice so it took me three actually to finish it the was bad women spoke and the men were and two of the supposedly japanese women looked chinese had chinese names and spoke with clearly chinese i 'm still trying to figure out why the men were up with each other N minus N a tough choice do i give this movie a rating of one 
 the plot has already been described by other so i will simply add that my reason for wanting to see this film was to see in all her has to be one of the examples of to have been committed to of her era and only the equally comes close what was it about with musical brothers and peter for those who like me have her scenes in this movie will not she has a figure and none of it 
 hands down the best show on television a written show about a young mother and her N year old daughter exploring life and finding things out not only about the world but themselves too graham struggles to find a way to remain in close bond with her daughter but steer her in the right path which the show is becoming harder and harder caught in a world of books and learning is just beginning to discover boys and her own 
 normally i 'm quite to like low budget films but iii is so that i feel nothing but for looks and feels like a tv show and a particularly one at that the sets are the lighting flat the score and effects and the is film school there 's no plot to speak of the characters are one and the actors are most of the cast look like they should be doing soft core in fact the only reward that 
 this film is boring boring boring boring and boring it 's not the worse film i ever saw on the contrary but how shall i put this it 's boring there is some very nice and some dry but that 's about it if it was advertised as a i would rate it a N but it 's supposed to be a film with a plot some drama and for god 's a point or a satisfying read some of 
 big fat is the best movie ever it is funny and cool proves that he was not lying and goes to los angeles to get his paper back from wolf paul along with friend mess up his life since wo n't call ' and say he wrote the paper yet it all turns out good and is a good movie to watch 
 here on earth N out of four mark 's here on earth holds the record for a movie containing the most recycled material in N minutes literally every and familiar plot element are somewhere in here there is simply nothing unique original or fresh about it god what an motion picture to sit through i wish i saw the film during its theatrical release last year so it could have earned on my year 's worst list this is the 
 like the previous two max ' films max beyond ' is not exception to the violence and strange plot mad max is in a society where he must destroy master and get the children to land ' this is generally a film with peter pan and turner and odd characters i got very by watching it all and it offered nothing to me i did not feel inspired after watching this film the only decent thing about this film were

 despite positive reviews and at the international this movie is not for story is very similar to other movies in which a girl from the family of needs to overcome many common personal problems of her age and also to struggle against the pressure of ethnic in her family she does that by choosing some kind of sport and with the help of a local boy that for some reason falls in love with her she her problems and it 
 should you wish to see the worst film ever made look no further some movies are because they are funny american movie has no at all no humor just thought by its director to be those who liked this film i suggest you watch kevin smith 's similar in tone in you will find creativity and all on a budget it should make you forget this effort 
 the makers of this fine film did a job of getting you involved with the characters as they suffered through this horrible scene in the woods was done so that you forget that these men were just actors playing have never gotten so in a film as i have this reynolds and jon were never better on screen as well as fine performances by cox bill and though he appeared only briefly james the man who the book upon which 
 i saw this hot movie when it came out in it had a x rating for a brief scene involving oral sex but played in mainstream it was an art film supposedly it 's the first film to ever show a respected actress in an explicit sex i saw was a boring tale about a high school boy in love with an older woman as has been mentioned before is very beautiful with a good body but she also gave 
 this movie surprised me some things were and some technological elements reminded me of the movie enemy of the state will smith but for the most part very good mix with jamie and mike and the N and providing some comic relief this is a movie you can watch over some wednesday night when nothing else is on i gave it a N for entertainment value 
 like some people here i in norway it got aired a lot later that also means that we are in the episode that 's right i have to say that i really love it can make me cry and so on i think i 'm going to die the day we reach episode number might be the on series except from grey 's that i really watch the actors are amazing especially i think she is one of the best 
 what could be more than the idea of private getting involved with the women they 're supposed to be on and most of the dialogue as written is perfectly the actors turn the into something that makes sense you can see real people behind the lines and the is wonderful each scene does just what it has to and ends without dragging on too showed this to several friends in the because i was at how such bad material could 
 just saw it the story the plot the script makes no sense its the part N without the ring its characters showing up out of the blue for no reason its by everyone no one knows why its showing her true two of them its special effects its a few good actors their did i mention 's two do i have to say more its just awful even for standards its just the lowest what a waste by the way 
 this movie was one of the most boring movies i have seen in a long time and i have seen a lot personally i liked the take on it all that was original but other than that it was pretty i could not stand as an actor nor as a singer i seemed that he was trying with everything he said to make it a quote which they were n't i can get movies for free and i still did 
 certainly not horrible but definitely not the country N was directed by and written for the screen by ronald adapted from the N novel by alan james jones and richard film is about south africa and the stories of a black man and a white man the but stephen james jones receives a letter from saying that he must come immediately he later finds that his son has killed a man the rich james richard harris finds that his son 
 the first of this film was n't that to the american films of the and two in ancient mexico to the law and were doomed to die one became an whose job it was to guard the and his lady love and the lady was in the present day and the was naturally attracted to her so far it 's all the typical film though it 's quite a bit slower and than the american versions oh and of course 
 i admit to a lot of the so-called movies no matter how bad they are i can find something to like about ben or owen wilson or or will or jack black but envy just left me about as cold as the white horse that ben of this time it 's ben and jack black as a couple of neighbors one of whom black a to make animal disappear and becomes wealthy while the other in envy that 's supposedly 
 as a note i 'd like to say that i saw this movie at my annual church camp where the entire youth group at it i bought it when i saw it on a shelf one year later if only for the humor i derived from a bad attempt at making an movie lay it down falls short of many movie fans ' expectations on several different planes most of the problems lie within the acting regardless of the nice 
 first runs town and country and now this the difference between that and this is that town and country was this can only that the cast signed up for this so they could off in europe on somebody else 's is especially his scene with candy doing a was speaking of five minutes of the and i bet the at would crack like the real crime besides this being is 's character a wife who takes a monte casino for 
 those N points are dedicated the reasonable performance from i know films do not really to be realistic but please a walt disney production is more realistic than this plot the father is dying and does what any good parent does kick his son out the son with his pregnant wife a few things that were too hard to pool in the ' and to go from that to living in her garden shed suddenly got the job as a

 i read reviews on this movie and decided to give it a shot i 'm an open guy after all and i given good reviews to some pretty bad as the end credits rolled on this one i searched for meaning and something nice to say here goes this film was short that 's all i the sets and were well done and the music helped lend to the mood of life but the film was painful to watch and 
 why did i buy this movie on well the short answer would be i really do n't know as for the longer version it pretty much comes down to the fact that i like and she plays in does give a good effort in this movie i must say that it is one of the better and she is shaping up to be a rather decent actress i am very much looking forward to see her in action when better 
 this movie has been a classic in my part of the country because it was in my own small town i now have many friends who are guards at and i myself worked for N at the store next to the store the old lady was at however this is still the movie ever made to be introduced by or if it has n't been already a bit of illinois does n't even have hearings and prison is a medium 
 it 's great to see fox in a role where she gets to a lot also loved hearing her nice change to see her out of her roles the movie itself was entertaining but it seemed some explanation in a lot of parts several of the characters seemed to be one minute and happy the next and it was left up to your to figure out why each character was though and in some cases i could n't wait to 
 i usually come on this prior to going to the movies as i like to see what other people think of the movie i read many reviews which said not a movie ' this prompted me to give this film a try i really must take issue with these ' statements as it was neither i almost went and asked for my money back and if you lot of enjoyed this well you must be easily pleased at the end 
 my interest was raised as i was through and saw the name my name is so i thought ok lets see what this is i am so glad i stayed on the channel what a wonderful wonderful story drama some over the top acting but a wonderful time to be had i watch this and it makes me sad for all the the movie industry puts out and these beautiful little get passed over give a try and i hope 
 said the announcer as tactical assault was about to be broadcast after seeing the first two minutes i started thinking might want to get a new agent after seeing the next ten minutes i started thinking might want to retire thereby saving a potential audience from any more of his performances this is a truly terrible movie i was n't expecting much and why should i if the name appeared in the credits but within seconds of the opening title 
 had a great cast of wonderful actors greene michael dan and even guy williams as the who was brought in for several episodes during N to replace when he was leaving the series the cast had chemistry and they seemed to like each other that made many of their weakest stories work a lot better than they should have it also made many of their best stories into great western any show that was shooting over episodes every season there 
 i am usually a big fan of advocate but since of a woman he pretty much plays the same role and a lot this movie had no characters to warm to played by is the least of the bunch he nowhere even approached a real human being was and my how old is the only high light of this mess was the hot hooker with the perfect and she has like N lines total even the usually was utterly to 
 alert although this is a plot almost as impossible to as it is to completely explain drive ' is by far the most successful expression of david lynch 's style and vision since the first season of his ' tv series as lynch enthusiasts know his is a style and vision from film movies and with a healthy of and black humor thrown in for good measure all these elements are at work in drive ' making for a and 
 oh this is so bad it is funny the only way one could explain something like this is a party with drugs that resulted in the resolution to make a movie just for fun i mean you get to see having sex then killed by human there is plenty of including the classic something is wrong with her oh no it 's half the person she used to be and the murder caused by panic but you can also find 
 this movie was promising my favorite actor in a historical drama during the independence war it had memories from with for the big indians military fights & from barry for the british & lights unfortunately the script is awful the of the story is lacking cuts with N months later N years later & the is so ridiculous that it 's hard to believe in it america is a big country but the characters kept at each other above all 
 some movies you just know you 're going to love from the first few seconds this is one of those movies it 's roots back to double and the always twice in the N 's this was a great example of modern film in the N 's plays the down on his luck main character who gets in a murder plot and his luck goes from bad to worse to even worse as he tries and tries to get away 
 of all the of books by i feel that this as the worst but blame it would appear that all that this film shares with the novel is the same title we have no no sense of of mystery no chance to really with the main characters we spend the entire or at least i did waiting for charlotte to shed her clothing for charlotte this appears to take a long time still a of charlotte really save this film 
 i am for the i needed something to keep me from going with tension anxiety what if it is n't as good and constant lack of information i needed something to calm me a little something to pass the time other than of course the this was just the thing i found it like the part about 's neck and some of it was funny i much when she said there was only one and all those guys i found 
 set in venice mainly on the 's death in venice is a of combining the of 's and expert photography of the resort area in all its various daily for those who love venice this is a film to 's music frequently heard throughout the film the drama the mood it creates is not always happy but then what else would you expect with a title like that there is not a lot of dialogue in the film rather in

 yes we all know about dan 's odd little with making shows with young kids and is no exception see young their and stick their out for the camera and wear clothes and 's yes it makes you wonder if these shows were made for or for some older crowd either way the show is n't that good when compared to dan other shows like the far superior show & and show is about a brother and sister and spencer 
 on the face of it has set out to make a psychological although it 's not as satisfying as a classic piece in that there are the generated between and as women but at war over a boy they both claim are compelling however in a true european style does n't give us release of this tension as the women also try to each other the only raised voice is that of 's from a nightmare an event in the

 watched levy comedy murder mystery with very few the movie appears to be based on an earlier italian movie according to the credits but was by two fairly popular american romantic comedy writers but this one by charles & nancy does not cut it compared to their other efforts the story is about a couple of traveling americans played by richard lewis and young who upon a lost dog and hope to make a fortune in reward money after seeing 
 i 've seen a slew of over the years from like on tour to fun like party massacre somehow i managed to keep putting this one off which is strange because it 's probably the most popular and well received one well i finally caught up with it and it 's easily the best of this mostly awful but almost always the plot which was pretty much lifted in the film black concerns a named eddie whose by all in 
 this version of the stories is definitely bizarre the production adds a frame story that 's what it 's becoming famous for of returning to his wife and son in one and sometimes fails to hold attention throughout but the odd images and diverse cast will keep you looking mary does the best job of the cast seems a bit out of place with his american the whole thing is disturbing often but is nonetheless interesting and holds the of

 the cast was good and i thought it was a good performance from christopher lloyd whom i like from previous movies the movie was a great family movie nothing that would make you worry to show it to younger kids a good story line lots of and if you want to children without being to this fits the bill kid and not difficult for a parent to watch either 
 i agree with the above comment i love the in this and in many movies not just movies on eating disorders the producers seem to forget that they take an every day problem and create a dramatic scene and then come the end of the movie everything is perfect again which i dislike because its not reality not meaning to say things ca n't get better and not meaning to say things do n't in this movie but it does

 this is a great movie i love it more each time i watch most can get pretty because you know all the but mystery men has so much integrity in the writing and that watching once again as ben at the of the or says to or rush his or tom while he watches the news report or refuses a from paul is a pleasure this is pitch perfect acting the story develops directly and consistently the action are creative 
 i was really looking forward to watching this film it had all the of a great in but it just did n't come together at all kevin 's was except that sometimes he to use it and i would rather not have had to listen to linda 's pale attempt she and were totally lacking in and their screen kids had so you could find at least some members of his N families you could have with the plot and

 there is nothing i hate more in a movie than and this is one of the most films ever made it 's is obvious in every frame see what a sophisticated film we are making the director and seem to be saying to us and to themselves they say lets 's see how we can and the audience even more i would rather watch the worst film by ed wood or edgar g. than something like this at least they

 there is a lot wrong with this film i will not lie i will say that most of the problems feel like they stem from a budget that was out from the and some bad job is not office space do not go in expecting office space levels of comedy it is very funny though it is a mess but very funny at the same time a funny mess of a film in the way that is funny a mess

 as other viewers have mentioned this film was an interesting experiment in photography the colors are comic book bold i think the director got carried away with his artistic vision over the look of the film instead badly needed attention to content despite its cast the performances are lackluster and the story nearly was likely cast as a to get press a good thing as her appearance here lent some to her i 'm music inspired by the film dick

 the idea a very short film with a lot of information interesting entertaining and leaves the wanting more the producer has produced a short film of excellent quality that can not be compared to any other short film that i have seen i have rated this film at the highest possible rating i also recommend that it is shown to office managers and business people in any establishment what comes out of it is the fact that people with ideas

 the film itself is only a of scenes which have no inherent meaning to someone living outside of russia i wo n't deny that some of the images and techniques were quite revolutionary at the time N but the problem with the film is that it has no interest to the intellectual or common man we are merely watching an arranged form of pictures ranging from a one arm man beating a horse to a in the war everything in 
 i was previously that in the early N 's university or was it itt added film to its wonderful of technical degree programs well this movie must have been the product of the class my friend and i the original N on my and this movie was on the side of the do not waste your time with this movie awful awful awful the adds N main character 's a woman and her the woman has been having dreams about 
 i did n't realize just how much of this episode was taken from the enemy below until i finally saw the movie it has since become my war there were a couple of elements lifted from run silent run deep as well nothing wrong with stealing ideas as long as you do something cool with them and boy did and company do something cool with this story begins when the violate a old treaty and by crossing the neutral zone 
 my first exposure to japanese director and his studio production company was when an version of away was released about N years ago what a creative and unique film experience that was so on that note i managed to get my movie friend to see this new film of with me especially since he all things disney this movie 's u.s. distributor once again all i can say is what concerning the way water is as the ocean and what 
 nothing characters with no do n't the end never comes because there 's no beginning and no are beautiful shots that are made not beautiful because they are n't even allowed to be because this movie is n't even there there 's no is in this movie because there 's no plot or characters or themes or ideas or or discussion or or point there 's nothing there is a good point it has a good but the sound is

 i went into this movie expecting a piece about how to be accepted in culture and i wound up $ on a N minute joke and a whole bunch of fake sorry jeff but if you 're going for the whole thing you got a while to go 
 i 'm so glad he was n't alive to see this this movie is a of his work i agree with the other this movie was a terrible disappointment i 'd give it a zero but am forced to give it a story was weak and it reminded me of the days when i was a young trying to write a movie then looking back on it and how horrible it was bad actors family and friends and someone stupid 
 some movies are but but many movies are just weird fits in the latter category many seem to like it because of endless guest appearances and a total lack of sense but those two things can only take a movie so far and simply does n't have any other merits to its credit itself on plot its main character is a old on a across an country trying to collect game pieces to win $ N million when with adult 
 high is perhaps the most of the it is one of the few films in the that is throughout that being said it also relies heavily on the standard formula a group of young men and women get killed one by one until the final reason why high stands above most movies in its is that it goes more the killer has good reason to hold a against his former they him as he stood naked in a girl 's 
 this is without a doubt one of the most accomplished debut films for any director the movie is only N minutes long but manages to say just about everything about life and death not much action and dialogue is minimal but the movie flows perfectly and demands your attention due to the natural feel of everything going on the performances by the leads are and even some supporting characters get strong emotional scenes the movie will be somewhat lost on 
 i have been on since through season when i in to see N minutes early thanks to i now have all but N episodes on tape right up through last night i am a straight male and this is the only weekly tv show i watch i love this series because a graham is a damn woman and funny and smart to b the dialogue is extremely c it is putting garbage like everybody raymond to shame many current tv 
 this movie was beautiful and it touched a place deep inside me and i 'm not sure why i am a married woman and i 've never had but my this movie almost made it something i the the the the movie was a work of art the without is that a woman with her life and looking for something anything she is with a man who does not want a baby but she does he 's not mean to 
 a christmas story is a holiday classic and my favorite movie so naturally i was when this movie came out in i saw it opening day and was prepared to enjoy myself i came away and the anticipation that true in a christmas story is missing from this mess a red ryder gun is better to get than a chinese it is not very funny at all charles is good but the buck stops there bottom line N star do 
 can indeed be funny and at times and is always but this takes the this show showed 's job is set in new york plays mike a who is married has a drug problem and has a girlfriend has serious attitude so much he 's in it the is filled with funny interesting and characters besides an excellent cast too all of the episodes in this show are really funny and are the one in this show are everywhere you 
 this is a nice little lifetime movie about a guy peter who 's living the perfect suburban middle class life when late one night the police suddenly into his home and arrest him for the murder of some guy N years his prison cell to his wife the events of N years ago and how he came into contact with wayne kennedy the man who he supposedly here the story is told in fashion and the more you learn about 
 watching with a view called undertaking in the us i got the feeling that there need to be more movies in this one a woman in a small town trying to get away from her cheating husband so she and the manager alfred come up with a plan but there are likely to be some along the would actually say that christopher 's character is the in the movie how could he not be but overall the whole idea is 
 there seems to be a whole of cheap tired old sex out there that say the same old things about middle class couples sort of like friends but with more soft and no this film is no it had situations so familiar i died from people sat on out about sex and relationships check cheating with some who would never look twice in reality at some other check the N check some in it who happens to be the only 
 the first time i saw the i was stunned by its and beauty then the city of has been in my mind ever much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as and like a it itself is a there are a lot of things going on in the film but the director deliberately omitted most dramatic parts and leave them to our thus creating a really flat life mild one can see 's in the toilet and 
 i 'll just put it out here that was the worst to a classic disney film i 've ever seen in N disney released what i as one of his greatest films of all time now take away the great add a poor plot that resembles that of a lost tv show put it together and what do you get the biggest load of i 've ever seen after i saw this i thought it was all over for disney 
 being a fan of the and of go man lady violence jack etc i was looking forward to this one i 'd seen neither the nor the so i had no going in good thing too what we have here is a series of silly movies of the type that used to turn up with on cable channels late at night while it 's compared to what gets down the of regular cable viewers our hero 's are either away 
 if you 're looking for a movie that 's fun to watch simply because you can make jokes about the not so great acting special effects and typical plot then this is the movie for you not at the acting was bad in fact a few actors were actually fairly decent the special effects were n't the greatest to say the least the animals looked completely computer there was an to cover up the and there was only one song 
 it really is a great film after being able to ignore edwards which he appears to be with and are is as usual wonderful and acting i remember seeing it at the odeon in the london on its release however 's at the premiere of star was most unfortunate and apparently due to the shots for over ireland a reasonable excuse if she had appeared in any of these shots but she did not two box office in a row 
 while 's movies have always been with me with to story they are to the eye with characters of simple against a backdrop of artistic images to that formula with a lead character so i want a of her and so pretty it would n't look out of place up as a picture on a story on the other hand i did n't enjoy quite as much as his last two away and 's moving castle it was just a 
 i guess intended this movie to be the definition of the cool it has the cool approach of the late early same rouge a bitter and story is also the of and in is a who has in his flat three and a daily routine is a is a sick failed plays an escaped suspect rouge is of course far above a movie uses his techniques detailed of every step of the etc yet this particular action drama is far 
 for the life of me why did this film receive an r rating while it is about believe it or not it 's actually a pretty good film at least if your kids are age N and older unlike the traditional films this one has an excellent sense of humor as well as a traditional values a bit the language is n't a serious problem there is no and the film style is definitely geared kids much like the old 
 following the release of N N and playing off the alleged success of the original N director takes the liberty of bringing us the third installment in the the in the of a giant and institution time and place unknown two operators bennett and dodd david sit and on monitors the behavior of people that have been placed in a giant network of cubic chambers some of which are with death told that the people they are are convicted who 
 the only reason i did n't score this a one is that does show that he is at the technical aspects of making a film it is a technically having been said this is a film based on lies and that are quite easily most of the is spent using propaganda techniques to the space program rather than actual fact and 's proof that the were is easily if you know anything about do not recommend watching this but if 
 if you have n't seen this yet i say just move on take a walk in the park do n't waste your time neither the scenario nor the acting is worth your money i ca n't decide which was worse the movie itself or baldwin 's 's acting talent is very questionable i hope she can improve it over time the is just loose american fighting criminals in europe on his own protected by only two an emotional art teacher 
 warning you people out there this is just a waste of your time i am being honest when i 'm saying that this is the worst movie i 've ever seen its just a move about christian propaganda do n't throw away your life do n't see it i think they made the movie so more people will believe in or something but it works in the opposite way the actors are all the story is just i think this 
 very very movie fare here with stevens taking from someone in it did n't take me long to guess who it was in old nevada town outside vegas for a money in the circus circus hotel in las vegas stevens leads her girl gang of three and they find out that they must act much than had been anticipated despite some neat looks at las vegas in the N 's very average yet credible acting from most involved and a 
 oh where the hell should i begin give a brief summary of the story no either you 've already heard it or do n't want to either way it much like the movie i happen to be a movie and i must say this is one of the and most movies i 've ever had the of the script is stupid the story starts too fast with absolutely no or in the all of those scenes would have been a 
 i just saw this movie tonight nov. N for the first time i wanted to watch it cause i saw the basketball di and loved that but this was far more heavy going i think it had a good of drugs to an extent i mostly with character probably because if i someone i was crazy about was on that stuff i 'd want to help them get off it a promising student and who spends all his time training 
 i was told jon was for on i the film will be fact is n't at all not so much for a such subject life after death and the film is not as a comedy but is n't funny at all at least not express yet it 's so film but film a must to avoid the middle ages seems coming directly from and it 's not the matter at all is so and is doing his best normal is 
 i wo n't try to speculate as to what was attempting at his best he turns in such performances so many things at once that it does n't seem he does anything so much as play by often it seems he is calling attention to some favored aspect of his character over all others a concentration which if followed turns out something of a red as he turns out than at first appeared this is a of not as might 
 a most not only for the underlying themes of the story but also for the brilliant and picture work of not to mention the acting of giants and and the remarkable character play by gregory 's performance may seem by his tough partners ' at first stance but in fact he perfectly plays his character which is revealed in his very last scene with the girl and the man hinted hence the get your expectations straight it 's an art 
 did this movie blow the characters were weak the plot weaker i figured this could n't be too bad because it has he must have done this because he was and needed the money the characters were supposed to be irish but had an irish i am desperately trying to find something nice about this i ca n't except did a fine job with a wooden character find something to read or watch discovery do n't ever see this movie 
 after high-school best friends alice and decide to take a trip to thailand they are there they meet a australian guy named after spending some time with he asks them if they want to take a weekend trip to hong kong with him they agree at the airport though they are get for drugs and then get convicted for N years in a prison for something they say they have n't done not really knowing what to do they end 
 this film is more about how children make sense of the world around them and how they and we use to make sense of it all i think it 's been everyone going in expecting a wo n't enjoy it but if you want a deeper story it 's here 
 this is very much i guess it carries some value for many people it has its moments but every scene is heavily and the plot is quite with this cast it could have been much better 
 i saw at a showing a few days ago and found it to be a and film the film is about a american actress who goes to india to act in a low budget film only to find herself there when she finds on that the film 's financing has along with the producers and investors a chance with an indian film shooting nearby leads her to be hired for a small role in that since indian films a significant 
 humor is present in large quantities the acting and story are wonderful if you can the concept those with weak will have some difficulty since the are realistic enough to cause of more than a few in the and kate the but the young could get some serious time on screen over the next few has developed from a face into a strong young actress with and wonderful comic delivery the story does a spectacular job in dealing with friendship 
 this is to the movies as the star movies were to star except that in this case every one of the was more entertaining and interesting than this big and also better made if substance is more important than surface had i never seen them i would have thought this but empty since i had i thought its style inappropriate and its content insufficient the idea of the character in a bigger production must have sounded good but there was 
 this is a film that is far more than its rating of N would suggest in many ways it 's like a version of valley of the with much of the excesses and of valley up a bit for the audiences of like this later film both are about three young who are on the to success though this time it 's in the publishing world instead of the entertainment industry though one of the in the best of everything 
 i loved this movie this film was filled with plot good acting great story and a surprising ending to be completely honest this movie was n't overly it does contain some though but was more on the psychological side i read it on the the film cost N dollars and was shoot in N days amazing this is for someone that wants to think and great film making what starts out as a slowly into something a bit more even 
 my summary hints that this is not a good film but this is not true i did enjoy the movie but was probably expecting too who is portrayed by susan did not come off as a very character she is and irresponsible to what would be an degree were it not for the tremendous love she has for her daughter this is the one thing she knows how to do without fail 's daughter is a sad girl who is 
 this one of the best and comedy series i have ever seen all characters are david is a very very man by everything and wants to do things and handle situations as best as he possibly can but he never gets it right and only gets himself deeper and deeper in trouble not supported by his wife who only tries to get him deeper and deeper into the trouble he is getting himself into and really does not need the 
 this movie is not worth the time it takes to put it in the or player michael and howard are two in love yet they are total she is ambitious and organized while he is laid back and totally this movie bad guys are chasing jersey 's character this opens the door to bad fight scenes and tony playing the most looking boss i have ever seen the ending has to be the most scene i have seen in a 
 the only thing remarkable about this movie is that all the actors could bomb at the same time i want my money back and i got it free from the library i would rather on fool and my head with a then watch this again 
 this is where the term classic film comes from this is a wonderful story of a woman 's and extreme loyalty poor got sold to her husband who through the years learned to appreciate her right a was the beautiful star who had won the best actress the year before for her small role and what a waste of an in the great it really did n't show what if any talent she had other than her exotic beauty but 
 is an awful movie it is so simple it seems they tried to make a movie to show the life just like did many years ago but unfortunately lacks good young actors leon are by many still the little girl in and is simply not good enough to play such an important role several times in the movie she plays with out soul and this is destroying the movie even though i consider it a movie you ought to see 
 i ca n't stand people who comment on this program or other hbo programs as too or or that they contain etc what prison life is n't the content is true to life of this situation prison contains deals and if you do n't like it then do n't watch the program i 'm certainly no fan of prison rape but if it was left out of the show i 'd be surprised and lend the show less credibility if 
 a very bad attempt at a young tap at least the music in tap was is really a very sad case of hollywood at it 's worst a bunch of hollywood bad musicians and producers create some show so their kids can be in the oh please the humor was even bad i hate this stuff when there is really kids musicians actors and artists out there their to have success and this comes u all why was n't gene 
 a dedicated fan to the movies with the first one being a and the second probably the best disney has produced along comes this film now i 'm not arguing with voice work music but this is no more than a in the atmosphere although it is n't bad it does n't add anything basically this movie is one big joke and that 's about all that it make a real disney the potential is 
 this feels very and to a great extent the whole plot is extremely forced especially the effort to save the college from and the especially by the leading lady a there are one or two comic moments that do help relieve the and the is quite fun especially for alleged the shop and the young guy doing spectacular tap were particular and i liked peter of charles and ronald coleman as well 
 i love this movie as a kid this was one of the first movies i saw that made me sure it is mild now but back in the day it was are one thing so many people fear so why not do a movie about a killer it 's it 's fun sometimes it 's scary but it is and i have always had a love for medical and plays dr. perfectly no one could have done it better and 
 this movie is very cool if you 're a fan of and chinese fantasy films you should love this this film is the asian lord of the a high fantasy story based in actual chinese i realize many critics have called this film i think they probably have zero knowledge of chinese if you liked or of & earth this one should be right up your alley this film is still very difficult to find in the u.s. even though 
 i must begin by saying that this is one of the most films i have seen in my entire life factor number one never seeing the son 's face for the entire movie and the more factor that ringing phone nothing but listening to the phone ring over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over you get my point the old man was being but 
 i loved this movie it 's the of russian to date who else but could so you thought was slow well step up to the plate i makes look like raiders of the lost ark by no means should you miss this film there 's no excuse even if you live a busy life you can still enjoy this film to its by holding down the on your has given us the first feature length film that can be in 
 contains really bad so what can i say about this it 's a really horrible and awful movie much and special effects you could tell how fake the ridiculous baby is at least go watch and which is another terrible pile of of the makes and way better pure i hate this trash i would also like to say that N was also a really stupid just as stupid as son of the N was just as fake as son 
 worked seven years to complete this two hour film about the crime underground in chile and perhaps that is one of the reasons the film seems and in need of or maybe this is the technique of a director who shows a fine sense of film brothers the and victor the younger have moved to from their home in after their parents ' death and works to support victor 's education on victor 's birthday takes the virgin out to 
 released as king in the film was essentially the first film to go on general release in the u.k. many of us had through 's and involving and were used to film being shot and with somewhat all in all like through an of very fine still photographs that just happened to be come run run shaw and co. with their home movie production values and and all the rules have changed king was the first in through the door 
 saw this movie last night i do n't usually comment good or bad as i think movies are like books in that there is something for everyone and everyone is different vary this movie was bad by the end i thought oh my this is testing my patience how many women really look and live like this when they hit rock bottom and if i could just borrow some cash from and carry out to live my fashion designing dreams 
 i thought they should have called this movie whites instead of heights the kind of film that makes people hate new people who are so and think their lives are so important give me a break such a white cast that glenn close was the most ethnic character in it this film was out for someone real to come in and steal it and so they introduce get this a character even than the rest of the cast i thought 
 i felt to comment on this film because it 's listed as the fourth of all time on the what sure this movie is but it 's it 's not awful on an ed wood level it 's more and are some classic moments in the film the brain surgery is gross and and even when you consider that the film was rated chasing after his before getting battery acid dumped on his mine 's at the beginning of the 
 i 'll say it again one of the worst films ever made and it was made by the director that made one of my most favorite films i was to see it got a grade of over six this movie it looked terrible it looked like it was shot in N days and must 've been sleeping when he directed this did n't do anything just plain terrible and probably the only in 's 
 i have seen three other movies that are worse than this one plan N from side and the blair project there are so many technical errors in this movie that regardless of a decent plot the movie just is n't 's start with an train with no or between cars the killer walks up behind his victim as she moves from car to car and just her off the one scene a killer into a woman 's apartment he wants 
 i remember seeing this movie a long time ago on television i remember the of the movie being about a bunch of hotel being attacked by what i did n't remember was how awful it was i recently caught this movie on television late at night i 'm sure it must have been a mistake because movies like this usually disappear from and are never to be found again at the pinnacle of her career playing on 's company ' 
 i did n't know a lot about this film going into it but i did find out that kane was a which did n't exactly me but i liked santa 's and that had a in it so what the hell the story begins very and but after a while becomes not much more than your typical although the helped some a bunch of criminal young folks get up and taken to an old hotel that used to be a 
 as someone else mentioned it begins with a bizarre about a little girl killing a cat then the main story a and a writer meet by chance and take a trip into the first they spend the night at an where the slightly gets at with increasing to the audience by once in the they seek shelter again and are invited in by a old lady who seems overly to and anyone what happens next i will leave for the 
 although this film never commercial my experience has led me to conclude that many pieces of artistic expression often do not gain mass appeal the story line a young boy stealing a car and on a with very little basis in our of time and space therefore anyone who attempts to view this film from the perspective of its to reality will likely be disappointed it is not intended to be realistic it is however intended to be with extensive 
 ok if i was in the rental store and someone asked me if the movie was worth the three for the rental i 'd have to say no the plot was i 've come to the conclusion that can not act he can at times be painful to watch though my wife thinks he 's dan who is usually great was even a little disappointing as the on the plus side the plot because it is is was good 
 this is an amazing film both for the energy from the and from the unique way that the the story of the stage production with the lives of the characters preparing for it is the only word i can use to describe the experience this is not 's ' by any usual standard this is not a usual film by any standard every every of the foot every piece of the music is so that you ca n't take your 
 i only bought this because it was cheap and it seemed interesting in its own special way special meaning the movie turned out to be quite boring camera work nothing really driving the story and of course the acting is horrible it was n't even bad in a way it was just plain bad there are actually a handful of great lines of dialogue but for the most part its and weak all i could think about while watching this 
 i have yet to read a negative professional review of this movie i guess i must have missed something the beginning is intriguing the three main characters meet late at night in an otherwise empty bar and each other with invented stories that 's the best part after the three go their separate ways the film into three that 's when sets in certainly the with the who make out of bread is at first an eye opening unfortunately the 
 it seems like so far only the fans have on this film time for a this is long those not in the knowing mostly the tom director of this film is the of one of the better known rock of the late N 's here in belgium basically they made a couple of very and innovative and quickly rose to fame on the national scale then started hurting and the band basically fell apart with and a couple of others 
 used to think was the worst actor in hollywood i not so sure anymore gives some stiff competition with his i 'm made of performance in this that with the fact that there is almost no plot and not a single character and it 's pretty hard to recommend this tries her best but even roberts could n't save this from it unless it 's really late and there 's nothing else on in that case just read a book 
 just felt like another of the i know what you did last summer trend and is painfully a high school who is heavily into and black magic is killed during a carried out by a group of who her in the woods to tell no one the next day the supposedly dead at school with a completely new image and her would-be and has a little this is basically a combination of the craft and every other turkey that hits 
 talk about if you really want to sit down and watch this episode where the girl who was in later on gets there 's entertainment for you but only if you like this sort of thing i do n't so i thought to be frank this episode was it 's one of a few duff episodes in season N and the only charles grant craig episode so you do n't get much of this sort of thing in season so 
 after nearly getting killed by a big dog a cat thinks to herself why ca n't i be a then everyone would leave me alone she looks around the and gets an idea white black and some and some the next thing you know we have the to although in this she 's still a cat she 's a she and just a in the cat also is enjoying and taking full advantage of her new status as a he 
 remember ralph the guy that was an on then on paramount studios after that he was a director on the cat N & N and heavy traffic well this is and it 's actually pretty good but good the movie takes place in nights no it was a working title but with a twist that becomes a of a disney movie song of the 's about barry white and the charles rush to help their friend philip michael thomas escape 
 the robin cook novel had already been turned into a pretty successful movie in a couple of years later it was the turn of another robin cook to get the big screen treatment but in the case of virtually everything that could go wrong does go wrong this is a consisting of wooden performances stupid dialogue characters and the only reason it a rating is that the egyptian backdrop provides more than the story itself hard to believe franklin j. 
 i i can see why critics give this film two out five stars it is n't but i think it is worth a look from director levy cheaper by the dozen night at the museum basically malcolm in the middle 's is often lying to his parents and teachers and his teacher warns him that if he does n't do his creative writing he will fail his whole and have to repeat the grade during summer so he his work 
 this must be one of the most arrogant films i 've ever seen what a waste of budget and actors has reached new levels of it is clear there is virtually no plot even if this part of history is material for great movies he simply had some supposedly actually scenes in his mind and he built a whole movie around them death is the main theme and is repeated ad along with and the like which should only be 
 i like so many others on here bought this movie at my local in the two for $ i love b and movies and this one definitely fits in that category pretty much what everyone else on here said is dead on yes it was bad but that was to be expected the main problem i had with this movie is that it was just basically boring i mean serious the acting was bad the k mart outfit N were 
 i ca n't believe this movie was made as recently as it 's got some acting not to mention one of the ever who would ever ask fat texas joe don baker to an italian he illegally arrested in mexico back to italy not to mention that the title of the movie tells you pretty much nothing about it in fact it 's about as generic a title for a film as i can think 'm glad i only saw 
 some people say this is the best film that ever released i 'm not too sure about that since i have a place in my heart for some of their i will say that this is probably one of the most unique films they or any other studio major or minor ever plot is simple the ghost of a executed has returned to the to kill all those who him as well as all of their off spring into this 
 i really liked this film when it was released and i still do because the makes you feel hopeful about life in general and people too one of the things i like about the films of lawrence in addition to the positive from the film there are other reasons to like grand for one thing it has an outstanding cast kevin and danny for example in my opinion crash the highly film that won the for best picture was very 
 ocean 's N starts off on and gets worse from there on like a celebrity presentation each major is introduced in short scenarios that seem to stop just short having a now sign the first N minutes of the film are poorly and at times utterly unrelated to the story and confusing speaking of the story there is one but its barely visible for all the look at me shots and only seemed to actually act during this film the 
 it might have been a good movie if it had something more interesting rather than just the surface of a relationship if this was the meaning of the movie it is quite predictable not that the two resemble the russian group i do n't think so there is nothing original in this movie to support it so they had to use something which is already know the the other actors well i just do n't know what their role is 
 sure he became rapidly after this film but from in the water up till the roman could always be counted on to deliver something and unique despite many running themes no two of his films are really alike the story of this is somewhat similar to his own from ten years earlier but the tone is completely different the manages to balance than dark i 'm a bit on calling it humor even though the bizarre behavior and was occasionally 
 this film itself from the wonder of the human body by if to in the in one scene the camera closes in on a as a and out of it in another the camera is in a of half food and acid as parts of a pasta drop in from the and into the in a final tour de force the camera takes the on a ride through a forest of hair unfortunately i 'm not making any of this 
 so much for judge and jury which lives up to its nonsense title what good is there the lighting is another movie you ask well that 's perfectly david keith actually does pretty good at chefs and other while being the killer who escaped death row but overall despite some new it 's reasonably stupid has been putting out some productions recently and this one only means so much we the jury find this film guilty for its exposure to 
 i have to say this is an awful movie for the mere fact that when you see this movie on the guide it is listed as a as i watched it i started laughing thinking to myself does this guy actually expect me to believe this is real so i had to look it up and now see that it is a movie but now since it is n't a it is now a movie with bad acting so either 
 i desperately want to give this movie a N i really do some movies especially movies are so budget that they are good a who can implement corn as definitely fits this to ' system the of the movie is definitely its strong point and the and turns it keeping the audience at the edge of their seats really drives the year old student drawing into the as the of the year all i can really say is you dig

 dutch arthur was a real person and his rather nasty life is fairly well this movie which to his life should have used a character because the events are too strong a departure from the facts and the not only that it some interesting details which other versions have included such as the public relations in n.y. and his conversion it is true that he was executed by al but that 's as far as it goes the plate scene

 there 's plenty to appreciate here spectacular locations and flying period and sets and competent writing and acting however to enjoy a drama we need at least one principal who some that we can like or in this bunch of we found only one character who is at all a man in a fleeting peripheral role as their victim from the reviews here it is clear that we are completely out of step but we did not find their behavior

 the guy who wrote directed and in this piece of trash should really consider a change yes i mean you seriously who funded this there are so many writers out there whom money could be better spent on i think the idea is great but the acting script and is just plain awful the jokes are so not funny i understand that they are supposed to be taking the but do it with style this movie is N saturday night

 queen of the desert is always being out as a of australian i found it quite disappointing the lead actors are great is aging guy pearce should do more comedy instead of the roles he chooses and i 've been a fan of hugo since i saw him play ago the is great but if you 've ever been to the australian you 'd know that the air is so clear and the light so brilliant that they could have

 a very strong movie bruce is good and i think there are two cities missed in the list from the list bruce means the woman was a real insurance and she did her property seems to me work in this movie however i do believe in back to the future theory of ' bruce could save the world but not his the theory of parallel the man can meet i do believe there is no problem in that here i

 utterly ridiculous movie which makes fun of the college admission process while it is true that the sat 's is not everything in evaluating a student for admission to college what the movie talks about is utterly ridiculous and not worth nor officials are made to look like stupid people who have an extremely narrow view of the entire process the film is an to high school students who work hard and then have to suffer through a long process

 sometimes you need to see a bad movie just to appreciate the good ones well that 's my opinion anyway this one will always be in the bad movie category simply because all but 's performance was tells of cat a professional thief turned straight after leaving her two years before but her past returns to her as is for the of security software to the company cat works for in order to rescue him she calls on her old

 the writers missed so many opportunities and created so many plot when dave his from the rain i was anticipating the funny sounds that were going to come out of it nothing are you me a truly writer would have not only had a field day with that but it would have eliminated the major problem of the entire audience wondering how a digital can become completely but then work were at least N other similar situations overall small children

 the show is at least partially so is not reality just to be reality which makes me believe at least anyone without face out is a fake in the episode where he to be there is already camera crew on the boat before he gets there can been seen as his boat actors playing officers did n't remove his or the wound in anyway so they work on it which would never happen in also the in the car park

 this movie documents the ball circuit of the much more fun than than though just as this movie is a true of one can not help but with the characters because of their the sole purpose of middle class intellectuals is to document the of the trash and the here the most of trash is extremely well and the characters ' for of all that is glamorous even more of the characters themselves on part of the creating a phenomenon 
 well where to begin let 's just say this avoid this movie at it 's based on a series the movie makes the filled with actors who seem embarrassed to camera work terrible music and enough product placement you want to never visit again this movie is really of the barrel to quote the new yorker broderick their way through this picture with the men who have spotted a rare of in the distance they should pay us some of

 for fans of chris this is probably his best film david plays the perfect to 's baby strokes of comic in his like the let 's say you 're driving along the road with your family bit the the circus boy with a pretty new pet his possible sale speech or the guarantee sale the moments in the film contrast sharply with and 's even after many it 's still fun to see pour everything he had into the role

 i have never seen this movie on its own but like many others who have already i saw it as an episode of really terrible television but someone saw its potential because it 's just been turned into a $ N million called the to the person who asked whether there were any good movies made in the i want to her that it was a golden age for american film with directors like robert altman and martin first coming 
 very good drama although it appeared to have a few blank areas leaving the viewers to fill in the action for themselves i can imagine life being this way for someone who can neither read nor write this film simply of the real world the wife who is suddenly the sole the and their the troubled child who gets knocked up and then typically drops out of school a husband who takes the egg and buys beer with it N

 the story idea is excellent unfortunately the execution lets it movie lacks pace for one thing it should be an exciting ride but it is slow and more than a little think the problem 's mainly in the and there are n't enough obstacles and to up and there are scenes which do n't really move the story along very producers should have seen this in the and insisted upon a major rewrite unfortunately when the producer is also the

 this movie i do n't think i have ever seen a movie so up on shock value the plot was relatively interesting but the was flat and the acting was this could have been an a good movie i think it just relied on it 's i can usually handle scenes and human but it felt like shot it for the of shooting it just one poorly executed film there just is n't anything to be by watching this film 
 this is a great movie it has a story an main character very good acting and killer action this takes place mostly in the year N but shows scenes that take place in past years to explain the story is very well done and there are no kurt russell is a named who is trained from birth to kill and like all of the other soldiers have never had normal lives eventually the military newer younger faster and stronger soldiers

 this film is supposedly about three young people two of whom join the movement and it is really just another film about some beautiful rich people trying to decide who they should bed next the peasants and and the political struggles of the era merely serve as a backdrop literally as we do n't hear the say a word never mind learn anyone 's name thus they the same ' as the ' in old hollywood films the movie is 
 there are no no to this film they did n't check a single fact not one about anything i feel sorry for larry miller and even more sorry for his agent for not being more capable for finding him a more suitable adults are all the effects are and of any sense of reality the music is the plot is beyond you want to see something good with your family see anything else take some time and check for in 
 romantic can really go either way you know you 'll see one that 's really and you 'll think you want something more realistic then you 'll see one that 's realistic but it might be too to keep you interested or maybe you 'll see one that does everything right but just fails to make you romantic are tough movies you go into them with a lot of expectations and usually whether you like it is simply a matter 
 a big surprise probably because i was expecting it to the reviews were pretty of it even though they all seemed to agree that the concept was golden a man finds out his new girlfriend is a hero and finds when he wants to break up with her that she 's kind of a i kept expecting it to fall apart but it never really did sure it does n't make as much of its as it could and chooses 
 it 's sad when you can see what a movie was attempting to do and it is quite obvious that it fell far far short of the mark film students should take this as a lesson and a warning would be graduate has an idea he wants total control so he writes directs produces his all by himself usually his concept is far beyond his budget usually he writes an script full of every tag line he can come up 
 the best romantic comedy i 've seen in years not the kind of over the top hollywood stuff by ben or and a lot less than a grant and jay are perfectly cast and both deliver smoothly professional performances as the engaged couple who decide to spend a little time their sexual before marriage instead of playing it strictly for the writers and director a nice of human feelings and action is just great as the and does a great 
 i did have some expectations from this film because it was a production when the were first shown on tv they seemed the star cast was new well i must tell u that i just could n't sit through this movie with his red were the make up artists thinking tries hard to look cool but fails i wo n't even get started on his acting if u can call it that queen ' with all her and just makes 
 this is a rather silly little as a period the only reason i wanted to see it in the first place was because i was about what the great henry was really like at his peak i was n't disappointed he produces a truly warm and addition i can say that i was never really at any stage during the film so a strong out of 
 i probably saw this movie first in about since then i 've returned to it many times it 's great i especially like the first and second creation and rising this was so cool back in the glory days of is way older than i am as i know the film was made N years before my time but this film was a landmark in the early it was probably the first collaboration of different experiments set to music i 
 in black jet plays a turned who has to fight against other bad plot bad N million dollar budget but the fighting scenes were excellent jet is the greatest star alive 
 i saw this film prior to joining the british army i went through my basic training at first difficult and then as i much easier my time was spent during the of the troubles in and the cold war there was times when i questioned myself on what i had gotten myself into not for long as the training would always take over and you would always react the voice over used to display what the soldiers are thinking is 
 succeeds in this done film the pace matches the story the direction is and the is perfect the only draw back are one or two slight errors i love film and i am a confessed 
 here 's a movie with a good cast and nice looking location work but it just do n't have it director richard brooks must have been a little bit tired at this stage of the game how much better his the professionals was the horses and the rest of the action seemed to be in slow motion even during the motion scenes this film needed to be if anything that horse sure looked awful phony to me and the obvious 
 do we really need any more garbage on the baby generation technically i am a though at the time when all the of the were reading burning their draft cards and generally a war which destroyed tens of thousands of lives i was still in grade school but i remember them well and N out of N were just who would believe anything as long as it was is just another in from the kids who never really grew up 
 midnight was never a great movie to start with but it is a classic you know it 's a classic the moment its theme song 's talking ' starts up on the actually not written for the film and the way the camera us to joe buck naked and in the we had seen jon before but had never really noticed him but when he tells us he 's ' who 's to doubt him this was a great performance 
 a film i expected very little from and only watched to pass a quiet hour but what an hour it turned out to be roll is an excellent if little story of ' it is funny throughout the characters are and the pace is just is the true star of the film with his portrayal of said country boy and local rules football hero come to the big city to try out for one of the big teams he is 
 this might sound weird but i only got to see the first movie the 's new a week ago and only because of one episode of the tv show i simply 's character but is n't that bad either anyway eventually i decided to watch the second film just so i would 've seen it hoped it would be as good as the first one but i 'm sorry to tell this but the more the got american the more

 this is a movie that should be viewed and treated as a piece of art this is an of love by the brothers about the life of that is full truly artistic elements the movie from color to black and white past to present works by to him all without being confusing in the least bit the only thing that gets me is that the entire movie with the exception of the 's spoken parts is in japanese still a 
 i 've been willing to put up with a lot from action movies but in general that 's been due to the fact that most of them have reasonable cool special effects interesting plot comic value steve etc. this movie however had none of this all that we got was the cheap of several minutes of 's an issue of is cheaper than a movie ticket there is an embarrassing lack of plot back story character development etc i would 
 obviously someone was looking at catching onto the blair movie was set up like all the reality shows that are up on tv lately and i must admit i get a kick out of these but this movie is much probably the first of the movie is filled with the participants going through the house give me a break spending N minutes about going up into the is not my idea of a good time any are no but too 
 can i give this a minus rating no well let me say that this is the most film i have ever tried to watch it was painful the plot is well hidden in several of i this film with a friend and after about minutes of hoping it would get better we decided to fast forward a little to see if things would get any better it never gets better this film about some getting by these two sounds interesting 
 is fun for the audience because it combines the of a comedy with just enough to keep viewers actively engaged and invested in the outcome most though the film is also historically it the tension of the so-called phony war and later the french 's flight from paris ahead of the german yet is not a war movie it is a comedy about the lives of a handful of people set against the backdrop of extraordinary times the chaos confusion 
 a large bed by a people among other things i 'm not making this in N and not officially released until it came to in N death bed the bed that is a movie whose plot is impossible to describe you most likely know of it thanks to 's excellent bit about it as well as stephen essential book nightmare usa while watching it you wonder the is george berry and what drugs did he before writing and this movie 
 written by the writer who the excellent murder rooms series which 's with doctor joseph bell i was looking forward to this and i was n't disappointed it was quite slow moving with a lot of emphasis on doyle 's frustration at holmes which was very accurate and portrayed it was an interesting character study and very well shot on digital video unusual for a period piece the acting was excellent all round particularly tim and brian cox although the 
 this movie i saw it N years ago and in the last years could n't remember it any more name or anything else just it was about a country man played by anthony the impression i got from this drama will be finally i found the name of the movie i hope i will be able to buy it and this movie worth N ten times i was quite young when i first saw the movie i asked my friends 
 t. made some extremely beautiful films in the but he seems to be a who can not mature with the changing times styles and he 's like stuck with the same old-fashioned are not bad not good either generally acts his two roles of a father and his son but the flawed script often makes him look funny and is good but then she 's always good and here she 's nothing more than such she makes the best of 
 goes all out to touch upon issues and gives the most realistic picture of the modern society one gets the impression of the director even from his earlier movies like and bar the issues just hinted on in the latter movie are and exposed in here the casting is amazing and one can see the on each scene from many mostly the movie leaves you wondering on lots of facts around as you start the things you end up at 
 the thing about this movie is that according to the director it has difficulty finding a distributor in the u.s. because most of them that viewed it could n't the seemingly messages of and american the thought of anyone seeing this as a film in anyway is a minister at a mission with the homeless or wishes someone this makes it a christian movie one could interpret that it is actually for in the land of plenty with all of 
 life begins is a wonderful film some of the best of the era it is set in the ward of a hospital particularly in the room for the women expected to have trouble in it is an older woman a tough mother farrell a young woman an italian woman and the main character young who is spending N years in prison for murder her husband eric is at the hospital at every second to know that everything will be plays 
 i had never heard of this one before the owner of my local rental mentioned it to me being a with the notorious of having been banned in the u.k. i decided to check it out the film turned out be a and ride the sound recording is so poor that dialogue is half of the time the acting gives new meaning to the word what s worse the film follows the tired formula of a of being involved in 
 i must say that during my i 'm quite proud of a lot of the movies i 've the exception being talk about the all time movie in any actor 's resume could you just imagine what 's fired agent must have told her to sign on to this piece of you ever seen that show well they 're making a movie out of it and you get to see germany after that that agent must have star wars a 
 god his eddie in vacation and christmas vacation the show he even made the awful vegas vacation at least worth a will say that he tries hard in this made for tv but that the script is so funny that the movie never really gets anywhere and the rest of the returning vacation including the barron are wasted here even european vacation 's eric idle can not save the show in a brief and sad actually painful to watch christmas 
 being featured at the N film festival and gaining quite some fame this movie appears to be another modern and school drama it 's about a bunch of who get through a and desperate day at school everything 's around a shown at the very beginning to some extent that happens at N the characters are somehow all connected with each other what moves them is described via short interview strictly shot in the characters are well written the acting 
 walking with is absolutely brilliant in every regard kenneth in a way that really makes you want to listen the script for the really sounds as though the researchers and writers had done their it is so and it does get you and never lets go the music is also brilliant very dramatic when it needs to be but the effects and are what makes this work so well the is and the look so real thanks to the simply 
 this is truly a that should never have gotten out of the stable it has two that are acting in entirely different at the top of their game are joan and every of the is in plain sight at the rock bottom are and roberts i can not imagine how and manage to play so well when and roberts are working their every scene she 's in it 's like father knows best in the she 's ann frank light 
 budget limitations time restrictions shooting a script and then cutting it cutting it cutting it this crew is a group of good young in this script yes in effects when time and knowledge is all you have relying on actors and friends and kind others for their time locations and getting a first feature in the can a thing these guys make films good ones check out their collection and see the development and i can working with them is 
 b. really knew how to create a classic and after N decades his western comes across as the real entertaining spectacular in no way a real fan of tv 's i 'll tell you the performances of gary as wild bill and jean as are far more do n't have any giants in hollywood anymore is just one of dozens of from the decade that have seen commercial life decade after decade released all over again like today 's jackson

 is a of the classic the film 's new cooking scene at the beginning of the film is great the are always funny when they cook however after the first few minutes of cooking we cut to original of one thing i noticed about these N to N are that they do fit with the new story they do an shot if the old story line does n't does have a new ending but i wo n't give it away 
 i too am a house party fan house party i is my favorite movie of all times house party N is a to all of the 's and to kid play this was supposed to be part of a series really there was nothing about kid play in this movie or any of the other veterans kid play was probably too old to be throwing a house party movie its kind of focused on but kid play could have at 
 phillips who in her own right has a great list of credits as a hard working hollywood actress in this third installment of and village 's series in this installment the sexual has been down with showing a side a recently this role to the viewers with great ' the action and were the best in the series 
 if it was n't for the bad and script i mean the direction was really in touch with it 's subject the actors were doing good at bringing their characters to life but in the end the thing that was really missing was a solid script to hold all the pieces together i would highly suggest not to watch this unless you 're a al like i am and will watch everything he is playing in even if the result 
 edwards tried very hard to change image in this film he tried to make her not she already was i think they were both still a bit that had not been chosen to film her broadway success of and was passed over as not being enough unfortunately they chose this vehicle to try and this belief it gets to the point where it is almost funny seeing rock hudson who we all know now was every N minutes throughout this 
 i have been away from for the last N years during that time i constantly lived in london when i have seen the movie i how much i am i am not just from turkey i am a part of turkey one of my part is the sound of the the people of the faith thought that he has done great musical but i must say it is more than that it is about putting nice of different approaches politics 
 the film is a bit it 's mostly a silent film with the bulk the story provided through a series of while making a silent film like this is not such a bad idea this is one of those films where the lack of and the early scenes make it simply you do n't understand the reason for the until well into the picture and by then it 's too late the first N minutes of film is something of 
 note these comments are for people who have seen the sky is a brilliant complex and movie that exactly what the says maybe the movie plot can come into focus for confused if one looks at it from a different the following now i have not gone through the film scene by scene so i will have to further examine my and i welcome your thoughts but give this a try and see if the movie does n't fall into 
 i ca n't quite explain why i find this so and the not it may be because the focus here is on all that was great with that film those intimate moments that can so like that film it has a slow pace but this time it is n't it 's the kind of film where nothing happens but minutes passes like that i think that must be due in part to the way the film deals with that act 
 this movie documents a experience for a group of young men and the experience of watching it is in itself for the few movies even to this level of and i can think of no other movie or drama that it there is no other movie in which i have both so much and so much yes it is about and accessible travel on those issues alone it is a venture but it is more it is about friendship it 
 proud to say i 've seen all three fast and the are silly and they might be a little but i love them car and all the beautiful cars and the midnight ill see a fourth know what the difference is between those three and decent acting somewhat thought out plot even if they are and last but not least directors who have a three were made by very competent directors all of them took the films in a different 
 a wealthy young man raised as a son of the must his chinese heritage while living in a white the upon which this film is based is almost certainly a biological and the secret of the plot when revealed at the movie 's conclusion makes all which has it the story still serves up some decent entertainment and good has the title role as the whose life is complicated because he looks keeps the tone of his performance serious throughout 
 the neil simon 's boys walter and george burns is a funny comedy on the strange bond to the life and its but the always bitter taste seeing clark and al lewis burns two big theatrical comedy actors now reduced on the from the hard and old age you can feel only anger and blue not ever surrender and continue to look work while al is tired for players and he is retired to the country in the house to 
 to enjoy this silent comedy short you must suspend concerning the major starting point for the film if you ca n't then you 'll probably be more likely to score this film a lot lower charlie chase has a huge and his wife has a nose large enough to have its own area code unknown to each other they have both been saving to have surgery to correct these defects apparently plastic and surgery was better back in the because 
 now i have seen two movies by the director a very good one my and this bad one the both movies crucial events in chinese history in the century and the first unification of the whole chinese nation in the century with characters convincing sets good acting and an interesting story the fails on nearly every level the sets are great the is good and the few battle scenes are quite exciting but the call me a but too much

 this movie looks like it was made for tv for years i waited for some movie to be made about rubin carter because i loved to see him box at the old and to see this movie was very have of respect for washington but he was awful and is really nothing good to say about this movie except i did like the song 
 for most people N is the film that really is the big for the series it has few fans and most people hate it for it 's commercial approach now i 'm not going to say that N is any good frankly it pretty much but as far as being a properly shot and executed film it this piece of circuit chaos yes the truth of the matter is that N is the worst of two bad and unnecessary to 
 tumbling of and the this was on my want list for quite a while and then i finally scored a copy on a while back it 's never been on and what i got from was a very good quality which i 'm quite satisfied with the movie is i believe the most extreme example of with an emphasis on a woman to an ad for a movie and goes with the producer to a place where it is the 
 this movie is to say the least it 's not good as a comedy and it 's not good as a serious film either the is far too for the former and there is too much for the latter the only come from some of spencer 's reaction shots when he becomes by his brother 's behavior the is excellent but the is 
 this was one of christie 's later stories throughout her long career she was interested in the shifting and the notion of agents both are essentially the same thing and down to questions of who it is that controls or creates the the game is a matter of realities the intends to change reality to fool the the writer intends to do the same to the reader both the reader and the are in similar to create what they see 
 when a entrepreneur is rejected from a prestigious country club he starts a battle between the members and eventually buys it from chevy chase and turns it into a theme course in which everyone can is by no means a good movie but it is still slightly amusing at times almost all of the comedy is cheap and bad jokes except for chevy chase chevy chase plays one of his greatest roles as for a second time and plays it 
 the only reason i remember this movie is because it was and still is the biggest waste of time and money ever spent i was N and my friend was we were the age when action movies were our thing to enjoy most ok most we walked out feeling so we wanted our money back but the time could never be is what killed this movie as the truck gets attacked by more and more vehicles with rocket attached the 
 this movie lacked credibility for two reasons one no mayor of a major city and new york is certainly as major as it gets would allow a borough in his city to into such a violent place to live especially for voters who could have much to say about his or her future job security all of the victims in the movie were mostly elderly jewish or at of age i have never seen a movie that such lack of 
 i just want to start by saying this is the first review of a film i have done on the net i felt the need to warn people about this film because it truly is one of the worst films i have ever seen after reading interviews with the director he says he criticism and so i will try to avoid the film just for the of it and offer my opinions as to why i found it to be 
 i do n't think i 'm too far off base saying that this is possibly the worst movie i 've ever seen i 've been working on a list of my favorite war movies the longest day to hell and back bridge on the river all black and white which all have good rich characters and great acting i 've seen better and acting in high school one act plays the plot however is n't a bad just poorly implemented 
 the film is really good it does n't use violence or sex etc to sell itself like other films but instead just uses a really decent plot based on the original by michael and some great actors to make a fun action packed film which i enjoyed one thing which made me enjoy this film even more was that it had some actors which i really like such as edward norton who i last saw in hour which i enjoyed 
 imagine yourself trapped inside a museum of the dark middle ages and a and his are chasing you where is the last place you want to hide i 'd say inside the virgin of device because there 's a good risk you 'll get to death and yet the elderly lady in this film runs into her the 's is a rather disappointing as director fernando does n't the atmosphere of the but puts the emphasis on situations and no 
 this movie is really special it 's a very beautiful movie which starts with three his brother and their friend they 're poor children 's living on the street but one day they succeeded to steal a bag full of money and then their able to live on to buy a house and their life seems to become much better they 're making new friend but something went wrong and they 're becoming enemies and it all ends up with 
 this is apparently one of 's first with the this his much earlier years with the team but the 's timing is at its best here aside from the intense scenes there are others more but just as funny watch larry when asks him to look at the camera for a or watch the real object prompting 's oh highly is at his and the may look scary but he 's somehow funny he seems as frustrated and with the 
 i 'm a big fan of and movies when you put them together that 's my sweet spot horrible you 're not going to get it in this film is certainly in the form of being and tied naked to various things the is n't very though it did n't register very high on my mainly because none of the were in the least attractive nor did they attempt to act as if they were even threatened they seemed to 
 i was into this series just as surely as the sea would sweep me into its grip although it started out slowly i found that the in the ship the variety of characters and dialogue keep me watching the was to be challenged grow and change on this and i wanted to be there for it i was not disappointed the series took you from humor to tragedy and everything often in the same scene the same breath there was 
 i ca n't even write about the movie i the entire movie it was n't supposed to be funny has no clue what he is doing his story is written it seems without any knowledge of iowa culture and the problem i know is from iowa which makes his movie even more to me why do the two main characters have it does n't make any sense the acting was at best and at times hard to watch violence and 
 someone i know said that there was this film called that was probably up my street i was told about this movie after watching final N and watching the extra feature about near bought the of at the modest price of N pounds got home and watched it and i could not help but and feel good wondering how this film had n't been in my life before the film is about a group of medical students try to see

 it was the navy seal team that the balance from bad movie to just bad up till then there was a lot of bad movie but the they are wearing bicycle painted black you know the ones with air that make every adult who wears them look like a complete tool of course the bass fishing boat they took to the cruise ship might have been another clue it would n't make it across tampa bay let alone an ocean 
 hollywood has out yet another garbage that 's wildly and on a first-time basis is bad terrible and utterly no intended minor follow this movie has huge logic more than any movie or for that matter any movie that the of hollywood it 's a hollywood production designed to cash in on mania directed by director ridley scott and produced by a italian producer with an inflated whose is does n't matter whether film is s money is good ca 
 unlike bond and other movies alfred 's hero used to be a common man who would get into trouble and then with his and and luck would get out of it thief is based on the same principle and so in a way it is 's to the master of the as it may be but it stands its own grounds and as a great director is the story of a common man who one day that he has a 
 sometimes intentionally at other times silly like in the opening scene where a woman is informed that she has been and that her family has been just for the of this film is ultimately neither funny enough nor competent enough as a story to be really i 'll leave you to decide which may be the highlight but the low point is probably the fight with a silly nielsen was a good choice for with her fresh face and her 
 the movie is about paul a young man who into the harsh world of and his stay at the mental hospital and his friends victor who during his education in england started to think he was peter who took to much and tried to fly of a top the fall left no broken or physical damage only he is with china has spent most time at the hospital although is slightly older then him he claims he wrote every single 
 young woman and possibly quite harbors a side which comes to the surface after her father pays her mother a visit asking for a directed by william a. this psychological falls into the trap that most films by directors of photography find themselves in each shot is composed for the style but at the sacrifice of and a tight and his are very of whites and golden giving the picture a feel the mansion at the center of the action 
 i do n't even know where to begin it 's is not worth a review so i will just quote what another user posted because i agree but i give it N N instead of N N i am at a loss to find the words to express how bad i thought this film was the initial was promising but in all it was totally awful let 's run through the main points plot good initial idea but truly terrible 
 what an amazing film with very little dialogue the whole story is told with and body language very involving almost my only is that it has not been released on video in australia and is therefore only available on tv what a waste 
 the is confused that wants so hard to be the evil dead that it even bruce campbell several times the problem is it is simply not in the same league as that movie this movie is nowhere near as original the plot has been used before by kevin in night of the and that was a lot more fun this too much time with complicated before getting the kids into the mansion and starting the is as usual not given 
 ok this movie seems to have been pretty well covered by earlier comments but there are a couple of items i wish to add the mad scientist is producing a from the blood of a animal in order to turn a man into a if we suspend our enough to buy into that fine but the animal in the is a that would make a did audiences in N not know the difference between a wolf and a they 're 
 a at best that deals with not so who discover an evil video game is killing those who die in the game double this movie is the sustained mystery of the mystery gang in i was waiting for them to pull off a of one of the i could deal with this for N minutes even as a movie on but going all the way to the theaters come on people the effects were very this whole scenario is something 
 i just over another comment posted here in which the writer the disturbing ways the in this film use the body of their dead friend one in this statement is perhaps the most of them all no surprise it 's what 's character does he is over one of his friends another friend of his the killer 's girlfriend not because did not like this individual rather he is excited about her death because it gives him something to do 
 this was an movie with flight scenes that were realistic i have seen it multiple times and it has kept my attention throughout every time i myself am a big fan of the air force and love to watch any movie where i can get a of an flying if you like top gun then i guarantee you will love this movie also except for a few mild words this is an excellent movie for the whole family it has 
 is a dangerous she 's beautiful funny and talent dark and i read the other ' on this show as well as the message board stuff and people just do n't get it nothing that appears on is an accident too much money time and work is put into the production of a show for there to be mistakes this show is stupid because wanted it to be stupid this show is because wanted it to be i thought the 
 wealthy horse in have a policy with the of manhattan but what happens when the latin son falls for a certain with bright eyes hair and some moves on the dance floor musical has a glossy yet seems a bit around the it is very heavy on the thin on story an hour replacement for alice gives it a boost even though she 's with don in and hair also good charlotte as 's a driver who 's constantly on 
 tend to fall under the of a low budget and a shooting schedule which is why this film always tends to buck the c. scott perfectly fully all of his cold and still makes him a character the production value for this film was never relying on special effects or yet relying on the and of on-site shooting and strong a movie that certainly stands alone 
 ok so my summary line is a cheap but the movie is full of them and it gets praised so i caught this one on tv as tv here shows all movies that 's for you americans who might say i did n't like it because i saw a cut tv version fortunately that 's only an us thing and had no idea about what it was i switched on caught the last minutes of a show and the movie 
 these guys combine with it 's if you want rent seal or something if you want to see humor and sex this is the think as makes it all she can actually act really well she 's a complete and she does n't seem to feel above it all 
 this movie was recently shown not dubbed on australia 's special broadcasting service i thought i read here that there is sometimes an assumption that of the is a in fact the are getting for something that is done within this movie or in human history there is no as far as i let 's get the of out of the way perhaps this tale crossed my mind when i was watching the film but that 's all there was 
 there is an excellent reason edison went straight to video it would have landed in theaters with a crumbling the movie lasted entirely too long and was boring just a above thanks to freeman and who obviously had a spare two weeks before their next films the bad guys are as and action as near as justin 's acting i hate to knock the guy but the sooner he that pop is his the movie is n't all bad just 
 i remember seeing this movie back when it was released and i still remember the ' i felt when i left the everything about this movie is the music is top and i still play the after all these have seen this movie so many times and yet i still get to watch it again and again nicholas was great and whenever i see in anything i always associate him with this movie it is too bad the rest of 
 i saw the to this film and it looked great so i went out and bought it what a mistake the acting is a the special effects if you could call them that look like something that would n't be out of place at a school play some of the characters are so stupid in this film you will the minute they are on the screen which unfortunately is all to often as for a story forget it this is 
 critics have started calling it the winner club what after berry won it for ball then going straight to the in boys do n't cry and follows it with the core jamie takes a as a pilot in the after a for ray now it 's seems hollywood all over her monster with this one of the worst ever film loses its audience interest after a mere N minutes meaning the only thing really worth staying for is the fact 
 is a comedy that deserves wider recognition especially considering the mainstream that is supposed to us these has already been pointed out this is hardly a real film but rather a sweet that employs the to point fingers while there are necessarily some bloody scenes there is almost no and the way this movie is presented style i ca n't imagine anyone being actually scared or turned off by & his fellow the cast is generally good i felt that 
 this is my first review on and probably first ever written review of a film i 've done of my own accord not for some class i think that fact alone says something about this movie not a good thing i am no journalist or critic though i have seen my fair share of movies but i found this particular film so painful to watch it was necessary for my own peace of mind to about the experience where better 
 look do n't get me wrong i love independent films but come on i could barely sit through it without wanting to kill myself the director had absolutely no talent and he turned something that could have been ok to a f nightmare i am a myself and even the music the acting was am usually a bleeding heart for these low budget films but this one this one did n't even try please do n't waste your precious time 
 folks is a comedy about a man whose parents him to kill them because they 're going and want to be put out of their several times he tries to kill them and then changes his mind saving them from his at the last minute and losing one of his body parts each time in the process the movie seems to hate its main character which makes it all the more painful to watch there 's also the usual and 
 no one goes to a movie like the hills have eyes N and expects the second coming of citizen kane the same is true for the majority of especially those roger has dubbed dead movies the hills have eyes N definitely as a dead movie only here the have been given the appearance of military will argue the line it 's only a movie when questionable facts are raised in a movie review but i 've always been a firm 
 most people will consider that 's greatest performance was as the of in the king and i. certainly it gave him a wide variety of to test his in from comic to from eager to learn to to it also showed him to advantage as a talk singer and a finally as it was also his tony award winning performance from broadway the film allowed us to capture something of the great broadway performance as he did other movies that 
 this movie is wonderful the writing acting all are very and script quality performances by actors ally is strong and dynamic and really original and the scenes are alive with fresh energy and really production 
 if this is the first of the films that you have seen then i strongly urge you to proceed no further the to prove to be no better hard to believe considering this entry is this movie tries but it 's just not worth your time folks take a instead

 i saw this movie years ago on late night television back then it went by the title of to even as a young boy i remember being deeply moved by the story and by the effects of the court trial those who have seen it know what i 'm talking about such a perfect of drama and fantasy this movie is right up there with the greatest ever made citizen kane gone with the wind this movie is rated extremely 
 to say this film is simply a of and a of history is that is not what this film this film is is a comment on the abuses of the church although this could be for any powerful body the ways that this abuse affects people and families and the way so many people choose to simply allow and often participate in the abuse without thinking for themselves the fact that it is the catholic church which is in the 
 great movie about a great man thomas is first rate as in all of his other would never have him as pope john paul it speaks volumes for the casting director why do they keep casting him as german officer in the movies and he only came to universal attention after the of course he looks so hot in the i know a lot of over his face but this guy is a great actor and has such great if 
 this movie is n't worth the film it was on the is flat filled with lines and delivered by actors who sound like their reading a script for the first time the shaky film style is a cheap of the the ring style effects the characters do not even act like a normal person would for example the character who is looking for her sister at her home forces her way through the front door around the house all frightened 
 always present opportunities for dramatic films since in fact most are in themselves dramatic events unfortunately what this film lacks in drama is for by an of one not who wins loses dies or lives just end it as soon as possible this is due in large measure to what seems to me to be a use of background technology scenes of paris and the french have a quality about them they might better be done on a stage and

 despite the feelings of most star wars fans in my opinion return of the is the greatest film ever created ever since the first time i saw it it 's intensity special effects and moving story have me the film was so well put together that it has been able to stand the test of time over the last N years filled with powerful action as the of the original george gives us a finish of the star wars in 
 this short film does n't get there ' and not very funny attempt at dark humor humor is n't funny enough to get you interested and the is n't so you really do n't care about what happens anyway producer spent some money on this and it shows in the production value which is the only saving grace 
 martin seems to be a director who was always interested in social issues as the son of he had every incentive to be so especially since he was in the is based on pat 's novel the water is wide about his own experience in N teaching a school of black children about the outside world much to the of the what added to the movie 's strength was the cultural and historical context jon tells another teacher how many 
 the best thing i can say about is that it 's not quite as bad as i remembered it being on my first that does n't mean it 's weird is not quite like any other movie i 've ever seen which i guess at least gives it the of but it 's a disaster of a movie and one of the worst robert altman ever made on the special feature about the making of it 's clear that even 
 there is no need for me to repeat the by glenn the black and white is even more powerful in portraying the of country village life at that time the deep measure of friendship shown by toward the two elderly the heart the supporting cast is excellent and their performances it would not be fair to single out any one character since the entire story depends on the cast as a whole i can not put my finger exactly on 
 the worst part of all is the poor leading to ' character is intensely and and himself has the face to hunter 's character is and hunter herself in serious as johnson was wooden john goodman made the best of the whole death ghost thing has since been somewhat and now appears rather barely only if you like old 
 a truly film while rick baker 's special effects are quite impressive if it has no other features like many movies it leaves you feeling as if you need to take a long and the off of yourself the characters are and plot makes no sense 
 let me coin a new word here the fear of relationships this is yet another in a long line of movies which start out by audiences about some kind of only to turn on a and go all about how it is oh so necessary and the only moral thing to find a solution only one person in a thousand understands the of being able to love more than one person and this director is not one of them my 
 terrible use of scene cuts all is lost either by awful or direction that robot been a jazz also one of the worst sound tracks i 've ever heard usually out by music and where 'd they get their that ship looks like a milk i did better special effects on at the age of N i 'd recommend any film student should watch this N minutes at a time so as to learn how not to produce a film 
 this movie has no respect for the 's time it takes a N minute story and it into N minutes in order to achieve this they have to use a very slow and have everyone run around with some by the time this movie showed anything interesting in the plot i just did n't care the problem is not in the acting but instead the the story is just weak jim is a capable actor but his attempts to light 
 since i 'd bought the i watched as much of this as i did out of a sense of obligation to my plot has kirk douglas as a successful first novelist who hired day as a secretary falls in love and her is usually thought of as an intense actor given to heavily dramatic roles sometimes hero sometimes he 's not bad in this comic part the problem is that the part is n't particularly comic and neither is anything 
 no features this film is its jokes do n't begin to be funny the for children is and the attempts to appeal to adults just add a to the whole package sitting through it with my children just made me uncomfortable about what might be coming next i could n't enjoy the film at all although my child for whom the was bought enjoyed the fact that she owned a new neither she nor her expressed much interest in seeing

 this is an film about the search for some in everyday life the the camera work the the musical score and the pure of this picture make it a must see it is n't easily by the or the only flaw i can see about this film is that it was n't captured in a more technically perfect film format it and the very sound format available an intimate film can be made in the italian effect on its would 
 what the hell was all that about i saw the and was it was the most spectacular movie ever made what ever the brothers to do this film is beyond is no plot you ca n't argue with that basically all this film was was a load of talking and do n't get me wrong i have no problem with films but all the talking in the was a load of then there would be a fight which lasted way

 few movies have dashed expectations and upset me as much as fire has the movie is garbage it does not achieve anything at an artistic level the only thing it managed to receive is a ban in india if only it was because of the poor quality of film making rather than the controversy the ban would have been more that i 've got my out of my system i am more able to the movie from the the movie

 despite a few acceptable of the books ' main themes queen of the did not stay true to anne 's complicated story telling the deep that build up all the characters were apart to only their surface if not a completely different identity the order of the major events in the movie seemed and there were quite a few things the movie did to deserve my rating of one was that the film strongly captured the affect that among other 
 please note that i have n't seen the film since i discovered it in N and my town is smaller and does n't carry it however i really want to say something about it i 'm actually doing research for university on the title character richard maurice and would like to point out that the person they based the main character on was in reality completely different hollywood 's ideas of people and artistic license granted the real dr. totally 
 this film speaks a universal language one can it to the community society or the wider world it has a way of not only opening up several questions but also setting one in pursuit of and asking the right questions in order to get to that point of conviction ownership the portrayal of the within the film addresses the around us which must be as being the cycle of destruction the opposing force of innovation creativity and growth the factors 
 this is by far the worst movie i 've ever seen the acting is wooden the are simply stupid and the story is totally it 's not even scary N out of N from me 
 there are no reasons of taking this serious and there are four reasons for that N the people who made this including the director and the producer are or of therefore the criteria of fails for instance they mentioned that the the so called played a huge part in the fall of but they did n't mention that there were equal organizations as well for you who are n't that familiar with history the so called that were portrayed in

 the for parts of the movie were very beautiful and the photography get all my votes and that 's about the extent of my for this movie i found that all the characters were found so often in the american culture and were and susan and are easy to look at but i found their characters very and for many other reasons when at a party it made me wonder how this woman could think of herself as a competent 
 i thought i 'd every the had to offer but the combination pull off some genuine and surprises here thanks to the direction by the atmospheric photography by lee plus sharp film and special effects brilliant acting helps too gives one of his most convincing performances as the the sort of character he was to repeat in other roles such as york miss center in her first major role is also an the principals receive great support from paul and 
 it s funny how warns you of something for example as soon as the company credits read image i knew i d seen a really film by them somewhere before but remember where nevertheless i just knew judge and jury was going to be and it was maybe i mild the opening is rather violent with several people getting away for no more reason than being in the wrong place at the wrong time i don know about you but 
 have to say puts on a better performance then did in but to say this film it just makes me so much mainly because the actors seem really into what their doing and you just sit there and thinking the hell are they on ' but in a very very very very good random of were brilliant and well and the musical score used i really really casting and as said before everyone seemed so into their from me unlike 
 this is n't as violent as i was expecting which makes the violent scenes appear all the more and are a lot of and turns and back and double crossing all the way through the film making it hard to know who 's side a particular character is plot is with some good dialogue and character development and gives an interesting view of the workings of the gang it violence when it comes is no guns or art scenes with 
 i first saw love in limbo playing late on free to air tv about five years ago and since then it 's a movie i 'll always remember as one of those films you see and are forever influenced the australian film has a long history of making about losers and love in limbo is a sterling example of this is the only name actor in it although these days he 's all a movie needs the rest of the 
 may contain i had very high expectations for this film based on the i knew a bit about the real ed so i figured this was a hollywood version of the real events man was i the writing apparently came from an who barely knew anything about ed 's history and out the script in about N minutes the movie completely passes over the most interesting of ed and his relationship with his mother not to mention what the real 
 i am normally not to write a review for a film but the only commentary for this film thus far on is rather unfair so i feel it necessary to share my point of view or as it was titled at the theater i saw it fallen follows a as he tries to learn about a woman whom he did n't try to stop from jumping off a bridge as well as her reasons for doing so that 's the 
 watching this but very entertaining career girl tale i was by joan 's first appearance all i could think initially was my god it 's the same face as michael jackson in his notorious photo about N minutes into the movie baker and hope get out of a in greenwich village as they walk down the street you can see part of a sign in back of them for the bar scene of the that are considered the trigger for 
 movie if you did not watch yet you must watch davis and samuel l. jackson are amazing in this actors good story incredible action scenes > the long i give it a N N stars 
 this film is so awful it is funny not quite to N levels of but funny nonetheless the acting is awful the music is and the story does not make a blind bit of sense the story around a man dressed in an awful killing a bunch of people at a party the death scenes are so badly done they are one girl is repeatedly in the but does not try or defend or or run away she also manages 
 i had never paid much attention to this until i learned that author of the brilliant network was the his work there had instructed me as to his so when ' appeared on i was anxious to see it i was not disappointed looking at both this film and network it would seem that his big theme is the and sheer of large human enterprises hospitals networks against the of individual experience and the human spirit and all of it 
 new orleans is nothing like how it is portrayed in of a film 's attempt at speaking with a by the way hardly anyone speaks that way in is terrible plot and to itself as a mystery but a mystery involves process a is given clues and throughout a film there 's none of that here tries to get by on new orleans do n't be the real big easy is nothing like the & their way through 
 in his grave if there was any film that upon a man 's life work its this one the lead character 's lone wolf is and and the script was apparently written by a with an eight grade education whoever 's idea this was should be horse the only reason i 'm spending time it is because there 's a N line minimum 's family should sue not because its but because now it 's as by shame i blame 
 i do not believe all the for this movie the play and movie were a of michael wishes he were and wishes he were even had the to do a of with law playing his original part law you mean the one that did the of this movie was made during a period of 's career when it was obvious he needed to pay off gambling debts he would do anything for money he would star in such award winning

 i have to admit that i 'm a great fan of this show so you must know how disappointed i got when i watched this movie first of all the plot was awful i thought it was going to be something more interesting like to see what happened to arnold or something more interesting but a wants to destroy arnold 's house between many other places so many people tries to stop must admit that the plot was n't so 
 the war in the east as the germans referred to the conflict was a war of on the part of the germany N of the german army were in the soviet union fighting their ultimate aim was to wipe out the so called human russian population and the mainly empty country with german after they had 's willing here we have the german army presented as innocent victims and not as mass when are modern german film makers going to 
 i did n't understand the people who rated it over i think it 's a horrible film from any point of view acting art music i do n't mind a low budget however you have to get some point wondering then two boys started in bed awful awful i love films do n't mind it is slow however this movie disappointed me from any even the not was wondering what kind of people would like it i am a female 
 i gave this show a chance because of white not for his character but mainly for the the voice so anyway like i said i gave it a chance and i was very of it i never for the character so i was pleased to see mr. white in a role other than the and his j. first called but come the second episode everyone started calling him was very entertaining and think my favorite episode was when was dating 
 i believe i received this film when i was a young buck i remembered watching it as a child but i could never find the film i remembered good ann andy the greedy king i searched high and low for this movie and still no luck but one day when i was moving out of my home i had found it we were i am N years old now i still watch it all the time actually it 's one

 i really wanted to like this movie the looked marginally funny but i figured they put most of the funny stuff in the in this case they not only did that but they the so that they appeared much than they were in the real film i like john the rock the etc so i wanted to like this movie but it just never seemed to do saw get and did not particularly care for it too slow and for 
 i think this was the most outstanding that i have seen in a long time the research for the film was the writer kelly has left no loose ends the cast was performances all round was is music and the overall effect highly goes into territory that even the media fears to it is really a call for those involved with and the legal that is the war on a woman walked out of the theater and asked me does 
 in my opinion the best movie ever i love when people ask me what this film is about i usually and say life they and probably never give it another thought the fact that everyone from every background can to some part of this movie makes it all that much more amazing a must see for everyone 
 go fish rose or the reputation of a film maker with much then hard to understand how she could turn out a movie made up of that one associates with the entire film i the whole way supposed to be a look into human well not much more here to be learned than from in and out by now most of us actually do know that there are men who are attracted to women and there men who are attracted 
 every generation fully believes it is living in the end times this has been true for thousands of years now and movies like this feed on this how did they get the great to this train this is a about the of it tries to link the as well as it can to what was happening in the times it was made making it obviously dated and kind of look like they are out of but without the high production 
 a film that leaves you someone had it more i would have thought that the story of the creation of las vegas would prove interesting but it fails at almost every turn warren 's performance as the stupid and leaves you you were watching someone else once or twice he through the of his performance to deliver an interesting scene but most of the time you just ca n't care about him gives a skilled turn as his but even 
 is another mainstream film by john waters done on a smaller than serial mom the title character of has a of taking pictures of anything he sees it does n't matter if it 's or when he takes pictures he soon uses the pictures he taken and puts them on display at his work live in a middle-class family his works at a drinking bar with a machine but does n't make enough money with a bar across the street

 this was a doomed from its conception the very idea of it was take a minor character from a film and make a complete while changing its tone to a family movie i was n't the least bit interested then came the not only did it only confirm that the film would be and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and i 'm not every moment every plot point every joke is told in the 
 do not bother to waste your money on this movie do not even go into your car and think that you might see this movie if any others do not appeal to you if you must see a movie this weekend go see batman script was horrible perfectly written from the random movie format given a place in confined a with various weapons a man who manages to all of the clues that honest police officers can not put together

 if the following sounds then by all means rush down to your local blockbuster and rent this movie awful N 's from to the worst child actor in the world ever who does nothing but cry and say in the most voice lots of stock of and that does n't with the film at indians who use and talk oh and it goes without saying they around a fake plane crash where the cast actually throw themselves into the corners 
 lost is largely considered one of the most beautiful tv series that have never done and so is if you of and this is the series for you in the first season since the first episode starts to go increasingly to move forward until you get to the second season in the second you lose a little its of mystery and expectation and very on and reveal the various that the island the third season is perhaps the second most 
 from the critical i expected more from this movie and from the story just along and did n't seem to have a point or a plot and i find it hard to believe that a N year old girl mature for her age or no would be so about getting the loss of her over with maybe i am too young to i was four years old in N but i did n't have any problems connecting with the stories 
 director douglas once said there 's a very short distance between high art and trash and trash that contains is by this very quality to art ' this statement his perfectly a very unique body of work that includes classic stage and war films and of course his famous 's were as the very word with music the music sets the tone for his style and every of his was also a leaves a powerful image on the but this

 i can the writers of this story thinking up this script 's make a serial killer movie like knight moves and of the people like serial killer stuff it 'll sell killer needs to adopt some sort of pattern i know he 'll copy it out of a serial killer mystery novel that has n't been done yet at least not exactly like that we need some kind of way to make this movie unique of course the good guy 
 rod was of course a and his wonderful creative mind left something of the period in which he lived and examples of television at that state of development there are no such shows now but rather or or the at humor and that our high-tech edged into the episode with such acting precision and with his usual that i ca n't help but think that rod was that long ago week 's show around even though he was an to 
 who would think andy 's had a steve movie in her past but that is only one of several weird and wonderful things about the ultimate movie which might best be described as rebel without a cause meets god knows what from outer space the rebel is steven who would shortly decide that steve sounded less a good boy with just enough wild to be interesting the very yet understanding girlfriend is the it was bad enough when their date

 this movie is a real it was exciting from shortly after the start till the very end if you are a real this is the movie for you the characters were very well developed and the was beautiful the story was very well written similar to some others i have seen but quite different in several ways a must see 
 this series takes a classic story and makes of it robin is somehow by an in the forest and is in all sorts of and outright episodes the story is more about him avoiding the evil than helping the poor this is barely and to top all the they kill robin at the end of series N and replace him with another actor some people may like this show as a fantasy show but it is not a robin show

 i had a great time watching femina a couple of back somewhat for most of the film its pretty much a two showing the games and weird relationship of crazy doctor and stunning i 'd seen her before in a couple of films dying deaths but here she is young and beautiful the film is pretty predictable and certainly mild on the front but entertaining throughout too its feel the set design music lighting and are all classic late italian 
 this written by steve martin himself is so bad it makes you sick to your the plot is the acting awful and the dialogue is even more predictable than the at all costs 
 for an evening of pleasure and cheap special effects lines its the original N movie starting land as peter and jacobson as martin and directed by al movie is about an evil ancient spirit that a at a hospital then she starts killing doctors one by acting was but some of the acting was was good but the sex scenes were just thrown in there probably to get more was bad and the special effects looked like a drawing the 
 telling the story would n't be the point at all would it almost like is the title for that brilliant novel of the late that shocked a lot of people including 's island is the title and what an island in the book the main character has the world record book as his own and he 's keen on breaking new records himself in particular the youngest person under water for three story is as most swedish films and books

 the first film i had to walk out on and it was the cast and crew not that i was involved i to add i made it through the first hour so i i 'm just qualified to comment but that was my other comments here how did this get through any kind of an accumulation of the very worst in dialogue the of wooden acting awful casting all together without a 's casting was bizarre almost comic she the 
 this is one of the more episodes of the zone with some fun and amusing characters to break the tension of some moments there 's the usual what is up with 's for that kind of character such that she keeps showing up in various episodes and other characters but it 's jack 's old man who totally the show i consider this the funny version of the are due on street or perhaps a zone of the thing on

 one of my favorite movies of all times have seen it three times already it does a great job of up the walks of life israeli humor and and much of the problems go through universal theme of wanting to be accepted and be accepted for who you are good humor and it 's the of the characters that makes this movie magic and says a lot about culture and the and humor with a great actor in it cohen

 i do n't doubt that victor won his best actor for this film by of a three way split among the on the leads of clark charles and tone who were all in the same race but the is still a fine film because john ford would n't have gotten his first best director if it was n't no split involved in his movie and the story by that it is based on involves a poor of a man named

 so what a real independent film in a day and age where the latest fad of mainstream hollywood is to appear and cutting edge i 'm sorry to say that what the general public tends to as independent film is usually nothing more than a marketing is why we should be glad that films like of a minute exist across the board this film makes a point out of its own film love it or hate it is n't afraid 
 this first time comes across as a season pro with two most action are all about the action first then the story but this picture works the other way around if this is just the beginning for this director then hollywood will soon be making room for this rising star independent movie making has once again reached a new level

 i can not believe anyone is giving this film a good rating in addition to the terrible acting thin plot line and pace this would be the movie to watch if you were really trying to fall the writer 's and director 's brains must have been fried eggs to ever have something as as this based on the plot summary on the case the really sounded promising but within the first ten minutes i knew it was a lost

 to get in touch with the beauty of this film pay close attention to the sound track not only the music but the way all sounds help to the how the opening scene leading to the of the theme of moral note the way music the characters as we are led inside 's marriage do n't expect to find much here of the political life of italy in that 's not what this is about on the other hand if 
 i was expecting this to be just like the others tries to be ends up looking silly somewhere along the line the writers must have this and so took the film in a totally different direction basically ignoring the other films this feels like a different film rather than the fourth entry in the child 's play series the new idea works making this the best in the series by far

 this is a film that i love above all others i try to the main film locations in and whenever i can which help to those that this film seems to so a and more age with its that people really do matter that family life is not just another disposable and that life really is worth living though sometimes we may doubt that in short a film that soon brings to my eyes helped perhaps by the deeply music

 what can i say about the pleasure planet that i haven said about other soft core films very little it s just another movie with a very weak plot used to set up very set scenes between male actors who spend too much time in the and who have obviously had silicon actually the sex scenes in this movie are somewhat less convincing than you usually see in this type of film as the cast members their together giving like 
 i loved this film at first the graphics seemed odd with the but i quickly got into it there must have been thousands of hours of shot and i really the work done in cutting it down if you 're easily shocked by drugs or violence it might not be the film for you but there are some great characters here and some real technically i liked it a lot too they must have used a new or maybe it 
 i sometimes grow of reading reviews of some of 's lesser known films because almost every single one starts out with someone saying this film is grossly or this is a hidden or a true great or some other generic if only people would watch this they would see that this is a great film just as much as north by northwest rear window etc so that being said i would just like to say that if only people would 
 you know robin williams god him is constantly shooting himself in the foot lately with all these he has done this decade with perhaps the exception of death to which when it came out but is now a classic the he has made lately have been especially and one hour photo the night despite reviews and a quick release is among his best work is a very story even though it does n't include a serial killer or anyone that 
 the first film is somewhat good to me i enjoyed it for the most part but i thought it was really nothing all that special however when compared to this mess it looks a whole of a lot better why they felt the need to make the movie is beyond me but they should have known it could not match the acting of the first movie when they only could get ruth gordon back to her role the story kind 
 this movie is like with all of the good parts removed it 's like all of the stars that did n't want to fulfill their obligations together around this awful piece of is a helpful movie if you 're in the mood to a loved or no longer loved one it 's important that if you choose to use this movie as a method of that you put in and put on a to keep yourself from going i had 
 i saw this movie just recently and i said to myself this movie is bad william is a great actor but he is no director it 's not just that the acting is bad it 's terrible and instead of a plot we have a very bad that is called a plot what i really thought was bad was at the beginning where kirk and were teaching how to row row row your boat do i have something against william 
 i ca n't this film enough it had a lot of that hand-held shaking camera which i love and some hate because it makes them sick like and blair is a long movie for its kind but i did n't even notice because the film was so interesting by just showing the from a reporter 's work the movie keeps up the pace making it a experience for the i would never call this film the ever made i 'd 
 i wanted to see this movie ever since it was first advertised on tv i went to town to see it last night at N i regret the day that wasted my ticket on this trash when i could of saw something better the beginning was all a bunch sex trash and they the way love works in reality all of the were stereo types the was too stupid for his own age the passing that the pregnant girl kept 
 having seen the hot in the pretty good wrong turn i decided to pick this one up instead of return of the living dead of all movies have n't seen that one yet but considering it is one of the most highly movies ever safe to say i made the wrong choice there is simply nothing to recommend this movie and i am talking about the supposedly superior killer cut it did n't even have the sex appeal of to 
 the movie itself is not too bad many comments have pointed out the obvious flaws of the script but it is what really gives me the though is that people like justin even get cast for movies and on top of that for movies like this one i have to admit i had never heard the man 's name before watching this but the very instant he appeared i was just plain the voice is the face is a bad 
 recently released on british this is a good movie as long as you have an attention span and of more than a fruit fly not as as it could have been this is at its most is great in it the music is sweet carol white is very as the single who ca n't stop scene is where carol and her friend who works in the with her the one with the enormous which comes down over one eye sit 
 with ralph most of his films appear to be like you 'll get something out of it but only if you put up with the silly and the the lord of the was a great of the story which perhaps did n't always in the and ice is a great achievement from from an point of view the is a lot more detailed and the has a look to it you still get some of the and slightly background paintings 
 's first feature is an of james m. 's the always twice now i 'm not familiar with that book or the other film versions but i am a big fan of 's double much more so than i am a fan of wilder 's film version of it in fact the two seem like they must be very similar both involve an love affair where a wife complains to a morally weak man that her husband is and mean 
 radio was not a N hour a week happening when i grew up in the england so children 's hour was a treat for me when we had and an to spare for the power the few i heard therefore made a great impression on my young mind and the N that i recall still are one about all the animals at the and grey talking about the animals he knew which he called his brothers it was only in 
 this is undoubtedly one of the movies ever made as a country is the best thing is the never stops the plot is a story where child is from mother who everything for her duty with a happy at the end there are and there are brothers and there are and there are and there is a blind brother and a thrown in for good measure but this movie is about and all you remember at then comes to the 
 rudolph 's film from N is given a for the N 's cornell dennis is a university who used to have a successful writing career but now gone down the along with his marriage the initial plants the notion in the viewers mind that everybody has something against him so when the comes that he has been we are not that surprised unless of course you are familiar with the original after being told he has less than to live 
 is one of those movies that you will want to see over and over again michael is put in charge of wooing a japanese car company to come to his town thus creating jobs for the residents of what happens after that is one moment after another the two clash and it is up to to hold things together look for great performances from george rogers john and all are perfectly cast do n't be by the low number rating 
 i agree in many parts with the fairly review already posted on the subject of the and agree that it does have its pros not only its for example the original film manage to much of the middle and final sections of the novel into a single including the discovery of and the love affair of paul and which on reading the novel is a probably born of the studio cutting of which the other writes this was one of 
 i love the novel on which this film is based and while this modern version of sharp 's story is a b film the casting of in her first role is rather became mgm 's good girl in scores of and comic roles she was an actress fair was 's film to in which she played a and greedy daughter who almost the loyal 's is much than hopkins ' version N years later in sharp 's is very much 
 the represents the of b. at its most inaccurate and it sets up parallel for no less an than wild bill gary bill james jean arthur george armstrong and lincoln to even though in reality lincoln was already dead at the time the story takes place every once in a while close toward the truth but just as easily away from it into and the film is an attempt to 's last stand with a of that is only based 
 in spite of its impressive cast and crew man early and often the plot is the actors sport bad and director robert altman 's participation amounts to collecting a pay check once again he has assembled an impressive cast like allen everyone wants to work with altman that this time around to the letter is but that 's only part of the is rick a high georgia lawyer who in the film 's heavy handed opening scenes manages to get 
 at first i was n't sure if i wanted to watch this movie when it came up on my guide so i looked it up on and thought the cover looked pretty cool so i thought i would give it a try expecting a movie like i got past the fact that i am supposed to dislike the character played by busy phillips i realized what a good job this movie was doing toward setting up the relationship between and 
 the films ' producers are hoping that ' name will help sell this picture unfortunately nothing can save what has already been captured on the screen despite some shot european locations and some solid production design elements the film fails mostly due to its between and an experience 
 i got this as part of a competition prize i watched it not really expecting much from an obviously low budget production i myself sick there are obvious to other films in the texas chain saw massacre friday etc all the standard were there long drive through partially and somehow vehicles tracking you throw in some really good scenes from the and dialogue f virgin that 's got to be an and you have one of the best films for

 is a bad movie and deserves it reputation as an funny film it takes a serious subject and presents it like the notes version or classic because there is n't much or a proper just segments together with mostly stupid true stories by a variety of is a film as it is poorly written and acted however what i have found most interesting about the film is its apparent instead of and working a communist cuba they seem to be 
 well i do n't personally like but i still found fear of a black hat i 'm sure i did n't get some inside jokes but some i knew and it was funny enough to make me just after i 'd stopped laughing i 'm a big fan of tap so naturally i had to check this out it was from this is tap sometimes but this film still stood on it 's own as an original and funny my 
 the release of this movie hopes you will buy this movie on the name and face of bullock her picture from years after this film basically is the cover art and the back cover art and the inside cover art the same picture her name is shown on the front cover all N and the disk itself she is the first name in the list of stars her is printed inside the case this film must around her character right 
 although kurt russell was and is probably the person to look like in so many things were false in this film first of all the makers claimed opened his famous live shows in after a N year for films by wearing a white made in also they claimed he sang love ' which he first sung in N and wonder of you ' which he first recorded in they also claim that he got his first for christmas when all 
 whatever it 's the with seriously the the girl from the big monster and to himself as her ' the lead actor does a pretty good job of there 's a massacre in a police the bad guy is with red eyes and it even contains dialogue along the lines of you said it yourself he wo n't ever stop never the dire script comes from a first-time who god has n't sold anything since this and it 's all 
 this episode apparently grew out of the cold war there has been a but somehow elizabeth montgomery and charles have come through it then becomes a battle for turf she is attracted to him and vice but the for survival takes over it 's a quiet slow moving battle as they attempt to achieve trust they come to but takes over and they start again of course the male female role of the comes into play and modern viewers might 
 right away this film was ridiculous not that it did n't have aspects for example the best thing about this film was the beautiful background anyone not living on the east coast should know the south does n't have beautiful like those found in the west i knew it was utah right off the bat but perhaps could n't his english so they had to excuse it by saying this was a southern town his into a southern one was

 in the hands of lesser actors than and robert this film could have become silly and but with these two experienced leading the way i found silent to be a most exciting and little mystery when their is interrupted by a who claims that is already married and that he was best man at that one can sense that there is some sort of plot against her at work as and her attorney set out to the claim of a

 i give this movie N out of N because the were interesting in their roles and the unknown creates an interesting guess who game the movie however needs more robin in it he appeared in the movie in the beginning and throughout the rest i always thought the new series did little justice to the neat new robin character let alone this movie just continues that bad tradition the movie spends too much time on bruce wayne and his which 
 sorry to say i have no idea what hollywood is doing sure give us movies like batman begins oh by the way hollywood i think they may cover the story line in the movie batman but please do n't us what we would really want to see batman and together i really this because it left me wanting for more i was looking around to see when it was coming out it was like a terrible practical joke the graphics 
 for anyone who liked the series this movie will be something to watch however it also leaves you wanting more i loved the way that every character made an appearance least with the ending of who is the fourth chair for they leave a reason for another movie my guess is of course this like the series was a very well put together series of scenes this is a series i wish had lived on thanks to the cast for 
 i have to say that i know the of and so i knew that i will get a very well made piece of movie i was not disappointed as a history i did saw hundreds of and liked the different approach of this director and his N consultants veteran families tried to access the reality of the through the letters of from both sides so the history is followed by british australian and is this by and sam both boost 
 's creation is a great example of how not to make a movie first there was a book written with a great humor book that has numerous fans who would be happy to supply help when producers for some reasons decided to employ people who hardly heard of the book in the first place then came a script as and full of nonsense as possible at the same time the script was written in a way to allow only those

 this is unlike any other movie the thing i can compare it to is a allen film but where as allen is constantly human carr appears to be trying to figure out a way to get to with that one that tends to define us for better or worse in the case of it is the root cause of his which can be back to a child that is revealed through are so many people in the world and i 
 this movie looked like a classic in the which is my favorite of them all so when i saw it was free on demand i had to watch it it stars from both dr. films she was his wife that died N the golden of hunter the spy who loved me and to you by the people behind do n't open christmas and pieces my thoughts on this it opens on april day where a bunch of kids play an 
 rating rating N and rating h. macy a stunning performance as the role of mr. he makes you feel sympathetic and scared for him the story starts out as a comedy and slowly but steadily becomes almost like a film with and turns that macy masters i could n't take my eyes off this film even after it ended and i could n't it ended when it did a must to may be considered a by you watch the film 
 classic N 's sex trash the swedish was what made this movie so great she was beautiful but what really got to me was how sexual she was she massive quantities of throughout the film her best scenes were when she was herself whenever she was on screen i became the doctor sister of the male focus of the film was very interesting although most N year old have bigger than she knew how to use what little she had

 i 'd really have to rate sex is comedy as one of the worst pieces of i have ever seen the film those which are the worst aspects of the french or at least how they are and i myself am and feel slightly that the of this film are from the same culture as me that should give you an idea as to how bad this movie really was one does n't so much watch this film as to 
 the first time i ever saw this movie was back in the as a my actually recorded it off the tv i must have watched is over N times before the relatively recent release on of course bought and watched the and was taken by how much the dialogue had changed in the first version which i still have on the mood of the film thanks to the dialogue was actually very dark however the new version featuring van al

 this film is truly a work of art i went into the at the convention in indiana with very low expectations having already viewed N other film with in the title both of which were so bad that by the end of the second one i had out one of my own eyes with my drinking and a paper i found between the seat but from the opening credits had me the northwest setting made a beautiful backdrop for the 
 james j. champion of the world from N to N turned out to be 's favorite role possibly because he did n't have to a or be in a western he grew tired of the and he said in his that he felt he was in and could n't understand why people liked him in them it is an film but hardly does tell the real story of james j. portrayed was the first scientific to win in the division 
 it makes sense to me that this film is getting from hollywood because in hollywood it 's all just a popularity contest it also makes sense when you think that people who are the film may just be reacting to the being out at you rather than story content yet this film is and eddie murphy looks just ridiculous no way do hudson and give the rated performance so many have over before the film was even out i ca 
 this has to be one of my movies of all time the dialogue with the constant use of is very tight the cast are and the plot is highly n't take my word for it watch this movie and enjoy it for yourself 
 warning tons of dead do n't read if you have n't seen this series or you can 're are few words to describe a movie that claims to be the last and comes out with another maybe even some words that ca n't be but when street N 's dead shows everyone who thought the series got old and wanted to stop seeing him or people who wanted their hero or just stops for his final breath this film was 
 the best scene of the people across the lake is the featuring a house a murder & a lake after that it 's pretty much from there on as far as the is concerned a family mom sister & younger brother is fed up with the mildly dangerous environment of and decides to go and live near the lake from then on the film features too much happy near the lake with occasionally some up here and there the couple 
 i 'm sorry but for a movie that has been so as a classic and a scary movie but seriously i think when the director has me laughing that 's not a good thing the characters in this film were just so over the top and i just could n't stop laughing at 's voice it was just like a high pitched girl 's british voice not to mention 's over dramatic stick up his of the corn is about 
 i saw this movie on the film festival of jan and followed the discussion between director and public many people reacted shocked and he will get a lot of negative critics but the world is like this and it 's not funny people do n't like it that itself does n't mean that the movie is bad i can see that difference do n't shoot the that shows us the world outside our ' nevertheless i think this a bad

 is the more extreme british version of in which the four boys and go to great to hurt and each other the reason this show is better than is because most of the are not planned which makes the reaction much more funny there are N series of the show the first follows them around and takes a long look at their lives there 's an episode on their love lives jobs etc the second series sends the boys to 
 the were so funny that i could n't wait to see this movie i just got home and i have to say i could n't have been more embarrassed at this movie yes there were times where the jokes were funny but the roles were painful joan is a fine actress but the scene with the was just in poor taste to say the were few and far between in the movie house for a largely white crowd i was 
 i was interested to see the move thinking that it might be a diamond in the rough but the only thing i found was bad writing horrible the shot do not flow even though the director might say that that is what he is going for it looks very and the could have been done by anyone with N and the stock was low budget video i would say that it was n't even something as simple as digital video 
 well i 'll begin with this i love not even the worst plot or the most terrible acting will the experience as long as there is a certain amount of and present second this is the worst movie of all times it even mean guns and the attack of the killer and for that i pay it the humor was only funny until half the movie had passed after which point everything was so so sad to my great surprise 
 no yes i watched this entire train but only so that i would n't later wonder if had come to his in the latter part no he had not this may be historically interesting to you youngsters out there to see that british humor included black jokes like these years ago what me even more though is to read the other ' comments which acknowledge this is n't very good yet then turn around and give it high votes if 
 this movie was terrible you could n't fast forward fast enough to get to the end of this movie it came down to the last N minutes of the film and i literally hit the right in the middle of the scene it was one of the worst movies i have ever experienced worse than all dean films combined to start the acting was terrible i realize that the main actors were from the cast of but one would think 
 bruce one of 's best pictures since well a long time it contains one of the scenes i have seen for a long time too morgan freeman plays god well and even chips in a few jokes that are surprisingly funny it contains one or two romantic moments that are a bit boring but over all a great movie with some funny scenes the best scene in it is where jim is up the man 's rating 
 this film had me this evening thanks to fox movie for showing it john this cast of little known black and most of all the children made this a worthy way to spend a sunday evening how wonderful to see the early work of this actor as well as paul 's excellent portrayal of mad i ca n't see why anyone would say that is in the role as who would they have chosen the character actor charles lane although 
 david even before i knew what this film was about these names were enough to draw me in and popular these are performers to look out where do i start we already know what the film is about five beautiful being targeted by a ' serial a guy they all turned down at the school dance N years ago his include as cards and a bleeding nose his weapon of choice well take a pick electric and arrow hot iron 
 after some i found the series on at before anyone gets excited the set i received was burned by an from home video tapes recorded off of their tv N years ago the resolution and quality are poor the images look like you would expect old video to look although the commercials were out the ending credits of each episode still have announcements for the into the abc news program complete with the top news from the early N 's 
 starting with a and images of american missiles children and i quickly that this was not going to be a objective N convicted after the are interviewed and give a very confused why they had to trash the and then oh my god actually have pay for what they have done i kept watching and many questions are raised were the trial properly done and did the have the right to do what they did lots of questions asked and 
 this little film is full of about british tea and american gun culture and marriage yet it manages to be sensitive to the issues surrounding each bates is amazing grace and as a character actor of staggering range she brings her considerable talent to ground this somewhat unusual film as she did in fried green with the help of other like dan as max her husband and the backdrop of downtown chicago and rural england the story is just intriguing 
 what an ambitious project kenneth here and how well it was realized this is the first version of ' to use the full text of shakespeare 's play but did n't do it just because it was there his intention i believe was to make the play accessible and to the general without it down so to speak in return he asks viewers to put in a little work themselves a fair enough proposition and one that 's a setting 
 i really liked this film one of those rare films that hollywood really does not make anymore william macy is just great as the hit man with a soul and campbell is just flat out as the woman who puts his life on the track of you have a chance see this film it earns it 's 
 bobby is a kid who far too much and wants sex so he buys a van to aid in this the acting is the comedy is and the script is no more than a chain of and cheap the makers of the film obviously wanted to capture some of the out there of other films of the time but fell a long way short they even resort to bobby slipping on a skin because this will supposedly add 'm struggling 
 this movie was unfortunately dialogue and acting make it almost is is a reason judge 's career has you do n't live in new york and are n't jewish several of the jokes will be too found the need to have the daughter go straight at the end quite simply can not how this film was so popular at film is without a doubt one of the worst films i have seen in quite some time 
 was this meant to be a comedy or a serious drama this film starts with a between three women fine it moves into a conflict between the women when one of them meets a man fine there are a few between them fine but when the plot and finally becomes black i started to wonder whether i had the first part of the movie it continues in this for a while until in the end it tries to go back 
 a disney movie that to do something different should at least be awarded for effort does n't make the same mistakes as one would expect from a disney movie about troubled put in a camp for the first time events are not explained in details the scenes really do serve a purpose and present several mature topics that may surprise the i must admit that at first i was a bit put off by the of the movie but soon 
 frank did so many excellent things in the world of entertainment that it 's hard to single one out as the best if i had to name the best thing he ever did though it would be his performance as machine the and dealer who is saved just barely by the love of a good woman played by an exceptionally kim the scenes between and are and the movie is very nearly perfect in fact from saul bass 's title 
 i have neither read the book on which the movie is based nor the letters between and if i came to this movie with any expectations it was maybe that the group including among others virginia and which the were part of would be it was n't which however was n't a problem for me what i am wondering about is how the people behind this movie managed to make it in my opinion so very and and most of 
 this has long been one of my of an novel although it is definitely not in the same category as the spectacular pride and is a and relatively tv version of 's novel especially considering its short length the biggest change between the novel and the movie is a good one as the unnecessary that at the end of the story is removed here and replaced with someone much more to 's character in the rest of the book i

 this movie was incredible i did not know the back story on it so i needed to let it before me on it had many and turns but still kept the story fresh and exciting the acting by was in a word brilliant as well as the is rich with as well as fresh ideas from the is truly something about ms. 's eyes that leaves a mark this movie is a look on the way in which we look 
 this was a and entertaining movie that i shall never tire of watching many many times the casting was in matching up the young with the older characters there are those of us out here who really do appreciate good actors and an story format as for she is beautiful and a gift to any kind of production in which she stars i always make a point to see in all her performances she is a actress and a pleasure 
 this might quite possibly be the worst movie i have ever seen i knew it was a before watching it it was actually the reason for watching it but i 'd never thought it could be this bad the title promises in space and does deliver however the story makes no real use of the fact that van 's character is a of van and watch out for the ending of the movie it comes at you fast i 've 
 i 've read reviews that apparently you have to have been a student in a very strict british school in the N 's to understand this maybe that 's true if so then this movie is alert the ending makes about as much sense as all the kids who 're and without having any better solution that does n't society to a mad max type the main characters could leave but they do n't the reasons they go about this

 effort aside this is n't a review about good intentions its about the final product this film is poorly written and poorly directed the story obviously had potential but that story is nowhere present in this was a human being she had love pain embarrassment weakness and doubt just like the rest of us you would never know that from this film of the lead actress 's performance in fact apply that to every character in the film but in 
 what can i say about this movie except that it is great fun john plays a recent high school graduate who has two choices learn to take up the family business of street sweeping or spend the summer at with his george played by joel murray and his i say believe me it ca n't get much than the brothers egg and tom and raymond armstrong throw in a little girl named and her and a great performance by moore 
 i saw this film numerous times in the late N 's whenever it it 's head like a with every as a saturday was always stiff competition for the that almost was n't i say christmas perhaps the greatest most film of all that 's another the time i that the of santa was almost and white so much had the color of the prints changed film is i thought so then and still do actually i was highly then

 being somewhat an independent myself i really understand what these guys were trying to do and it sounds like a good idea on paper on film however it 's awful i did n't realize the thing was made in the N 's because the film was so and bad i would have sworn this was one of those N year old where a producer tried to go mainstream and the sound i do n't know what kind of they were 
 the story behind this movie is very interesting and in general the plot is not so bad but the details writing action and use of all and the off action they are all quite most consist of someone standing up and getting shot making no attempt to run fight dodge or whatever even though they have all the time in the world the just seem for something made in features very and effects but they come off looking cheap because 
 i could n't help but feel that this could have been a bigger movie than it was the is highly and it just seemed that it could have been opened up in a way more of seven not by changing the story i think mainly through the the was the only thing that i found to be holding back the film on the other hand the was absolutely on point whoever worked on the really did their job well and

 may i start off by saying that is a very actor and i respect his work very much i wish he was in more movies that his talent with this said soul was a very very bad movie very would have to say that i lay almost all the blame on the poor script is a very actress had an outstanding performance in american beauty did well and is currently the it girl in hollywood i do n't think any

 when i watch a short like i find myself with a kind of feeling on the one hand i 'm happy i 'm watching something that has been well thought out executed and just enough to be interesting on the other hand i find myself the level of comedy generally produced tv and films are so consistently packed with easy that we find ourselves judging within a scale of then you see someone like davis who without the benefit of 
 some movies are just these are the films that obviously on a lot of goodwill and a handful of potentially great ideas but simply did n't have the budgetary means professional cast and crew members at their disposal to make it happen the definitely belongs in this category you really want to like it but even the most and N 's will have to admit the film barely reaches the level of due to its atmosphere of effects and dark

 well you know and robert patrick both are really good actors but with this movie the story was and the script was just terrible the poor actors did n't have material to work with the cover invited you to a flight action you would expect something like top gun huge disappointment the flight action in this movie is so cheap that makes you the scenes are clearly taken from and some other sources not made for this movie and they

 this is one of the worst movies i 've seen in a while the acting was just bad is usually a fairly good actor but in this film he sounded like he was reading his text from a piece of paper especially his voice over was extremely wooden van was completely over the top as boy fraser although this probably had more to do with the dialogue van ' is an of a book and it seem like the makers 
 the in the is a produced supposedly as a movie i say supposedly because the title of the movie does not have the in to indicate that it was a made for movie even though it does have the appearance of one plot is simple a band is holding a in a former factory and they are killed one by think most would agree that the movie was never going to be a but this does not excuse the here

 there are bad movies movies that are horrible and then there 's a tiny body of movies that are so bad that even after seeing them just once the sheer makes it impossible to forget them even decades later this is exactly such a movie and it 's hard to believe that the original film in this series was actually quite good let 's see george kennedy the tough guy of the original has somehow been to airline and after

 there is just one word for this film the director clearly has talent but like his character robert he throws it all has potential but like cray he ca n't be bothered to use it being drawn into crime and then into is cray 's vision of british youth like the british this film young people with no aspirations or respect cray out for attention but deserves was by the act of violence that cray chose to in the faces

 the and we use that term apparently that are trying to take over the world then states that any that does n't admit this is either of their own faith or lying to your face also every person that is interviewed in the film has found a market for their take on reality by selling to conservatives willing to let others do the thinking for them what the west needs to know is this is nothing more than propaganda aimed 
 this was a disappointing film about a young girl and her for a or film and it 's way too there are only a few moments in here not anywhere as near as many as should have been for a film of this even those scenes were n't much the music made them more dramatic that they actually is a lot of in here so the critics label this a thinking person 's film well if they think about it 
 once again i fell for it in my roots i a fun and film even a one even if it 's stupid as long as i get my fun in the mix i 'm a happy it does n't take much so i saw the cover of over at hollywood video and was kind of what it was about it looked kind of interesting so i decided to rent it why why do i always fall for it not only 
 i was n't as lucky as some of the others commenting on this film i have never seen anything else out of the shall we say mind of i agree with many some of the who spend a lot of time and are not really that attractive i liked she was so she was the acting was pretty also though delivering lines in a second language might have accounted for a lot of that problem trying to follow the plot 
 although i 'm not too much of a person i still had relatively high hopes for this movie as it does have the amazing steve and its bruce was actually a creative and comedy however comes nowhere near this and that the original has and ca n't decide whether it 's a comedy or a movie about faith and family values if it had chosen one clear path of which of these themes to focus on it could have lived

 this is one of the better classic edgar movies from the german series it features all for a highly crime movie way back from the although his mr. is missing you still have young ' once again as the typical american ' you have young in his best and just as well typical role ever the cool sophisticated british butler and you have not so young anymore as the yet very ' ironic and thus highly entertaining police investigator furthermore 
 let me start by saying overall i enjoyed the long i would give it a the good acting samuel jackson is entertaining in almost any role in this movie he does n't play his usual character the type that is in control instead davis is in control and sam is along for the ride his timing on his lines are great and he is the high point of the movie davis also gives a great as baltimore she is a

 this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two to be the single greatest film ever made i 'll put this up against any movie in terms of acting or any other aspect of it 's practically perfect in all of them a true in a sea of the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of i can think of no other film where something important occurs every other minute 
 this movie the word confused all the actors stay true to the script more 's the because the acting is fine but the script is a confused of random ideas the is slow and the gets on the nerves quickly i give it N out of N

 this movie is bizarre better put it 's ' weird i could give you a plot summary or some analysis but i would consider it a waste of your time all anybody needs to know about this movie is two young one relationship post and one really disturbing at the end of the movie you feel like you need to go take a to wash the off yourself but not in a good way like after pulp or fight club 
 if you do n't like brooks you wo n't like this film that 's a given why anyone would n't like his films is unknown to me but for those who ca n't see the light just avoid else this is a classic the entire cast is perfect is a british robin as richard lewis is his usual roger is a brilliant combination of and violence as the of and dave eric mark and the are the perfect are to

 this was a movie i could not wait to see so i finally got it and i was pretty disappointed for the movie has so little said about new york just a bunch of confusing shots of buildings streets bridges and really does n't stay focused on the new york thing that changed my mind was the french movie set inside this know that it is a but it is not a french style anyway here you will notice elements 
 it 's up there with where 's the tube it the city mind set of the period a strange man with a bizarre plan by by own and at last retreating into the bed of his parents totally absurd its the life one sees through the magic seeing things as they really are i do n't think it is ever shown anymore if so surely someone would the thing and put it out there a goes mixed up in a

 when you 're watching distant you know you 're not watching a french movie there 's little sex and it 's mostly and people do n't talk that much here there are a few lines scattered here and there and a couple of important conversations just to let you make sense of what 's going on it does n't look american either there are n't any car or or violence unless you consider the killing of a mouse an act 
 well well behaved must spend the night in a as an into a high school club problem is a powerful named was just buried there that day but he is n't quite dead and he needs the life force of humans for his film offers plenty of and an appealing and cast and most superior special rating N out of dark night is rated r for violence and adult themes 
 yes this movie is predictable and definitely not but then it does n't try to be anything it is not a with real funny a and very funny performance by peter a and down to earth performance from joan the band 's performance was on the spot each one playing their role in a manner the music was good though not great but filled out the movie from some of the negative comments i that the of some of the 
 this is a truly awful film diamond phillips simply calls this one in the use of models of the train are the plot seems to develop on the run there is an on board oh and an is on board too oh and the is dead and the train is out of control oh and the train is going to run into another train one hour ahead oh and that train has nuclear waste on it i mean come on 
 i have officially in my own mouth thanks to this expected the worst with this movie but i expected a and worst this is just terrible absolutely terrible terrible like spreading the black let me explain are speaking english it 's girl looks like she from the future set of power i really really want her to rise up from the ground and say at last after ten thousand years i 'm free it 's time to earth the i 
 republic pictures comes late in the game to the the plot has a writer returning to paris after a long trip abroad during which he developed fear during which he had he is to great as his novel that parallels an trial is a best seller the french government wants to know if he had access to secret documents something that seems more likely when an official is killed by a really falls on the writer when his ends up 
 where to start the film started out pretty well but after the N mark i caught myself watching the the at the start of the film was good but then the story kicked in it just got and as time actors gave an average performance in this movie however i got a bit of jones constant in the the film dragged on and take my word for it it dragged on it just got more and more far alert alert 
 this may not be the very worst movie peter sellers ever did i think that laurel goes to the prisoner of but it is surely the most sellers especially makeup as smith looks like he has just as he looks hardly better and spends most of the film with the exception of those disturbing scenes where he gets jolted with electrical on the verge of under the weight of all that makeup the supporting players also look tired and run 
 i 've never seen many movies in most of my life but if i 'd pick any of them i 'd pick a reference to most movies like star etc using a camera and of steel the art of turning a normal image into a painting and then putting it all together with to get a world by the story begins at the middle that for directors then the middle is at the beginning and so on when i first 
 get the cd instead the show is and the the crowd gets way too much screen time as does till the cameras spend more time on the same kid shaking his head around in the same way which leads me to believe it 's the exact same shot than they do during richard 's solo in the scenes change so quickly it 's impossible to tell where the camera is pointed and the are simply not worth the tape it 
 surprisingly not terrible and well for one of disney 's straight to video throw away like the previous the lion king N i was glad that disney brought back most of the original voice actors which makes a big difference and they kept a good level of traditional the plot around for a while but we are by an string of jokes ranging from to to break up the plot and jokes they gave us some silly musical which much 
 having heard of before but never having read a novel or a comic strip my wife and i liked the film a lot it delivered in a way a good introduction to the character and her it has some action elements it is much more an intimate play written this is also where a major of the movie is revealed an intimate play lives on the of its actors and unfortunately only half of the cast delivered while did an 
 i recently got the chance to view the and quite liked it i do n't really understand why its called that as there is n't really any going on there except maybe for the at the strip club near the end we are introduced to the main characters throughout the movie in a hospital the story shows a love affair between a guy and a healthy woman which is a very sweet you do n't get to see movies like 
 hope is just killing time getting a job her real is to eddie and have a baby april baker is too innocent to stay that way for long and falls in love too easily a dangerous parker is a and wants to be an actress all three are doomed for in best of everything ' a N soap solid movie that is aging by the in the world of publishing its not as as valley of the but not as 
 if it was n't for some i know insisting that i watch this i would never have seen this comedy this film is full of bad and moments one in particular is where the afghan police soldiers arrest don for in the streets while they allow the to carry on his arrest and then drive away still presumably to his hotel then there 's the scene where a car crashes into another car which has been turned upside down and 
 this last dutch speaking film of made me good as a film looking for all the small details and cross etc in any movie i can assure anyone interested in film art that this piece all the i have n't read gerard book on which the film is based but i still believe we get a picture of a somewhat who gets his in a way no here an surrounded by characters that have their intentions as has he all 
 it has been a long time since i have been to a movie as and boring as this one it is one thing to have a slow pace where characters are being developed in a way or some aspect of the movie clearly is enhanced by such such as in translation however there is a difference between slow and outright as happened in this one i guess from the look on 's face she must have been by the disappearance 
 moscow zero my money and i want it back this is a movie not not a movie yes this movie is a bad after many years of here at i am actually moved to set up an account just so i like at least one other here can warn people do not watch this movie it will steal your soul or at least your desire to live in a world that makes movies this bad or at least an hour 
 what an embarrassing episode last night it was either a failed script for abc special or the product of an writer just out of college making an to that classic pc from N the gun in fact & were disappointed that the closing shot was n't of the gun being down like in the movie no i 'm not some it 's just that when the producer of an & series gets it in his head that i should be 
 basically intentions N is intentions N again only poorly done the story is exactly the same as the first one even some of the lines with only a few exceptions the cast is more unknown and definitely less instead of being and drawing me into watching it i ended up feeling because it compares to watching a i 'm not sure whether to blame some of the lines on the actors or the writers and i always feel bad saying 
 this is a movie but worthy of study and first time through it the natural is to focus on & they have a peaceful thing going what with her still at home about to graduate from high school and him retired and back waiting for to do something second time through you realize how the sister 's husband is by her friends in the blues bar he takes it it 's the thing to do these days and the critical 
 bell the is an american movie supposedly based on real events that took place during the period N to is not to be confused with bell the movie a movie palmer based on the same events however i can say that i wish i had seen this other movie instead of the one i saw i enjoyed palmer 's performance in friday the as such i believe that even on a bad day she 'd pull off a better performance 
 the more i watch nicholas the more i appreciate him as an actor watching this movie now in N i can see that it does n't really fit into the of movies that was coming out in the early i do n't really think it can be considered a film but it is pretty dark at times due mostly to the lighting and odd of the performances from each of the three main actors who all did a good job 
 most of the audience just seemed to shake their heads through much of this at the sheer displayed on shift from the early days as a based phenomenon to current days as a diverse and largely west is is not given the respect of any traditional musical instrument but it can be so much more and technically complex these take the required skills for any musical instrument and timing among others and apply them to a new technology with several 
 is great as usual but the movie is nothing compared to he is probably the only one that played a perfect part in this movie but not even a like could save the of the idea of this movie and unlike most old films this movie does n't set the mood very well even at its worst any of 's movies is only though 
 this was really a nightmare of a film i saw it about nine years ago on cable tv and have n't forgotten it since is a old boy who lives in the streets of brazil and leads a criminal life in the company of his friends and they steal sell drugs and murder in order to survive each day in the first half of the film is caught by the police and sent to a foster home where he witnesses 
 for fans of type films this movie should be a treat the only thing i did n't like about the film was the fact that peter was wasted on the worst episode in general however this is a solid little movie if this is not ' best film it 's certainly one of them the best episode saved for last is the one featuring jon as a film actor it is really excellent as good as was in this role 
 i was very impressed with the latest production from as a fan of his i was used to a different kind of than displayed here he opted with a more broad style of comedy in rather than his usual low it is at times and but a decent script works past that and makes for some entertaining directed by paul who has directed almost every australian tv series tells the story of jack simpson a that belongs to his local 
 from watching the the movie looked pretty interesting the production of the movie is also pretty good it looks like they had a good budget and does n't look like a made movie the acting ranges from good joe as professor simon to ok kelly as to bad james haven as don actual content and plot of the movie is weak the movie starts out like it could become interesting and ends with a poorly executed boring twist watching the 
 miles once again assumes the role of the mighty in this the first to the original can i say this pretty much represents the plot is the script is terrible the acting is throughout the special effects well let 's not even go there all in all this movie is a of the film include and his companion not his being attacked by in a certainly saved on the budget there what has to be the most giant ever committed 
 he 's the only reason to see this film he gives a very good performance much better than this deserves he 's very and very he deserves better than this also is to see malcolm in this he 's another actor who deserves better but like he gives a very good performance so if you 're fans of either of them you might want to watch otherwise stay away one more complaint could n't we have had more scenes of 
 which plays somewhat like a prison movie chris linda blair is stuck in there after running away from her father once in the de jail she is gang by her fellow female even at N minutes with an utterly ending which makes the entire film seem year old linda blair does her best to avoid showing her body when but lets a shot slip during a scene out of 
 this is one of my three favorite movies my only is that the director peter had too many cuts showing the actors instead of together as a scene but the performances were so great i and tom are absolutely brilliant the script is great giving a very good picture of life in the theatre during world war ii and therefore what it was like in the as well lots of great lots of broad strokes all of it perfectly done 
 apparently shakespeare high which in turn a bunch of folks not seeing something for what it really is at one point in this film someone i believe 's producer warns him that film is getting off track that it was once about how the think about shakespeare through the vehicle of richard iii instead he decides to shoot a up play with random comments throughout some scenes seemed to be included as home movies for al was there really any 
 this may be a bit on the side i would like to start by saying i did not watch the entire movie nor could i because it was evident from the first hour that i was going to be disappointed that of course is the problem with taking what many believe to be an amazing book and turning it into a disney in time should have been made into an amazing movie a long time ago it 's got a 
 the on the box N trapped passengers N N you almost have to that degree of no chance in hell we 're ever going to deliver on this promise i could the 's more so if they made movies that well you know were good or at the very least worth a damn and it 's what i like about movies they are garbage you put them in a toilet and then you flush it worth the price if you 
 the plot is predictable it has been done many times in other movies you have competing summer camps in this one the rich kids vs. the competing for rights in the typical camp while the kids and pursue sex and a good time are you ready for the summer is the first and best summer camp movie for comedy as others have posted it 's no citizen kane but this type of movie is n't meant to be the film 
 i can say without a shadow of a doubt that going is the single worst film i have ever seen and yes i have seen is an as a working on a cruise that 's the plot that 's it nothing else in the film makes sense it 's all over the place like a mad man 's breakfast and not in a naked gun kind of way but more of a frustrating both shoes at the ' kind of 
 i loved this film original and different a solid intense and movie that has just the right touch of dark humor if you 're tired of the typical ridiculous hollywood movies how many big explosions and awful and shoot up gun fights that your intelligence can we take then this film is for you characters that are original and and solid performances by all actors not a weak character or performance in the film woods ' film is a breath 
 this is the worst brain damaged cheap stupid silly piece of trash i 've ever seen an garbage of instant status among fans of the bizarre if you think that ed wood 's plan N is bad well let me tell you looks like citizen kane compared to that one effects again plan N is star wars johnson is al so it 's beyond bad really but if you are looking for that kind of incredible movies it 's for 
 well as a life long fan of films i have to say this is one of the best i have ever seen sure there is nothing special about the plot but man does it as does most movies of the this film is packed with action and does not its viewers it 's so damn fun when i watch i have a on my face the whole time this also has an impact on future films like kill bill many 
 i 'm not sure it was the language or the poor acting but everything about this movie feels and looks cheap and seeing this is a huge disappointment there 's no connection between different scenes and the acting is so poor i could n't even believe people could make such a mess of something that had great above all everyone in germany speaks english big mistake the german language has a certain sound to it and especially himself only sounds 
 this films makes no efforts to hide its true a b movie it will flat out tell you in the beginning the definition of it should have also given the meaning of but the two come together in this film in ways that make you go that 's so stupid and then have you laughing for example there is a scene back in century japan which shows a couple of walking in the of a temple in the background of 
 do n't drink the water is an bad film it 's based on a N broadway play by allen it stars the comic behind the the director howard morris has appeared in several brooks life high anxiety silent movie and has made a mark in characters he has voiced include from and what went wrong i think the problem is that the is played out too seriously to work effectively allen 's original play was which is why it worked 
 this has got to be one of those films where the is N times better than the movie first saw the in N it looked then i have always wanted to see it but could never find it until today yes N years just say i was so disappointed its ok i knew it would n't be an winner but still had hopes that it would be a fun film in the unfortunately it was not it 's with all 
 the first time i saw alice in an musical comedy was in the early in a in n.y. city with some friends i remember we actually enjoyed it very much although we were left wondering why all the were covered by in various forms and why the movie was suddenly jumping from one scene to the next one leaving us what we just missed obviously it was the version which left me with the desire to watch it again soon 
 little things known in australia as is a rare find a film that promises one thing but another it is one of the few films to be made by pictures a european film studio known for making various action films & some featuring action star van & her two daughters & arrive in the town of in order to move into a large house that karen 's late husband owned after finding a 's in his effects once they find 
 david and 's brilliant acting had me in as many of the scenes were so familiar to me my husband suffered a in N and required a major operation which involved lifting his brain and the like i was enough to expect that he would return to being his former after over N years of and for him he abandoned me without warning to go and live with a woman he hardly knew he then for and i am now 
 i have done quite a few reviews on and this film is unique in that i never saw the entire movie it was so stupid and that i just could n't sit through it though i biggest problem with this and any brooks movie i call the in other words the better his movie the less of him you see in the film think about it the producers and young were great films and he was barely in them at 
 life hits us in the face we must try to stay beautiful debut movie from one of belgian 's best artists he tom a long movie and happy for worth watching and a promising piece of work it takes us into the of N main characters that live through a and night the title says a lot about the way we spend time with them we float as they do into friday night 's party where they ' 's style 
 is an actress and i 've really enjoyed all of her roles in the past especially in the she 's the man for that reason alone sydney white was a huge disappointment for me the real reason for my dislike of this film is the poor use of characters in a good fun comedy its perfectly to have a cast of all fairly characters in sydney white this idea is thrown out the makes a fine sydney but she is 
 i love they are among my favorite of film before seeing this film i had n't seen one that i had n't for this film is a great one the execution is well done there were some times early on when i and yet as the film went on the more and it became this could have been something special had the subject not been such an i appreciate his passion for film but quit your if you 're short 
 awful basically about a young man who refuses to conform or better uses to his his parents into thinking that he is attending a college truth is that this has been rejected by every school he has applied to after this junk you will see a ridiculous south institute of technology you do n't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out the of this school of nonsense problem with these type of films is that in the end 
 could this be one of the earliest films it 's actually the second this is a very beautiful piece of film produced by thomas edison this was one of many of his other think this is the most beautiful of any thomas edison films it shows a girl and moving her dress all around which turns red with the film it 's just are watching history when you watch this you are watching what began to make movies of the 
 N was the year new york city was the place was the second robert downey film to achieve some recognition the first was N achieved a much wider release pound N and palace N were even more and those N films were mean to the point that they actually stalled the prince 's feature film career for several subject at hand is and it is a mad that has to be seen to be believed i 'm not going to 
 first and i take issue to the title of this movie ' is not a spanish word the name to which they are referring is ' i imagine they dropped the 's ' because it sounds that way but i assure you it is in i thought this movie had been done years ago it came off as one of those b i watched when i was an early at home when my was out of town then it would 
 this film had a distinct allen feel about it so if you 're not a fan of dry humor dark humor or humor you probably could find something else to do if you are however this is with some nice and a flowing natural story itself is quite engaging not quite like a train from which you can not your eyes but close i mean that in the best way possible the are plenty the are enough to fully engage 
 believe it or not this movie is worse than number 's slower the acting is worse and the story is very is n't a lot of good to say about this the fight scenes are more than number three and i would have thought that is a very slow N in stuck it through hoping it would get you really want to see this movie you should try to find a cheap rental of is hard to find for purchase 
 i saw this movie when it was released and my for it has stuck with me all these years here 's why 's goal seems to be to take every literary image in the and make it if a character were to say my heart takes flight we 'd be shown an actual human heart with wings attached across the screen this process makes for some but ultimately it 's a exercise and it becomes deadly do n't the pleasure 
 i do n't know what dick steel was talking about but i found this film to be one of japan 's most to date as for or deep impact or for that matter the day after tomorrow is pale in comparison for what i know of films most of the catastrophes in films are basically run of the mill or one of which of global warming this how ever ran a different course a course of natural means where the 
 as i sit here i find myself laughing at certain moments in this film go and see this you 've ever been go and see this you 've ever wanted to go go and see this bet is that the film was from an idea out and this is the product of that chance that someone remembered it in the morning and had the application to follow it summary then go and see this film 
 i love especially in i guess she 's the kind of actress who had better not act before camera but just be herself she did that and she looked so natural in in this movie however she did try to add in more performance especially in the first half of the film so that she looked more like a editor while in the other half she totally set herself back in her daily track and i just could n't tell 
 that was a pretty damn good episode much better than the credit it camera work is best yet i love that final shot the atmosphere is the are great and the guest cast minus the victims is strong what i do n't like about this episode is that many things that are left why does it change sex what 's the purpose and they 're aliens what kind why were they never shown again in the later i 'm giving 
 this is the worst movie i 've ever seen i 'm not the next time it comes on i will just continually run my head into a wall it would me more to sit in an emergency room trying to explain to a doctor why my brain is than attempting to make it through this movie hope that black and never work together on a project this bad again they are both good so i was shocked this was so 
 the best film about marriage and family this is a very interesting to the couples that will be come to the dangerous and world of marriage and family this decision could be the better or the worst in our lives and the life of our kids the real or help of ' if we the real role of families they can help or they can destroy us the mad who possibly is not much mad telling what could happen according 
 i had seen the cure when i was a kid and i loved it then now years later i got a hold of a copy almost by accident and watched it again being a kid you do n't really have the ability to things for yourself that you want that is usually a of your parents but when i watched it again now i felt sorry that i did not do more to get a copy of this movie back 
 i have always been interested in anything about so when i was around looking for a movie to rent this one caught my eye it was the worst $ i 've ever spent and i want my money back please do n't waste your money on this this was one of the cheapest movies i 've ever seen the entire movie was so boring and i found myself rolling my eyes a lot and i did n't even watch it 
 ironically the most american film in the N new york film festival is N in spanish the film 's controversy began at the festival there were and considerable doubts about commercial prospects as the star del got the best actor award there i 'm talking about steven 's ' of course that 's the name it 's going by in this version shown in new york as at in two segments without opening title or end credits ' is certainly 
 warning first of all i rated this movie N out of idea is good but there are too many stupid errors in the movie failing to make it the drama that it might have been first of all she never fights alone after an initial very strange doubt from her mother which is not when the mother proves to be so supportive and later in the movie the rape victim is not alone she is also always falling into the 
 this film is a fun little private eye story like they are n't made any more it 's all there tom conway is the called the falcon what 's in a name is his is the in and of course there are the the professor with the secret formula the bad guy that wants the formula and the police inspector who 's after the falcon there is a murder and the falcon gets the is night clubs expensive hotel rooms 
 look although we do n't like to admit it we 've all have to our fears concerning the extreme likelihood of experiencing the events that take place in this movie you know you get into your car and you immediately start thinking i hope today is n't the day that my at a comfortable speed of N mph all four door break in the locked position both my main and emergency fail my switch ca n't be turned off and 
 i did n't even want to watch this movie after reading 's review and N star rating i watched it anyway on the advice of my son and found it much better than i expected i would give it N stars out of a N star system you have to watch the movie more than once to understand it all if you do n't know much about you will miss a lot i from high school the year the movie 
 i got all excited when i saw the ads for this movie because i recently read the book and really enjoyed it the movie however did not meet my expectations having read the book recently prepared me for big let down as often happens when stories are translated into movies the characters did n't seem to fit very well with the book the direction was weak i had a hard time getting into the characters there was n't a real 
 as a rule i try to find as much in films as i possibly can to enjoy them i made no exceptions with doing my very best to appreciate it for what it was but no effort no matter how great could possibly redeem this excuse for a failed for a number of reasons the was and the script reached of ' that took it well and truly beyond the bad it 's good ' category the acting left amounts 
 why did i waste my time with this movie there was not a single funny joke or line throughout the was n't even mildly funny i mean really an out of control vacuum pipe why has the national 's name been attached to this movie even christmas vacation was better than this i actually thought that film was very funny like the 
 a dark and painful look at the of drug is wonderful in this film just watching his and and rage near the end of the film is enough to make anyone think twice about trying maybe they should show this to kids in health class instead of the we are to endure year after 's the story of a man who is simply trying to make a new clean life for himself after being in prison trying to rid himself 
 well it 's robin as ' all right just as advertised that did n't sound very hopeful and it was worse than i 'd robin i can take a robin who with a 's daughter i can credit but a robin who exchanges with his single is harder to and a robin and entire cast who seem to be having difficulty managing their lines is the of how could anyone let such delivery pass without the scenes again and again 
 despite the title and unlike some other stories about love and war this film is n't too and because love is as a rose with that is the four leading actors set their characters realistic and with a good sense and balance between the and the the music and of the sung b herself drag the deeper and deeper in the film from one place to another between the war and the peaceful love some people may find it too 
 i really do n't know why i agreed to watch this movie but like a complete fool i did and for that i deserve to be shot i had seen the original well i say i have seen it i started watching it but found it that bad that i ended up watching it in speed to get it over with and get rid of the dialogue but i said i would watch it and i did even if it 
 there are some things i can never understand such as this movie what if i were to create a really really cheap and looking and model in and then proceed to cut and that into an video having people and getting by the same thing how can anyone even believe that an utterly fake that looks completely out of place would influence the events in this movie i know that its low budget and all but the producers could do 
 the man in the white suit is one of those that studies made so well in the N 's and N 's the plot of this one follows a man that a that neither gets nor breaks of course this is a huge in the world of however things are not that simple as the will threaten the way of life of many people including manufacturers the mill 's and even an old lady that does her every week the 
 i think i 'll be the only one who 's saying this but yes i was a during the film not to say that this is a bad movie in fact it 's a very good attempt at portraying the dilemma love it 's the director 's debut read from somewhere is it true i felt that something 's not quite right maybe it 's just me i 'm not drawn to the characters enough to me in their world 
 i 'm not a movie maker but i do know it is hard to tell a story in seven minutes and draw your audience into the character horses on does this and more when you are watching a good movie you do n't want it to end this is how i felt watching this film it is and the takes on such human that you feel you are on the with looking forward to see what exciting mr. anderson takes 
 i 've seen this a few times and the more a see of it the less i like it jamie lynn was approached to do this because of the fact that she is 's sister and i 'm sorry to say that that in the show is obvious they 've created the character to be everything people want to believe jamie lynn is original smart pretty popular etc the characters around her are only there to make her look better 
 as a young when this came out i completely related to it as an adult in the present american culture it does n't have enough to be called if you are looking for american or and jokes will with and a guarantee if you like bill murray and you like good clean fun you will probably like and enjoy this film very much similarly with shack etc enough said just go watch it and stop it it 's for out

 a truly excellent look at the world and the realities of being a the movie is one that will hit much too close to home to those who were involved in the drug culture and have knowledge of what being or being around a really is good movie which will never truly be excellent performances by all involved and the set is 's way of showing how bleak a 's world can become worth a look an education of sorts 
 man i think people have forgotten how to watch a movie everyone thinks they 're a critic they comment on things that the average movie does n't even know or think enjoyed the film it was what i was expecting therefore was not disappointed steven gets a bad for putting his views into his films but that 's also a reason to watch what 's even more funny is the people that complain about his films say he 's the 
 no love movies but this has got to be the poorest attempt to make one ever calling it a movie is also a stretch this is not worth this is about as interesting watching as some random family 's holiday pictures and it has about the same quality you would expect when you send your ten year old son into the woods with your new and tell him to make a 
 henry what we have long believed lincoln was like it is a through 's performance we are led to believe on the surface that lincoln was a country but through his confrontation with the lynch and especially during the court proceedings you can see that beneath the exterior is a brilliant man who has a very good command of what is going on around him and how to influence the people around him in this movie henry shows that he 
 i do n't agree with one of the who compared this film to the american international pictures has directed a realistic film with an honest attempt to the rise of in post war england but without the of the was excellent as it really captured the and of the huge housing estate the estate looked like an old prison stanley baker was excellent as the to the division five he finds he is the of many jokes david showed that 
 the one and only was a great film i had just finished it on on i am an independent professional and i thought this was a good of what life is like as a professional now this film was made N years before i was born but i do n't think the of professional traveling has changed all that much sad funny and all around great

 i 'm really not going to waste my time with in analysis i 'm just going to say that i 'm extremely disappointed that made the mistake of being in the main role in this absurd nonsense in this full of boring to death try in there is no point in trying to find the positive sides of this movie because as a whole it is poor in every single way and the thing is that is dragged so into 
 only one word can describe unfortunately this is n't no looks can and that 's exactly what does based on the old leslie plays a near blind man upon a pair of thieves now he must hunt them down using basically and that 's all this film plays off the of now maybe if they had some funny jokes involving this but pretty much it 's just one of those on your face because you 're too to admit you 
 on broadway a chorus line was pure magic from the second the show opened with a spectacular burst of energy to the truly grand a call of all those chorus members who we grew to love during the course of the show we were totally engaged by the intensely personal stories some funny some some of this chorus line the movie is another matter entirely the focus is now on the director and what an he is every time the 
 one of the most famous of all movie still interesting today although it does have an old movie look to it the second serial looks better but simply does not equal this one actors have a good time especially and great by the universal expert crew the musical score was tracked in from universal 's unknown the man the black cat and of london and what great action music it was if there was a choice for best serial this 
 the best part about this movie is that you can watch it over and over again still not be content of watching it i have watched this movie least N times over the past N years and still it makes me as if i was watching it for the first time i have great for good like the series and many others but this one in is one of my favorite outstanding movies some of them recently in are series 
 this is the australian tv series it is a classic the stories and actors are excellent who can forget and his or being this is tv the australian actors in the series were the best of their day and have in the outsiders what can i say the music and song just the closing credits starting with the close up of the then sleeping being around and then the long shot just can not get much better than that all

 i ca n't believe some of the scores this film is getting on the have i been issued with the special edition version by produced by bernard matthews this film should be in i 'm sorry for all the but if you 're elsewhere and you 've got no to cut or you have n't got a beer collection to then this film might just be worth N of your remaining as long as you have n't got any to 
 i saw this on recently and through the i found that there were seven crime doctor movies with warner as the is a bit long in the compared to his performance in street a decade earlier not and a bit today the movie also has a touch of the possible the plot black and white and characters are far more complex than those of the mr. and charlie chan series there are unexpected and appearances by a number of b 
 there is no question as to who is in command of the training of in this film major davis pat o'brien o'brien plays an officer who to military discipline in the creation of a new kind of from his the but he is not so rigid as to be unfair or unfriendly in fact he even changes his opinion as to the value of women working in the military he 's tough when he has to be yet at other 
 golden boy is humor on in the of educational moments the main character around getting himself into the situations involving women it 's just that he 's shy on the surface but everything until he can learn something from it the most striking feature of the series are the circumstances surrounding his education which are outright embarrassing yet funny at the same time 
 from the beginning of the movie i had a feeling like its a movie about another 's from friday the and it is dispute that the movie starts interesting but as the times goes by its just a movie about silent serial killer i mean he goes under the guy 's bed without making any sound not seen by anyone he was supposed to be blind after failed execution but he walks and people like he used to i 'm 
 if the and director intended to open hearts with the movie as the wanted to do with his music they succeeded with me human situations became original personal and immediate so that i personally felt touched by each situation i believe i would credit the power of music combined with the point of view of the person writing the movie without i can say that i was very moved by the movie 's approach to living have n't actually out 
 've seen quite a few bad movies in my days a lot of them in the company of mike tom and the others from so was the case with this one as well and even though i found the movie in itself quite funny it would n't have been nearly as fun without the movie is a prime example of really bad movies coming out of europe during the horrible music horrible acting horrible plot what little there is horrible

 first of all does n't look anywhere near old enough to play 's daughter and in fact she is n't only ten years apart understand this is supposed to be one of those type but this is beyond the pale very very weak in terms of acting script and direction the only one who really here is who makes this film if not really herself as she 's cast as a bit of a sex but nonetheless actually and the

 i would n't be so quick to look at all the good reviews and say this might be a good show this show is only good if you do n't know what talent is i wo n't even say how offensive it is i know it can be offensive to a lot of people because not really what me about the show what me is that people watch this and think it 's funny it makes me feel like our 
 everything about this show is terrible its even sets itself up to get cheap with bad writing a family has already been used too many times most notably by the which is an excellent show with great writing and many meanwhile family guy has about five minutes of story in each episode with tons of celebrity jokes and random thrown in now if this was original or funny sure i 'd think it was but no it 's not funny 
 this movie just was not very funny there 's not much else to say other than that it was kind of embarrassing for laurence and david both of whom deserve much better than this also i do n't understand why after this movie completely and utterly insisted on making it into a tv show 
 first real movie in this year amazing long shots sometimes with fix camera so specific for let aside a true film i find it it simply all my and keep in mind how the image goes violent and painful during the scenes when he 's trying to kill himself that 's the point i do n't think it stands up in the whole plot why if this was an ideal world could n't you die but still you were keeping 
 i went it to see this film with caution a comedy did n't seem consistent having a brother who is has attempted and seeing the devastation that has caused our whole family i know first hand how it can be to deal with this issue i must say this film deals with it in a way that allows the inside someone who is suffering and simply does n't know why or how to stop it while the film is not 
 the 's on me is undoubtedly the most controversial film in the ' N years of the reason is by today 's standards this film can be considered for this reason it is rarely shown if ever on me just state that for the record the japanese seen in the film were not soldiers they were sent to a relocation center during world war ii they were treated and shown as the evil enemy in this film by all accounts 
 ok i do n't want to upset anyone who enjoyed this film but it was a really bad movie just the way the scenes were and the acting it made me at some points i really tried to enjoy it but it was like a student film they must have had the smallest budget i really liked the story line to an extent and the characters were but the film on a whole was just awful also why is it 
 worst film ever but film ever rolled in one you have got to see this film it is so cheap it is but you have to see it really watch the 
 when i bought this i though this got be the ultimate space landing to the earth and starts right away to kill people well it was almost everything what i expected typical movie from the N 's acting has to be the worst i 've ever seen especially the girl playing the lead role and the girl that played the made me laughing my off so why ' does n't fall in to category bad that it 's good ' 
 john wayne and are who ca n't seem to stay in one place very long in the boys are headed to where they meet up with 's tom mack brown who offers them a job it 's a to see the boys wearing as they start out as with the although becomes when miss hunt into camp is tom 's girl but the attraction between her and is evident early has a cattle to move and to running the drive 
 as an ancient movie fan i had heard much about the controversial movie assessed as one of the most realistic by some and as one of the most movies by others i decided to see it in the entire version to evaluate it myself hoping to find something positive that would make justice to the many accusations the film i sat down in my chair one autumn evening and started to watch the beginning from the new shocked me a 
 this is a complete so cheap and it would n't deserve more than a couple of 's also a with a script served by such and acting you 're always aware there 's a set a camera a fake no direction no suspended reality to allow you into the tension of the small and rooms in the original japanese N & N is all but lost here in sets and worst of all the moral and suffering which both a 
 my friends and i that movie last night and we had one of the greatest in the movie is not supposed to be funny at all but it is just so ridiculous and it lacks any first i forget what his character is called and i do n't really care uses his regular employee to go through all the terminals not only is that but it gets topped when his enormous efforts in his finding the which hosts the computers 
 i i would never allow myself to into to the authority figures of the who told me things were better in the good old days the current australian prime minister is a example of just such a mind i switched over to a decade under the influence because i found watching the on the other channel such a experience i found the values expressed by the too to accept as reasonable so so of any sense of at a society 
 this was the worst film i have seen in a long time all the performances are fine but there is no plot really no plot a bunch of talk about this and that and that 's your film robert 's character is and keeps asking the same people the same over and over this earns him the same responses over and over i am pretty sure this film got a six because people think they should like it good performances 
 just came out of a for this film it had me laughing every N the ending was so funny that were rolling down my face and it had me i had n't bought that large coke there are definitely some but overall highly entertaining the movie lets steve have a chance to after stealing the from both jim in bruce and will the of ron in their movies paul is as always i love that he can be so funny 
 first off i hate sci stuff and although this movie got a little sci at times that 's because at least it focused on in the last N seemed to have kind of been mentioned but the stories never really focused on him which made me mad what also makes me mad is the amount of N 's it got on the voting chart give it a rest people if you saw this movie and liked it please vote for 
 new with this film will recall how of its time it is and how well cast and crew captured america new york city of that 's script the different the various live in and 's direction brings out performances all around peter 's talent is on display as never before nor since clearly it is the best character portrayal the always dennis patrick ever i will always remember about joe is the feeling of having been in a state of 
 i really do n't know much about the de not having read any of his book but i never him as a queen carson of eye for the straight guy or jack from will and grace would have fit easily into the role that mancuso gave movie itself was rather thin and seemed more of a or an excuse to show the paris several times with men and women having a good time on the in the what they ca 
 the film lacks style i mean original style everything looks including action first appearances in the movie delivery etc etc yes there the were original like in the beginning a car is shown with number up number and few seconds later it starts falling down a hill with number that was one in many of the movie anything good in the movie yes for fans if there are any in for fans his and action it nothing else so watch 
 this film is definitely up there with the worst films i 've ever seen probably in my top N of worst films i once and that was when building something 's secretary i hope its a barber shop that was literally the only time i in this ' awful compared to bruce which as a big jim fan was n't even that great this movie lacked the of having god 's powers and was more about family class it solely 
 blind spot one of my festival i was totally by the idea of three searching for a man who has loved and each of them in different ways the cast is great james franco is particularly amazing as the boy from los angeles his journal which we hear in work well with the and are quite intense the film has a powerful style it elements like the road movie and in new it also plays with time and perspective in 
 it 's hard to believe people actually like this i do think kids can enjoy it but to me it 's the kind of kid film parents ca n't bear to sit through predictable plot boring and possibly the worst kid actor of all time i will give the director some of the responsibility for the kid but she was truly painful to watch i feel embarrassed for her now having people know it was her when she sang the 
 i was enough to see the last stop here where i live at the moving pictures film festival for those of you that do n't know the moving pictures film festival is a tour of canadian made film in canada i was told just before the movie started that it was the world premiere and that it was on the verge of getting an american distribution deal which added to my 'm a big movie fan and yes i love 
 for a long time it seemed like all the good canadian actors had headed south of the border and i all the second rank ones filled the top and that left the for the sex film was a real surprise despite the that are typical of the actors seemed to be trying to put something into their characters and what we the got back was almost true suspension of belief when the from the music video attacked the police you 
 from the start you know how this movie will end it 's so full of your typical member will not even like this movie i give it N out of N only because of the acting of william benton i ca n't believe people voted for this movie it 's so a point of view ' once a thief people are n't born bad neither are they born good they are born with a clean slate it 's society parents 
 house of games has a strong story where and illusion play a big part a offers to help a patient with his gambling debts and gets caught at the you ever felt for something that was both dangerous and wrong watch what happens if you pursue this urge and go all the way sit on the edge of your chair as are being and victims turn into you 're never sure of who is exactly who in this is both

 based on a fairly best seller this film like most other lifetime movies played out more like a than an actual movie the only difference here was that meredith was n't in it the women in this do n't age even over a span of like N years and the acting in general is pretty characters in this were all and the story was of the nature i would n't recommend it but it 's the kind of thing that 
 no one is a greater fan of macdonald fraser 's papers than i was surprised to see just now that richard directed royal since i also see he had made the with fraser which i though turned out rather so royal was N years old when the film was released and could not have been more enthusiastic since i had read all the papers published up to that time and was with a orange and malcolm i still am but 
 and big foot 's engine company getting 's used to these up as a kid but catching an episode of the series three now several years later they the theatrical of the raiders of the seven N i can see how they do n't hold up all that well the character of is n't exactly sympathetic to begin with and 's failed to much interest either in short the scripts were thin fairly awful and generally to they 're strictly 
 yes i 'm & but this movie and it 's theme song remain one of my all time robert downey jr. does such justice to the role of louis and the although is romantic & makes one believe in happy 
 this movie is not great but it is a good and one it feels like an film made out of a play script morgan freeman basically plays himself although the director the script was not written for him and there is the small irony of the actor that goes in a supermarket to do research for a film that he has n't committed to yet i mean he actually made the film in the end and we are watching it 
 bugs bunny ends up at the south while trying to vacation in florida where he meets a little which he tries to save from an this short tries and the is but in the end it 's a bit too light in the department the is n't really that great of a for bugs and i just seen a lot better bugs bunny frankly even other when he 's with other unknown so i ca n't in good recommend this 
 this movie had lots of potential beautiful women guys a beach beer a hot a mansion on the beach a pool a who her job and really nice cars however the movie had one thing that doomed it to failure a full length script and a bunch of women who want to give acting a try because they think it would be a cool 's put it this way if you find yourself at a party and you have a 
 considering all the films like the breakfast club and pretty in that are it is surprising that this one is so is no sex in it but sex is thought of including the idea that it may matter what others think about it the kids do not always get along with their parents but neither the parents or the kids are seen as always right or wrong and the parents are not seen as deals with how one girl does 
 this film is worse than cat people which i saw during the same week it has all the N 's style the real ones who are social not pc commercial type boys and a bad guy called i really like and the film does that blue lighting N 's feel but the rest of it looks like low budget canadian i have seen so much of this while living in this great country and realize these type of movies were 
 every time the supposed and we the audience is to set its first sights one of the new for some reason the decided to with an emergency or some false alarm or some bit of dramatic so instead of enjoying the surface of or standing over the of or concentrating on the magic of flying by a or an we are into worrying about the and survival of the characters big let down the seem to be what they want 
 i am a huge scott fan so i was surprised and disappointed to find he is barely in this film the movie really belongs to robert who is the hero in the and the one in the love good gets more screen time than mr. scott in this movie for many viewers that is not a problem but i am from the walter school of not although i will say that his lines were a bit more than in this 
 it is considered fashion to highlight every social evil as a result of and male dominance however this ' may be however within the story and theme of the film there is no grey area and the woman who should be called the film 's is the of the story under no circumstances can what she did be justified of women is just in this case and has nothing to do with the it is of the ultimate sort the 
 twelve to the N did anyone else notice all the things that stayed the same all the stars returned for twelve and was added twelve had the same director twelve had the same producers twelve had the same production designer twelve had the same music director twelve had the same film anyone notice the things than changed once the franchise was established twelve 's budget was $ N million N greater got great reviews but twelve largely got made $ 
 as a person who knows the ship and some other ships too i can not see the movie as a movie only as a movie is has some great wonderful shots of the ship most of them done on an existing vessel apart of the ones in the disaster scenes of course and a certain room under deck but regarding the story and i only can call it big nothing of that would happen like this on a real sailing 
 how has this piece of stayed on tv this long it 's terrible it makes me want to shoot someone it 's so fake that it is actually worse than a movie i 'd rather have a than watch this nonsense i remember watching it when it first came out i thought this could be interesting then i found out how absolutely stupid it really was it was so bad that i actually took out my and stuck my hand 
 well i will come clean and admit that i was forced as part of my history degree to watch this film and then write a short film review as part of my even if i had watched the film alone at my own discretion i found it extremely boring and absurd the style is dated beyond its years and the acting is rather than use dialogue they instead exchange eye at each other or sometimes into thin air for me 
 it 's strange what fate does to some people while looking in the discount at a retailer i came across a copy of deadly being a of any film that is either or featuring i decided to buy it not to mention the fact that it cost five dollars a bargain believe me after it i came to the opinion that it was nothing special but after doing some research on the i discovered that the film was actually called 
 neatly over everything from the coup in cuba to his entry into part two of 's portrayal of is that of the hero as with part one this rather guerrilla through the of is probably to more people than it will satisfy so why was the film and particularly del 's performance so praised at james for instance called it a work of art that 's not just the story of a revolutionary but a revolution in and of itself 
 if you as i have a very close and long relationship with the world of do yourself a favor and watch this beautiful about and his life creating so brilliant and a very cool production the whole background story about and the people and also very much the many different situations he was influenced by for good and worse is amazing there is a very fine and obvious connection between the comic books and just this i will for sure 
 i saw the rating on this movie and on the basis of that decided to watch this movie which my had she said she had seen it before it 's funny and sad i the first time i saw it she maybe compared to other movies this deserves a out of N but in comparison to all the other movies i have seen in my lifetime this deserves no more than a any movie where i can guess what is 
 surely this film was up by the studio perhaps not but i feel there were serious flaws in the that if not attributed to the process could only be caused by bad criminal indeed writing and understand the effect burton to achieve with the acting similar to the atmosphere of edward but here unfortunately it falls flat and no of but only the offensive of bad acting and even for a not that scary indeed only mildly amusing in its 
 i love don let me just say that he is an enormous talent and the best at what he does which is a nervous loser thrown into a position of authority he is in this role as roy fleming the reluctant but the film is pretty really even though as a kid my brother and i in watching this and his other films it 's still worth watching but really it 's a film that is best enjoyed by children 
 this movie has horrible ratings from just about everyone who has voted here but i am here to say if you like movies like my car and and this movie is for you if your into movies like citizen kane and have to you in a different yet i still love this movie and everything about it even if it is kind of this is one of the few movies me and my have been able to keep watching over 
 as ben once observed nothing goes out of style than comedy steve martin 's latest offering N ' recently opened to bad reviews and dismal while mike ' love ' seems to have won few N it was jerry lewis ' turn to feel the pain of rejection ironically his character in this film a funny turn whenever anyone uses that word in his presence when way to the front ' effectively drove him off the big screen for almost 
 i could n't this piece of if i wanted to after watching dark harvest N i thought this has got to be the worse movie ever made then i watched dark harvest N and that made N seem a little better then i watched dark harvest N or tried too the only thing i have to say is when is this going to end very bad acting and really bad special effects the only good thing about this movie was 
 in N i wrote the following statements on an message board when a user if the best years of our lives was a forgotten movie to me watching this movie is like opening up a time i think in many ways the best years of our lives is probably one of the more character studies and it holds up extremely well as a look at life in the us in the after i believe coming home and the hunter both 
 i have to tell you i 've been a fan of star since i was a sometime ago i gave a friend of mine some episodes and i asked him man what are you watching lately because i 'm done watching all episodes he said well i got these episodes of i said ok let me try it i was pretty sure at that time that i like it because i was just watching and found it great i had 
 i enjoyed watching this well acted movie very much it was well acted particularly by actress hunt and actors steven and jeff was a very interesting movie filled with drama and from the beginning to the very that everyone take the time to watch this made for television movie it is excellent and has great acting 
 what is the point of creating that have absolutely no to the original film no point this is why the night are so original film a group of children a dark secret that eventually get them all killed bar one in a act of can someone please explain to me what a dead rising from the grave to steel the crown has to do with the first movie then night N had plot that left the audience constantly wondering how 
 i do n't know how people can watch this the only people who enjoy watching this are those who have no feelings and and enjoy watching people die houses down car crashes die and cast members being killed off every week its the most absurd thing on television and i still do n't know how it pulls in the ratings its so i can imagine the writers sitting down and saying who shall we kill of next week then ' 
 this movie starts out with an early scene in which frank morgan advises against gary 's marriage to his daughter frank morgan playing an complains to about his perceived at the hands of his family including his daughter i am a fan of all N actors frank morgan is to my mind a hollywood a and a very lovely and actress seldom seen in the leading role i also have nothing against wright and while not with great range she 
 we saw la at the international film & video festival & liked film into the fear we all have fear of rejection fear of and most fear of our own three lead actors as as as are match well to their roles and are excellent it was a to witness the dynamic between the three of them as it seemed believe is a stand out i hope we see much more of her in the coming film does n't take 
 fool for love is one of the several now forgotten films robert altman directed throughout the this one a screen of a sam play that features in the lead role just simply is n't very good altman made many films over the course of his career and many times the fault was his but here i think the fault lies with for writing such a play altman 's direction is assured the performances are given what the actors have to 
 this movie was fun if all over the essentially follows the of two in century england who move from conventional body to trafficking in and dead aliens i have no idea what the was doing in there and neither did the producers i think but was it funny you bet even ron perlman who is often the of direct to death was pretty good in this one as a who turns out to be the of a rival gang of 
 this is a really cool movie i remember first seeing it when i was really young and i used to watch it all the time like once a week shadow was my favorite character in the movie bound is really funny and its really cool how they train the animals to do all those things parts of the movie are sad though such as when sassy the cat falls down the and when shadow falls in the hole at the 
 i believe anyone who enjoyed 's ivan the terrible movies would enjoy this well movie this movie played out like lord of the ring return of the king but without the special effect but as good and better have the german who dressed like of russia the russian summoned to lead them to fight the german to save russia who played ivan in the ivan the terrible films was as the first N how he handled the passing by was 
 when i saw do on broadway i never that one day i would see an actress like playing the role on screen but here really lets her hair down for some good comedy moments as the to be walter 's wife so he can go on with the he 's told 's a story played for from beginning to end stuff that never runs out of dry humor and throughout its running time there are plenty of or that are 
 well after watching this i can say that it ai n't the worst movie ever made yes folks there is worse than this there are some good points to the movie you get to watch have horrible deaths and looking eating some science experiment and getting huge the drunk the doctor and yes a girl in underwear that has absolutely no shame i personally wait for the to eat these i was for the the e time it had a 
 this dizzying football film from director oliver stone seems to have everyone in the cast well everyone except william h. macy who could have the role played by mr. stone the team doctors or the selling cereal if you 're a fan of the there are some great you can on friends and the film is sometimes good as background party atmosphere especially during the first two hours it even features some music video scenes any given sunday oliver stone 
 this to in the heat of the night will suffer in inevitable comparisons to its better predecessor instead of looking like a theatrical movie for television looks like a tv movie for theatrical release with photography opening titles and sets that look like they 're made of the murder has a error the camera shows two hands the girl then a shot of a hand reaching for a then a shot of the girl being with two hands again and 
 there 's no denying the first film was a commercial product it was an of a popular and had cast of young attractive actors and certainly was n't lacking in the budget department yet it more than for what it was and i ca n't deny i enjoyed it N lacks just about everything that made the original so wonderful the first thing that should set alarm bells ringing is the absence of the at the helm with him he 
 some aspects of this production are good such as the performances of george and but am i the only one who is by the horrible performance by as she is terrible she the with her voice and in a role she clearly does n't understand i also think the chorus is n't up to they drag the and make the worst overall i think this production is but can be so much more if done this production does n't come 
 what if albert joe and senator were to come together in a evening of this roman never uses the actual names of the characters it so and not only for the individuals they must have been but also for what they came to represent over time if you are confused by or if you like your movies served up and you wo n't like this film it is a demanding that rewards on many levels the with the intelligence to 
 it 's a little to have a character named young in a movie played by young but this film is where got his name and also a nice career boost after playing small parts under another 'm going to go against the majority of the other comments and state that i really enjoyed this film mainly because of the performance of barbara as she was funny angry vulnerable and as the oldest of three daughters whose mother died on the 
 this interesting lost film written by stars and as two southern brothers on a to open a restaurant kidder was never and should have been originally titled the brothers this with a violent ending is a pure where is this film i 've been searching for it for N years was still great back then and i 'm surprised it does n't have more of a following maybe it does these guys are a with more than brains but totally 
 had clearly not seen the film in decades and his memory is his attempts to the mark scene as suspect are utterly as are his incorrect comments about the bad guy at the kid 's body is for the entire time the man is in the room and the man barely gives him a scene is a crude attempt to show 's innocent about the man 's everything in this film it 's badly done but nothing 's comments about

 kenneth 's hits all the marks the acting is the is the and sets are stunning and patrick doyle 's score also is sensitive and moving oh the by some guy named will s. is n't too bad either film critics for receiving the films ' fourth for the but his decision to use the full text was a one i ca n't think of many better ways to make four hours fly every decision makes works the use of 
 i think that most people would agree with me if i were to say that the movie pretty much set the bar for atmosphere i 've seen quite a few movies match that bar but none have ever exceeded 's and halls the is a film that tries very hard to reset the bar i believe the even mentioned something about being as scary as yet not once throughout the movie did i ever feel even the bit scared or 
 i 've always loved from some of the usual well-known like the to some of the more like black christmas or just before but who are people even calling this trash a it 's straight up the acting is the worst ever on film really i 've seen better on an episode of the young and the for when the woman comes to tell them about the of she sometimes for a matter of seconds as if someone is her 
 this movie is excellent is beautiful and is his little when scared and the parts are when is caught under the and when and are never had this feeling totally recommend this movie its coming out on special edition on june cover has on a garbage can and the just explain this movie more than romantic and scenes are funny all the dogs have something funny i kids will love it when it comes out it has new features 
 not very interesting saved from being a turkey from some decent performances the main cast consisting of and surprisingly meredith are all good but the story is not very original 
 is a funny movie everyone at the has seen it and all say the same the of was a great part of the movie also the loud speaker so and so you have left you right indicator on or when jack goes home and down on the and cracks a beer is hard work me up and when his shows interest by joining the club and calling number jack buying all the tickets to win the meat bloody great movie 
 in this film gary plays a defense attorney who was formerly a prosecutor he is a bit but is more or less playing a regular guy rather than some sort of or monster funny thing is he does n't quite pull it off i guess you ca n't quite get to normal from there kevin was sufficiently the scene in the park was way too long with way too many false and the odd sex scene with and karen young 
 amazing one of my favorite movies way down at the bottom guess i can take some pride in not what the general tends to go for mason is in this movie and so 's i can never get enough of his tactics just like in moving he was also notable in national 's christmas vacation love that guy 
 after reading the book i happened across this at for N and thought sure what the hell i got the and watched it last night when i started watching it i the run time and it was about N minutes i thought ok cool it seemed to run rather slowly knowing the story and how much of it there was by the time i got to the actual killings i was like how much time does this have left one 
 i do n't want to write too much about the film but basically it 's an with a little bit of thrown in about two men who come together in unlikely circumstances and become highway men together performance by robert and everybody else involved a brilliant ' who really makes you hate him some great lines actually out loud amazing action and a great plot choice of music and all basically directed and written i recommend this film to anyone 
 i completely disagree with the previous this movie has amusing moments but hardly a unless you really think from a tank and heads in a vice are a in fact the only reasons i gave this a N instead of a N are because a two of the actors are decent b the is above average with some pop thrown in for contrast and c. the monster truck is pretty than that this is a movie with some or interesting 
 i received this movie as a gift i knew from the cover this movie are going to be not watching it for more than a year i finally watched it what a movie almost did n't finish watching this bad movie but it will be unfair of me to write a review without watching the complete me when i say this movie i am truly shocked that some bad got even financed to make this movie but it could n't 
 chuck decided to put one final in the his film career before going to the safe world of night with this bad such a movie this thing sure is is frank first off what kind of last name is have you ever met any has no listing last name which opens up any half the a in with an i he and his partner do the same old buddy routine you have make funny with the and make their looking 
 i bought this film from my local blockbuster for an it 's been sitting in my video for at least a year now then tonight i decided to see it the film was quite different to what i had expected and i did n't find any in it all i saw was that it was a bleak look at people dealing with love relationships and sexual and i did n't really see the killer plot really having a point except 
 with its few of works as but as a major statement to the original it things begin somewhat promising during the 's opening credits we see and hear several interesting shots and sounds the baby 's black with the cross the kitchen carried into the 's apartment and dropped in shock the is shown sticking out of the floor and the of the itself without tenants or furniture can be heard here from the previous film 's interesting too is 
 directs this light as a story jean and her equally father david holiday in the south of france with things are fine until family friend shows up a finds the of too hard to resist that 's fine with as long as her and leaves her as he 's done with all the women in his past including when it appears as though she 's becoming second in 's life exact on tells the story in from 's perspective and 
 i watched this film a few nights ago and it was awful long even though they managed to through the majority of his life boring the parts they included were and for some reason the director chose to cut away from some of the action and left huge parts of the film inaccurate the ' side to this film was a joke and last time i khan was n't exactly a nice guy acted i found several of the characters 
 this and is truly a modern the is and delivered with wooden the is predictable there are a few decent and characters remain for most of it and yet there is a certain kane brings to life the sick monster of a man with a lot of though it is somewhat like his character that he 's been playing around ten years and so i 'll find it quite amusing when people say it 's not much of a reach 
 tim did a job this film i say this because he avoided convention and he also performances from susan who won an for her role and penn even more amazing does n't he just tells the story and lets the events play on the 's mind this is so effective because it allows the to form his own opinions on the death penalty one of the most controversial subjects of our time without being unfairly in either direction i ca 
 how was my little tells a story that is sad scary and it ends with a that you knew had to happen even though you were hoping maybe even it would n't this is the film 's greatest strength it plays with your and expectations then drops a bomb on you i saw this in a film theory class at back in the it is not easy to find but is definitely worth hunting for 
 i 'll start by to everywhere for using the terms film or movie in connection with this but criminal and crime against seem a bit writing acting too for technical skills used to this none of waste could hardly be called the majority of family home movies come closer to earning that than no this is just a N car caught on 'll the plot in this review because there are far too many to be covered at once let 
 i watched this movie recently and fell in love with it i loved the and the actors it has a little of everything i was completely taken by the of the story it has so many surprises along the way i highly recommend it in fact i loved it so much that i ran out and bought the book i felt i had to read it in order to appreciate the art in the writing behind the movie i also 
 i love this movie it has everything hunt did a job and in this film david is just plain hot and driver is as as ever combine all that talent with david allen carol robert and jim you have a worthy movie i 'm surprised they did n't get one if you have n't seen it go rent the watch it once then put directors commentary on hunt is 
 i have watched this film several times over the years and always find it an entertaining experience as a retired airline pilot i am interested in most aviation movies and this is one of the better ones i know that was only N years old at the time of his historic solo flight to paris and that james stewart was almost N when making this movie but i can that fact because stewart has always been one of my favorite 
 an the level of writing and acting in this australian movie is of the very best of old hollywood sam and are very good together matches line for line and take for take it is one of the best yet of his acting talent and he is at his and best notwithstanding the intensity of his role this film is a treat for any movie fan who a courtroom drama portrayed in the most human but terms the movie which 
 get out of sight brown and even N folks were finally getting leonard right making good movies out of his work so despite my students ' warnings about how bad this movie would be i could n't resist it i thought how bad can it be oy what a mistake especially right on the heels of reading the book which was and too too relative to the rest of leonard 's books still the book was better than the movie 
 oh my god after having such a promising start N reiterated the rule of what goes around comes around clearly very few things were thought out when this movie was made and what was up with scott wearing an this should have been the last into the but more garbage was on its way this was the big reason why i did n't watch N and why is every bad film series has to have an episode in space friday 
 this movie is a true it really is it 's rare you come across such a full of fun and with a little drama to keep you on your a true family film bound tells the story of three who set out to cross the rocky in an attempt to find their owners following the changes they go through and the obstacles they along the way one of the truly stunning things about this movie is its ability to give 
 october sky is a film that will steal your heart fill your mind with vivid and lift your spirit the tale of homer and his dream of creating a rocket seem so simple at first especially when the film is set in a mining town where the future is as clear cut as the of coal in the mine but homer can not follow in his father 's with the encouragement of miss a friendly teacher members of his father 
 i saw this movie on tv when it came out and never seen it again for the life of me i could n't remember the title and just across it while checking roy 's movie credits excellent dark and tv movie in the same class as farm do n't be afraid of the dark and 's school for all lost i also think it has many parallels to 's classic high plains why do n't they release these great little 
 this movie was so cool i saw it on a friday night with a couple of my friends while the first credits were rolling we saw that films had made this movie they are the ones that made that stupid movie wolf creek which was totally when we saw this we we thought it was going to be like wolf creek but we were so wrong the movie was not only better than wolf creek which really is n't that 
 i am a fan of both and but this movie is just not good the below is entirely correct that the stunning of the detroit station is the first and last scene in the film i really really wish i had left after that instead of continuing to hold out hope throughout the film maybe my expectations were too high but i felt let score is almost completely a of the previous two not necessarily a bad thing if you 
 this is your typical movie a bunch of characters out on some silly mission his signature has the entire cast of the film coming together and fighting each other in some crazy over hidden money whether it is a winning ticket in weekly black money in in etc. etc. the director is becoming predictable do n't get me wrong as and his movies may be i usually end up enjoying the comedy however in most his previous movies there has 
 i read the novel ' for the first time back in it was round that time that i saw the with timothy and it was an excellent version and very much like the book years later i laid eyes on this version and was william hurt is totally as rochester rochester is a character where as william hurt him as a block of ice the same goes for charlotte it was like watching two together this is story about love 
 the is one of the best love stories i have ever seen much better and deeper than 's & or 's 's love me every time her search her battle is becomes a strong woman throughout the movie is the of dark forces the temptation this story encourages me to fight like for the only one for the love of my life for right patience is one of the of this movie i cry every time when i realize all 
 what a wonderful film the script is nearly perfect it appears this is the only film written by i hope he has more stories in acting is as was amazing very natural talent and was a very as the old the was very effective without being overwhelming if only more movies like this were made whether in hollywood or hong a family friendly well acted well written well directed near perfect 
 this is probably the worst movie ever made it is just to bad the name of roger is associated with it i could 've understand it in his early years when he had lower budgets but there is no for giving birth to this i 'm a b movie and from certain people point of view all the i love are put aside by regular viewers but take my word on this one club makes the top of my list 
 if you read my review of 's you know that i can appreciate the that these movies can provide they 're stupid they 're silly but they 're still pretty fun in a so bad it 's good kind of way so still with for and recommending the i sat down to watch frenzy a original movie about a monster people on an island with the channel 's for creating features and a cast that includes william and hunter how 
 this is my first review on i did n't really want to write one but since there are only N for this great movie right now i feel to add my perspective and no i 'm not associated to the movie makers in any way how often did you here that before i 'm in my late of all i have to admit i really like movies because what you see is only limited by the of the and they 
 this is an extraordinary and douglas are good but them away he plays a man who must go against everything he thought was right bridges the film very well with a lot of tension the last of the films 
 as i drove from alaska to city a couple of years ago and was impressed with the i can not help but wish that this film even though it has beautiful color and views would have been shot in the actual location in the canadian is a place but still not the real place where the film takes place when the story moves to that is when i feel anthony who used the locations so well could have made the 
 this movie the difficulties that strain hopes dreams love and friendship and along with a stunning cast and brilliant the sound track and the atmosphere and mood of this work of art all actors and give an extremely good performance expectation in every way is brought on to the big screen for the first time in this film and she is the and that this movie is all about also works well with her and this is her best work 
 as the celebration of christmas has through the years whether one on the or the it is a time when people are supposed to a little better to each other that has somehow slipped past one merchant and money lender in century his points out to his uncle he does n't keep christmas in any way because feels the whole thing is the in was driven out long ago he 's a hard case a whole lot like his century 
 this movie me of harry not the style but the marketing strategy there may be part N part three until one day the product life cycle of course on the condition that the part one has a commercial success so many things seems to be hidden and thus the story looks quite incomplete the action design is boring set design is ok but not fine perhaps edison would be a big star one day he really looks even on big 
 i 'm writing this because i somehow felt being led to believe dark remains was a good movie it 's not the worst i 've seen it certainly is n't weak script weak actors and weak even if they ca n't afford big name cast would it be too much to ask for a more attractive lead actress it was painful to watch a plain actress through out the film with her performance the story was a and poorly the 
 i really enjoyed the first half hour of this movie but did it turn or should i say just plain stupid this is just another example of humor it might have been funny in N but not now not even is always interesting to watch i especially liked him once he started switching from his looks and high voice of the berkeley to where he 's mature and sounds it was fine as macdonald but the rest of the cast 
 the psychology of this movie is really weird to try and figure out its often billed as an movie but its really not that simple here are come apparent that make me wonder just what if anything they 're trying to say about introduce all the characters home lives by way of introduction all of them having parents who are and totally out of touch with their lives except for the times they 're them to succeed tom is the 
 i was n't really of the first movie it was a good idea but the acting and characters always kept me from it too much did n't really feel the need to see its but when i heard they were making a third movie that would act as more of a to the original i was thinking that maybe they would fix some of the original 's problems and provide us with a cast of characters well i thought wrong 
 this is a really nice and sweet movie that the entire family can enjoy it 's about two dogs and a cat who are taken away to live with someone else for a little while but the animals do n't understand and they escape and go to find the family on their own the cat is named sassy and she lives up to her name chance is the younger dog who knows a lot about life on the inside of 
 i 'm shocked that there were people who liked this movie i saw it at and most of the audience through it at scenes that were not meant to be funny i felt bad because the lead actress was in the audience but the plot to this movie needed major revision it did n't even make sense one second the characters question what exactly it is that they 're the next scene they 're and figure out how to make 
 great acting and greater special effects stars david one of my personal as decker it 's special effects on the were so good you thought they might be really however scored a perfect N on my list 
 before nicholas was a big action star he was a great actor this movie is where gives one of his best performances red rock west was a almost film but is one of my favorite movies of all time i discovered it walking down the video store and wanted to see and who also is great in the movie appear together go get this one and i 'm sure you wo n't be disappointed 
 i 've slowly been collecting the films available on of both and both actress and director have done some in their time fortunately is not one of to the soft skin 's sister the late this would have to be my well as also wrote the something that always strikes me about is his almost when a story one could almost call it 's a scene the end of the film where returns to the apartment in with the remains 
 most action films are of especially of and his family the film is typical type with big and film also has typical of many and a weird starting is and then the shift to is good but then the film goes on and on the of events move at a slow pace and nothing that great are many stupid scenes like the are shown like especially too is does an job music is only N song works and that is 
 there is a famous short story about a man who becomes the of a hunter who has lost interest in hunting anything except humans its quite good and its been done and in film and tv many many times some are notable but this version that the tired old themes just flat out 's is almost as weak as the script this guy is n't there must be people who find a who stop funny i mean i it is 
 i went into a of sister at the film festival and did not know what to was by the people in this sister is an incredible character the captured the of sister 's amazing soul and took me into a world unknown i was satisfied by the and was completely caught off guard by this film 's film speaks to those who desire a second chance at life 
 not since harold and has been so successfully used as the theme for a love story the acting by a top cast is with a well structured script things progress at an pace there are moments of black comedy but i would my as a unique romantic comedy with a touch of dark humor the relationship between two challenged is both and engaging the movie actually makes you question what is a normal relationship i highly recommend my seek it 
 this movie is a classic kids now will love it and people like me who were kids when it first came out still watch it for its value as well as for its humor and great story it kids to different and them to it 's not just a it 's a i love it 
 for a fan series i must admit that hidden is not at all that bad but reviewing this series can not be based on whether it is a fan series or not the initiative in itself is the creativity as well i these are people with ordinary jobs and a big enthusiastic heart for star but doing all this work pulling all these resources taking all this time and still all those of all the acting and the lines are 
 i think it 's about N years ago when i saw this movie i the for it here and immediately i felt good again i remembered seeing this movie and life again it showed me i could find love and i have a for a year and a half now and love is definitely there 
 east was a big disappointment for me but the thing about this movie is that it turned out to be john candy 's last film role he died just before shooting was completed on this there are only a few throughout this western and for a comedy that does n't cut it if you want to see a of western movies the answer is obvious see brooks ' classic or if you want to see candy in much better material 
 it seems that some viewers assume that the only thing which can make the dislike this movie is the violence in fact violence both disturbing and is the last of 's deep flaws the characters are the intensity an and a goal in itself with this director is served up with the cheapest of means let 's not a shot of with artistic worth by the end of the movie it seems that all the cards were exhausted so the 
 now this film is n't going to scare anyone but it was interesting for two reasons two big reason and a smaller well that 's three reasons is n't first reason this is interesting is the special effects i found them to be quite interesting and somewhat spectacular to see the hair growing on a. hunt and was especially when they were participating in a interest is the fact that this hunt is the famous brown sugar of the rolling 
 i must admit i was one of the skeptics who this show before relatively any information was about it i determined that it was going to be a cheap by ronald d. moore the was wrong the pilot leaves an excellent impression upon the viewers the is of course veterans will find themselves in the plot which is focused on the development of the before the first war N years before the events of the pilot the pilot also allows 
 though i saw this movie dubbed in french so i 'm sure it lost something in the translation lack of etc. it was an excellent fun movie for a night in a hotel room a real that portrayed accurately and the of individual role and finding a place within the communities to which one is supposed to belong male urban etc i was very proud of french television for showing such an honest and positive portrayal of the community while 
 where to begin how best to describe just how awful this movie is let 's start with the humor it is n't very funny add a bunch of musicians actors meat is horrible and harry is even worse poor art who should have known better than to do this then there is the plot a whose life goal is to work an alice show meets a girl whose life goal is to be a for alice at least they get 
 this is stuff my friends and i get together once a year to enjoy this movie its very funny and very dry i 've seen this move dozens of times and have yet not to enjoy actors are funny and it gets better with every if you enjoyed from out of space you will love this a great play on war of the i love the to get the aliens the on the the the heat seeking the mine field 
 even the for this movie makes me cry like the first time i saw this movie not for people who are easily upset by intense material the performances by alan and without a doubt this tale of a society with the power to and it 's citizens for any reason whether they are 's or the writer of children 's books will you to the bone i saw it when it first came out N and i remember every frame 
 just go see this movie it into everything about rock and roll the band comes up with some great pick of master etc all this with the humor of d makes this the best movie are great right of the back with meat and to ben and tim are great i really like tim character you also find out who really is the music and musical are and great from the who and others just complete it i personally did 
 brian what the hell were you on when you signed to do this i saw this recently at a festival and it was greeted by throughout by the time the credits rolled were down the faces of many of the audience the plot is a of ' ' and ' as aimed at the tv audience as is possible to get without being sued the involving the are both 's staging of the from the bed ' and mad george 
 yes a couple times and so did and most probably you will too the whole cast is back in action and has stepped up to become the true leader of this gang of i mean this in the best possible way i first thought maybe or were the main guys the main man is now do n't get me wrong everybody and i mean everybody is great in this right from the you 're laughing and believe you me do 
 i my head off because seeing this movie was my first movie going experience ever at some N months old i remember it being bloody and it made me angry i watched it again on tv a few years ago big mistake the acting is wooden the plot and the movie lacks merit unless N & a is what gets you going 
 i guess if they are not brother this film will became very common how long were they can keep this if we were part what should they do so natural feelings so plain and i almost last night blood relationship love another word the brother is very they are not brothers they wo n't have so many the hearts of their own at the very brother is doubtful of whether he is coming out or not at the beginning the 
 glenn ford a new york boy who has been saving his cash and his way to the arizona ranch he has bought where he hopes to find with a wire film with a script and story directed by and the frequently glenn ford and the richard just should n't be so bloody nice though the system mostly seen as mean and railroad bulls and real estate con men is as awful as one might expect from the mr. every single 
 think of this film as fan service a dream for the we start off with a which is pretty much unrelated to the rest of the film forward nine months and the real meat of the plot begins the lane is by every and in her school and gets invited to spend a weekend at a ranch by three guys who think they can get lucky and two with their weight and size so you have a bunch of young 
 i was not old enough to really appreciate the original but i knew everyone thought it was cool i have some of the books that were written based on the series in my collection and they 're pretty light duty so i did n't expect much from the movie that 's a good thing because this movie was bad on a long i the risk in creating a movie that is so completely true to the N 's hit the 
 i love this film khan 's portrayal as shut up robert was so whenever he got hit during a fight scene you could hear him is the robert i love that crime master 's double role is so for his portrayal as & and are out of this world my brother does a really good of saying relax please relax i love the scene in which khan puts a in khan 's food which caused the movements forcing him to 
 while not as bad as it has been made to be i have seen much worse this is still a very movie basically a of 's 's with the main difference being that 's hat has more than the whole of joe don baker an actor if there was is great and great fun as the bad guy sort of a budget he is the main reason to sit through this as the rest of the cast deliver mostly terrible 
 film critics of the world i it is your job to give advice to the public so that they can choose what to spend money on but i ignored your advice and i have been deeply hurt however my decision to see the cat in the hat was n't made you see three years ago all of you critics said that we should all avoid the known as how the christmas then some friends of mine took me to see 
 the death is truly a wonderful film labeled as a mean streets it has some really great stuff in it a lot of the stuff in this movie would later be used by himself including the actors joe frank vincent etc 
 for some reason jerry 's movies often seemed to come in for from certain quarters although they were rarely box office disappointments it 's one of life 's great to me because his films have always had a good ' factor about them for me but this film is not only not bad it 's an good and comedy to those who may be by ' crude or do n't see this film there 's nothing in it like that 
 i was looking forward to watching this film and was therefore extremely disappointed when i found it to be complete and 's direction is both heavy handed and how much more can you get than paris at night the male cast seems to have been chosen entirely for their to egon 's yet the themes of and which should have been the primary focus of a film of this type are left virtually what is left is a which takes 
 the only worth watching the best training ever the main character spending a hundred day 's on his outside the temple show how desperate he is to learn to fight the dogs who have taken over china 
 this movie a have been reading some of the other reviews apparently there are a lot of people that think that anything allen writes or stars in is automatically good i have watched several of his films in the hope that i 'm missing something but no they just poorly written trash the characters are all very not to mention rather stupid the plot is i think it is supposed to be not sure on that mr. allen 's character 
 this is one of the most brilliant movies that i have seen in recent times goes way above even any international movie of any i am really surprised why this has not received the recognition it winning the national award is perhaps the only fact simply as she speaks volumes through her eyes there are a few scenes that stand out when comes back from the city on 's she and meet for the first time in many years a 
 if you 're in the mood to at a truly bad movie bad in the way only ken russell at his worst can be you must try this one it succeeds in making you feel like you just landed in a and you can just about the on the floor turner around in a getting her from to be a hooker she really has a good solid job in the clothing industry and has been hurt so badly by men 
 peter sellers one of my favorite actors is mildly amusing in this N turkey but the script is so and that even 's youth just after her win can not begin to pull this one out of the as a in his N 's sellers mostly himself to the N out of best performance plays a young study hope and sellers were paid well because i see no other reason for like this in N a very good year for 
 what is interesting is that the acting was not bad just not enough it was rather special effects nor the lines were the single for this failure standing alone they were n't bad but put together was a move the show seemed long and slow with special effects apparently designed to speed the movie along but it failed of the blame for this disaster was put on special n't believe it they were cool was not the best choice for 
 johnson lives in a with her son her daughter cotton and her mother she 's in competition with a couple named and raymond mink david to be named the person alive the film shows their attempts to each film is very much not for everyone it 's a in your face no holds barred assault in bad taste has sex with a woman with a live chicken between them while his sister watches the pick up female them keep them 
 now i really liked this movie it was so and john are brilliant actors i think after watching this film they should do lots more films together in the gets himself into a bit of trouble by dating N women at the same time but the way he handles in when one comes out of the door and then the other one was just so funny to watch he acted really well his film and i hope that he makes 
 while to entertainment industry people or things or even brands of products is usually a in like this one they are n't used in quantity here most of the individual are rather generic as i 'm going to give examples there will be below there are only three well technically 's a quick one at the very end of the that i spotted which is kind of low for this type of short though one is a featured character with 
 this should not have been listed as a because in my opinion it does not resemble any of the other ever made this should have been listed as a movie peter and not playing the of because it does not do justice at all to our great

 i jumped at the chance to view this movie and and for it but wherever it seemed about to slip into being truly scary it backed off and went somewhere else the water throughout the house the black rain the dreams taking the wrong turn in raw were dropped before they could work up to a a disappointment 's nearly of a face offered little but confused something i found myself as the film wore on what could have been

 ok so after watching this movie and an hour and so many minutes off my life here is the basic summary comes out of boom box gives this kid with hair N wishes the kid his wishes on i forget what at and i guess mainly i i but mainly i at the comedy that came from the wonderful acting skills of an and boy with highly recommend this movie for college kids sitting around drinking some beers with their 
 the first one was different and funny this attempt should have never left the studio this movie does not make you it is a weak attempt at gross out humor the movie picks out current and old movies to this time the jokes seem used and the audience that i saw it with only to dinner scene and was otherwise 
 first the an excellent job at urban to suit the mood of the film some of the shots could be paintings by de the stories are hard to believe characters and posture N of the time as if they were in some kind of this is neither the of his earlier much better movies nor the we 've all come to know and appreciate is excess in this movie 
 this film the days to glory is the acting is awful it is far too and its historical is not always at its best would have a field day it does have a few good moments but not enough to keep interest because it is far too long rating out of

 possible in some way how to friends is the loser to adjust becomes successful and finds out that something else matter more type of story in the celebrity business end of i do n't know the original book but this comedy several good moments though i do think the ending is flawed it felt too fast and too abrupt as if something was missing besides i 'd say the movie is n't able to keep a high level apart from 
 i saw this film on september N in indianapolis i am one of the judges for the film festival that screens films for their truly moving picture award a truly moving picture the human by hope and respect for the positive values of life gave that award to this is a story of golf in the early part of the century at that time it was the game of upper class and rich and working people could only participate by 
 edgar rice 's famous character was adapted thousand of times for the screen one 's is notably during the and the by hollywood its made one of the most successful characters several years later hudson decided to make a more ambitious version of the and it 's a more natural more wild and more that he gives away here hudson the that you usually grant to such as his famous or his friendly pet not only are we far from 
 i wanted to watch this to get a inside look at the show it told the story more of robin williams then & still thought it was great we got to see robin always being ' no matter what the performance of was of the main players seem so real to me roebuck as marshall was wonderful he was so in this which helped me get through all the williams energy the little behind the scenes pieces of his other 
 people get a clue i mean the writers have one so i would expect you to this show is such a pale of the show that you can at it and the show is the one with the cheap special effects and is in b & yet the mood and the writing on the old show is miles ahead of this get kids if N degrees or told you to watch it you would you know it just them and 
 just got out of an advance and was this movie possibly better than the first one but at least its equal if you do n't like or really unnecessary amounts of male way more than in the first then stay far far away but if you dig the whole thing then this movie will not is the greatest ever so my review was n't long enough all else i have to say is poor poor dunn they really kick the 
 batman the mystery of the is about as entertaining as batman movies still true to the feeling of the comic books the is done with a lighter spirit than in the series bruce wayne looks much like he has before but now he appears somewhat less imposing the dick robin has been replaced by the less more tim as usual the voice of batman better than most live action did a much more decent job than i was in the 
 michael usually appears in either very good blame it on without a clue or truly bad off death becomes her harry & walter go to this falls into the latter is a comedy that succeeds in only two things managing to waste a cast that includes and all of which have and succeeding in its mission not to make the there is n't a single truly funny moment here the main reason is the script there was so much effort 
 craig brewer is now officially a for whom i will see any film by no matter how bad it may look his debut and flow was one of my from that year with its charged and realistic characters i was n't quite sure what i would end up thinking after seeing this effort the cast seemed great the used music effectively however it seemed like there was a good chance it would cross into and fast fortunately black hits all 
 i hope the who machine ' as one of 's and the best movies of the century was on my part i hope so dream machine ' marks the first of a long line of that would the rest of 's career except of the ' which was surprisingly decent here plays college boy who that a cool car will attract his dream girl 's attention lucky for a rich woman aiming to get back at her cheating husband hastily 
 as you may remember i have seem all three of the of trash and the first movie is the only one even close to be part two was low grade and this installment is slightly better then two but still one pile of something i removed from my last monday the does n't make sense why did the murder that poor old lady and even in N i think someone would notice a bunch of guys where a sweet little 
 i love watching australian movies but this pile of was just plain embarrassing the cover looked promising but you know what they say do n't judge a by it 's cover i also noticed that it won best actor for an award but the competition must have been really bad because the acting in this film is it just seemed that the director thought he had enough talent to direct and act when he should really focus on one part 
 its great not to have to wait for the next convention to see its a film by a bunch of with no budget but a good way to spend an hour they got most of the special effects right the is classic and it just feels right for a 
 when it comes to political movies i usually come out feeling empty they generally take up some stance and you have a clear good bad story line as if it is some sort of batman with it is the first movie i 've seen that showed politics for what it is and the real issues of trying to rule a country of broken people who have known no other rule but violence there were no good or bad there were 
 i have never posted a review before but i had to do it for this film this film is so bad i found myself trying to justify how bad it is by trying to think of it as or but it is n't it is truly bad this is a serious attempt that other have pointed out the film 's many flaws so i 'll try not to repeat these but i do urge you to see this film throughout 
 i saw this originally on channel N and it was a film that left a great impression on me however i saw it on irish tv recently and there was an added by roy we 're going to need a bigger boat this the film for me his adds absolutely nothing to the film and if anything takes from the films i wonder at the new version that has no roy due to legal reasons would stop people from buying 
 as with some of the best films and series i across this quite by accident it was late a storm was in full force outside and i was sitting on the when i past a channel that was just about to show one of the episodes i intended merely to watch a couple of minutes while waiting for the commercials to be finished on another channel before switching back to some or other about an hour and a half later 
 i remember i saw this when i was N or my picked up the video of it for free at the mall i remember that it really the plot had no sense i the fox that became 's friend he was so stupid his head off if he could n't find a friend so what get over it the only good part and i do n't want to sound was when the fox got shot and died at the end 
 i do n't know why this conduct was ever in the movie business this movie short is gross to say the least it is a bunch of year old children wearing with big bobby acting like adults and too much so however it is interesting because it is a good example of how the good old days may not have been so good after all god we have laws against this kind of material now this is one short from 
 nothing short of in this film the fact that you keep seeking and hoping for more flying tells you that they have just enough the acting is the stories are together and the dogs are a must rent view or n't be afraid of its worth a little 
 the core meets crack in the world N made for tv the acting is stock the predictable once you all of the plot off from the core basically the drilling machine you end up with the plot of crack in the world crack was a truly excellent movie his team of scientists working in south africa down to the and through with a nuclear device in order to provide a steady source of energy one of his subordinates also a 
 if christopher had made before following then all of the flaws in following would have been corrected in constructed the switches in time perfectly we were able to tell when it was the past when it 's current etc however with it a little and it just does n't work although he had a small budget and could n't use color which is one way worked it was just too hard to between time on the is a feature that 
 his index finger in 's leg wound and keeps it there until he gets what he wants funny so the invented takes the dozen for a ride and sometimes it to pay to other movies lots of fun even paris when it is mentioned in a organic piece of i was by 's character and by his performance creates a true original i love the actor 's lack of there 's a in the character that is pure visits a 
 i first read about the left behind series a few months ago and made a mental note to check it out since i have an interest in the way is used to control people in our ever more hate filled world so imagine my surprise and when i found a copy of left behind world at war in my local library among the big budget action as a movie it 's extremely poor the acting is straight out of an 
 johnson is good as the michael is good as though it 's his usual and and not a patch on his king john reads the well as laurence though he never takes it anywhere alan is good as in the first of his roles that would make him famous christopher 's is sets are pretty if not stunning as in some of the other that 's it the rest is weak to turned N during production and has n't a 
 i saw this film on television and by the beauty of it was a neat film and you can watch it for the beauty of africa and of course at that time i was watching this movie and from then i am trying for of this film but i am unable to find it huge african makes appearance his film and we will be simply by the size of those animals and grace of them all section of audience can 
 what starts out as conflict in this movie ends in understanding and grace the movie through europe with the father and the young son in a car over N miles the forces and life skills to there 's really no clear winner it all adds up in the end as experience experience of multiple of life for those interested in understanding this movie offers a generous and outlook without being about the agenda it 's a coming of age story 
 the is a weird little canadian at first it would appear to be just another cheap extremely cheap but enough it also shares some with the original which had n't even been released yet when appeared N who knows anyway the story is thus scientist carl lehman seems to be a pretty nice guy who works for a secret government high-tech research lab reporting to a boss named whom he heads with about project funding early in the movie carl 
 to my surprise i quite enjoyed ' i remember seeing it about N years ago and recently i hired it again i was quite impressed obviously the special effects in space films such as and deep impact are far superior to those in however this film had a a very story where you could almost the next line of dialogue before hearing it but what i liked about they do n't make films like this anymore so it was a 
 sure was a good movie the first time you see it but you really should see it a second time and your opinion of the film will change the first time you see the movie you see the underlying and think how romantic the second time and i am not the only one to think this it is just and you just sit there watching the movie thinking when is this d ship going to sink and even this is 
 this movie is a of two movies that were a lot better the last one can wait was great i suggest you see that one this one is not so great the last third of the movie is not so bad and chris rock starts to show some of the comic fun that got him to where he is today however i do n't know what happened to the first two parts of this movie it plays like some really 
 this review may contain or maybe not the warning is the same for all it just when i thought that channel had used all of its ridiculous ideas for movies they give us this actually the plot itself it 's nothing we have n't seen in movies like on a plane deep blue sea etc that means a of some kind is in a close environment threatening a bunch of people in this case an in a train must say 
 i like this episode quite a bit ruth gordon is good if not a little as she always was as has been stated the music is very good and it has a that does n't exist in all one major plot hole exists so wide you can drive a fleet of trucks through it it is established that the light does n't work in the vault do n't you think that the very or the rest of the police would 
 oh what a disappointment this movie is i ca n't believe it was directed by there 's practically no plot and N of the movie consists of various people walking in and out of the screen trying to with each other while talking about the massacre the most interesting part comes right at the end but by that time i simply stopped while trying to my the entire movie is with a hand-held camera which is supposed to convey the 
 a is on the side of the road making sure is the speed limit doing his job he then pulls over a woman who appears she is a mother there is a child in the back seat he then is telling her what is wrong and they get killed this is the start of what i personally thought would have been a good movie when i was watching this movie in the theatre i was with some friends this was 
 is this the movie is this what indians are trying to show i think this is one more effort from a director to turn down soldiers and in fact country but what we 's know that we are always ahead of india in every part of our lives not only in armed this is bad as that of border in early N and director and writer just tried to overcome a shame of defeat in by armed forces by creating 
 no the of might at a first make you think that this is just another school well it 's not the setting just happen to be a school environment this is a comedy but a very smart one with a lot of and the characters does have a psychological which is almost in the same class that can be found in the works of the episodes is aired as it seems out of order the pilot is in fact episode 
 i 've always loved gone with the wind and have seen it numerous times however its ending left me not only hanging but depressed with a feeling finally in took us to a very and satisfying end beginning of the original follows that someone of 's obvious intelligence as originally written would eventually grow up although like most people i fell in love with in i tired of her constant to the point of and i was disappointed that mitchell 
 evil aliens owes a huge debt to peter early films bad taste and must to never enjoying those films particularly and i say the same about west is a director who clearly lacks of his own and chooses to steal from those whom he looks up lost count of the amount of times a major hollywood film was quoted most notably james amount of blood and on show here is n't funny either the latter end of the film becomes 
 we 're both around together in this world whose rules and objectives are largely unknown seemingly or even possibly always on the verge of being killed by forces that we do n't understand so says ted in the film which for some people sums up life and ' probably is a film about existence what is real and what is and how you tell the difference or not the last line of the film is film seems like a dog 
 i just watched this movie for the first time after finishing the book last week what 's the problem here folks admit that the performances are great i mean is and that the film is but it 's got less than a ' i do n't get it come on the writing 's not that bad having read a lot of novels and having seen a lot of the films based on them i think a job was done in 
 the plot has something about white captured by a tribe of white women in the african a turkey and the some what it really is is wildly from early sound and silent films mixed with badly shot recent to the release of men on a there are scenes of a man in a suit south at sea used to represent people in the middle of africa women in 's horrible and a guy in a with make up all over

 i totally agree that the kill what could otherwise be a great show i 'll admit that i 'd seen N or N episodes last season and was not clear at all that it was all but when i caught one episode recently it suddenly jumped out at me big time and i lost interest immediately then i noticed the at the start before an episode that followed has anyone followed the show closely enough to tell me did they 
 the first five minutes of this movie showed potential after that it went straight from something possibly decent to some sort of comedy the best part is that i could n't stop thinking of thanks to i would recommend watching this movie for the sheer fact of learning how not to make a movie there are so many scenes in this movie that makes one just stop and wonder if the entire cast and crew just stopped at some point 
 first of all the big named actors must need the money the surgical scenes were and surely they must know that people who have a little knowledge of medicine would find this utterly absurd do not leave the room during a heart transplant nor do they do the surgery in a tiny room of instruments heart lung equipment and techniques just a joke could n't concentrate on the story line because of all the stupid surgery scenes no blood no 
 this film was made years before i was born but i still think it is the most piece of fun ever made it simply could not go wrong with the cast of british character actors it to start margaret the innocent played to by the grenfell the victor a guy special and the rest of the staff sum up middle-class england to a is sometimes obvious but it is of that special variety and is never have watched this film 
 god for and the high speed of it 's fast forward even with that i could n't sit through any more of that when they came across the old indian asking for i gave up and erased it is this the best that channel can come up with for saturday nights how about some old instead the idea of a special forces unit was bad enough it seems like they wanted to save money by having everything out in the

 this movie describes a truly event to be sure but it all falls down from poor performances from all the cast it is impossible to feel the of almost any character as all the emotional scenes seem like of themselves for example a character is shot at the start of the movie and you get the desperate am i make it it ai n't nothing ' but it plays out like a from a brothers movie i do n't know

 this movie took the jerry approach to power wilder is the kind of movie that i love addressing the idea that in america are defined either by their gifts or by attempts to hide them at the same time the movie points out that every is only human and no more to be feared or than any other human being this was a great comedy fun and human with that slight edge 
 this was truly horrible bad acting bad writing bad effects bad bad camera shots bad bad characters bad music bad bad casting bad bad well you get the idea it was just just what 's the word oh bad

 i recall seeing this film on tv some years ago and not paying full attention maybe even missing the first half so i came to the conclusion that it was and over rated i decided to it last night to see if i had missed anything the first time i certainly did this is one of the most disturbing and amazing films of all time and it has clearly had much influence on films today and probably will forever i

 i am as many are a fan of tony scott films when this movie came out i had high hopes that it would be like on fire ' to find out that the movie it 's the thing from it the story was water from the get go and the choice of was not such such a good idea and the whole was too the movie is centered around and this movie reveals that she 'll never become a movie 
 the movie is an of a japanese story by the respected author it simply does n't make the transition into a credible story about and story moves especially the part where miles and are and the director in with the shots of a ship 's cutting through the waves and the little route line filling in on the while their letters are heard in the film moves so that i even through the sex and scenes which although long are

 i had the greatest enthusiasm going in to the advance for this movie after all this is one of the oldest and most complex known to and it was one of the first i read as a kid even before i must say that it was a huge disappointment they completely made the plot into a joke and turned the thing into one long soap opera the elements that were to the plot were throughout in such a manner that

 well first off the are exactly the same there is no one is and one is is than though and their are n't even french so that is bad because they are the it is also not that bad not their best i am a big and fan do n't get me wrong the is ok and it is funny to watch it is not the type of movie that you would watch over and over again but when they 
 all i can say about this movie is it is absolutely boring the to the movie is quite possibly the worst to a film i have ever seen i mean a angry hitting a guy in the head with a pan is n't at all which is what i assume the director was aiming for but in fact it was mildly funny the acting in this picture was beyond a note to directors if your making a film please hire 
 some might remember if having seen the film a scene where page has a moment of for 's her favorite film 's character then asks if she 's ever seen a gordon lewis film and to he has a copy of a movie i forget which at the moment and shows it to her at the time i saw i had seen and a few films but not lewis now i can see that it 's not just another one 
 great chris has got to be the best williams that i have every seen he acts it up perfectly this was like watching williams as he really was and is it almost made me cry watching had no idea that robin was as close a friend to john as he was the portrayal of this relationship was very good and could almost stand on it 's own merits very sad what both of them went really felt for both and 
 it 's reassuring to see that other have had the good sense to pan this disappointing film at the risk of against the great and directors may be & artistic in their own right however in attempting to pass off this of attempted and as in any way related to edgar allen 's stories they exposed themselves as either a they did n't bother to read the stories or b they read them but were so by their own agenda 
 this movie is kind of good it seem that they used the like a up balloon just like just maybe back in those 's days scientist have n't got enough on all sorts of back in those time scientist still making so i guess this movie was base on a movements back in the 's there even a part where a giant rock fired by someone at the it damage the and it was knock out for a little while 
 first of i should point out that i used to love the as a child and i really enjoyed the movie even though i am in my this movie was so bad i was to have been a fan in my ok i know this is a movie for kids and is n't aimed at people like me anyway but this is my thoughts on the movie for other people of my main in this film is the itself it 
 welcome to the world of the man who was once successful and got several hits with small actors like and also the and his one film with peak about this films are that all are hollywood and some decent ones like the once which is a of cellular and that too a terrible one a look at the stars we have the once but now out of work and then we have the khan and film could be a decent 
 i really do n't have any complaints about this movie except for the disturbing scenes with the body i fell upon it while switching around the tv one night the acting was actually amazing i did n't expect it to be better than it appeared i thought 's who looks the same since N which is a very good thing acting was really great and played his character perfectly this movie is a hidden its a fresh of reality to 
 this movie definitely shows something and light on what happens in most institutions today and shows how one just with the help of her newspaper manages to get things done her editor has complete faith in her and does n't publish something important because it would harm her friend and when it was the right time she took the necessary movie overall got a rating of N from me because its got everything i mean it keeps you and moreover 
 i 'm here again in your local shopping mall of course that 's where the high school kids hang out to demonstrate how awful really is to prove how bad this joke of a this is we 're going to take these four and stuff them into this photo how how awful is it it 's so bad disney channel away its money yet again with those exciting yet determining keeping the viewers wondering when is this going to be 
 the second not movie about the only people still refusing to surrender to the roman empire is even more than the first film & the first movie got all the because all were so perfectly brought to life without losing their identity this which is a separate story as are all the is even better sure all the that you find in the first movie and in the are present again is still dying to taste the magic that gives 
 if only all was this great this film is classic because it is strong is two simple aspects story and character the characters in this film are i felt for all of the characters and relationship in the movie works perfectly the beautiful and computer has n't worked better in any other film this is a great movie for kids and for adults who want a classic hero 's N of N 
 this movie is very great the acting is fine with excellent casting of as the who out and his patients in the beginning he sees his wife with the and then he goes crazy he also takes on his wife and the the patients he the most special effects are also beautiful although some are really fake like a that has laid for N night outside and is still red in the morning but the scenes are absolutely though this 
 the best screen version of ever made well the plot is not so strong and evident as in the book sometimes and its among but the film is really and strange has an and style that other versions with and the new one from poland definitely lack it has the air of roman the beauty of declining and at least i believe it has and did excellent job in portraying their characters 's seems to be the biggest success of 
 this is a story about who moves to from seoul with her young son to start over after the death of her husband her husband was born here and she is opening up a piano school but also has ambitions to own some land with the insurance money she received from the death if that is what the film was about it probably would have been like a hollywood film with her falling for some local guy and being happy 
 what i found so about this film i saw the full N hour version is how oddly it is for a film about N very men and engaged in a political struggle it 's almost totally of emotional fire the scenes between del and who is at best a second level actor with a slightly high pitched voice have no drama or and basically come down to telling go here go there do this and that with no explanation as 
 shame is rather unique as a war film or rather quite the film in that it not only does n't focus on the soldiers or politics involved there is politics but not how you 'd think it 'd be shown it deals with its two main subjects as the only two beings that can possibly be about at all in this society they in the midst of his prime and following two other heavily psychological films and hour of the 
 certainly is n't your average run of the mill and that 's no bad thing unlike his previous effort the fifth which was your ' 's film almost all of the and instead of murder the focus is very on psychological mystery it 's obvious from the outset that this is going to be an entirely bizarre film as the film opens up with a scene set on the moon things do n't get any after that as the turns 
 god i suffered having to watch this film four times in my house and was it a story of sex and guns and very cheap acting unless you are at being told to watch this avoid it rule just proved he can not act also gave the most acting ever in any of his films there was not one part of this film made me or make me jump or feel any i would be surprised people actually enjoyed this 
 i felt to give some on this movie that i from blockbuster this movie has it all comedy drama crime and movie also had a lot of action with just the right amount of humor i will definitely watch it again there were some funny parts as well as drama i enjoy movies that keep you wondering what 's going to happen should make more movies in my overall opinion this movie was great i 'm looking forward to his 
 after having seen mafia i 'd nearly lost my faith in korean movie business but this one brought my faith female character who is university student forced to teach the rich but high school student guy he is actually female character 's age through some these two end up being great was surprised that sang woo did his job with he was such a actress kim was also as movie tried hard to avoid any that can be seen in 
 this one what came to my mind immediately was as it has this same kind of mature mood and dealing with the subject we simply as the story without taking sides or having to any moral issues or of course we are but are not them sure there were some difficult facts to face and choices to make but it just basically it was just like any other love story in any other life with any other personally found the 
 october sky is a highly movie and easy to see why the story is easy to and many turning points are the actors and do fairly good jobs especially and chris the hero finally gets what he wants and a true story frankly i think the achievement is not comparable to the and heat the original story generates we see any special or the power of the movie relies much on the plot and tough situation the young hero is 
 well i gave this movie a it was better than but not as good as in the beginning as far as the movies go i really think the television series did a much better job overall with the special effects and character portrayal let 's hope the producers and cast get the next series crusade up to the standards of 
 though structured totally different from the book by tim who wrote the original ' it does have the same overall feel except for that 's style is less and more the beginning is great the middle is fine but the is in the end a surprise emotional ending as you could read in several magazines there is some sex in the film but it is done all very never explicit but with lots of and sometimes even it is a 
 jeff wanted to makes fun of so built a movie around a similar to it the twist is that instead of old l. ron hubbard as the leader there 's a centuries old space monster who turns his into our hero is a living college student who is doing research into the his is an attractive who tries to get him to clean up his life with the help of the it does n't take him long to figure out 
 this is the first james film i have ever really watched i was never interested in his movies before because i figured i would n't like anything in that style of and because i 've heard most films are the same i have to say i really liked it by today 's standards for movies it was not special but i found it surprisingly entertaining did not have the look of a tough guy but he played the part very 
 this is unfortunately 's last recorded hbo concert from a series that lasted over N years though this may not be his best work it is excellent funny and thought this recording is also a bit different from most of his other that it is a bit than most of his other his long and influential career has moved from the more humor and jokes a more ' viewpoint of society and culture his focus on the english language and 
 not surprised that even get the blues if this movie is anything to go by i expected something better from which was the reason i suffered my way through this experience in the first place an awful film with only the music as a quality just a shame that we are of giving N out of N in these reviews this movie deserves it 
 right up or down there with toys and park N and the sounded cool some of the commercials looked but the entire movie had about N seconds of neat and that was shown on the small screen 's N second you want writing effects ridiculous and an by all means watch it the plot is recycled too bad too because coming in i thought it would be bad but held out hope it may be the worst movie i have 
 forget the fact that most people expect an action movie form this movie simply had no substance very long drawn out and boring scenes were much longer than they had to be the camera would often focus on something for long periods of time when absolutely nothing was happening cure for worst movie by far i do like some of his other movies 
 i a copy of this one from big mistake the version titled the was produced by who thought that the fighting would be better all together in one big chapter than as part of a consistent story some of the story was left in separate which you can select from the main but the is still a mess do n't rent or buy it not that there was anything wonderful about the original story an complicated piece of nonsense much 
 in ten words or less to describe this film barbara is too appealing and it is great the film is wonderful except for the perhaps ending but i love happy anyway barbara however as the is amazing she knows what she wants and goes after it this film is and excellent 
 and now for another point of view i did n't like it i did n't finish it in fact i know that is ranked by some as one of the greatest ever made i know that it stars and was directed by one of the of american i know that it won a bunch of still i did n't like it i do n't like and that 's clearly a matter of taste but i also do n't 's acting 
 although at times i was the only one in the who was laughing this is the main pleasure i took from the shot although sometimes it seemed that the movie had an identity crisis and did n't know whether it was a tragedy or a comedy the of black through at regular it helped of course that it the standard of acting by everyone concerned was wonderful and that i was slightly by the at times leading lady who was 
 hope with bullock is a real disappointment the story starts off her husband on her and she finds out on national television so she has to rebuild her life here it could have gotten interesting or built up in a story line but you become so with it she moves back with her parents and harry jr. who plays justin begins hitting on her the two have no real chemistry at all yet your supposed to get the impression that 
 paul and master film maker strikes back with the less than perfect yet still fun in a old man type of way man the first two acts are so good that the final act yet i am giving a recommendation to this film for it 's mind special effects perhaps the best so far around and two performances by the leads 's moral questions are of course thought and although the film turned off many this movie is pretty for 
 not only do the in the engage audiences from all over but i think for me at least what brings the viewers back is the acting not even you gary can dispute that claim james who plays the tony has become in this 's opinion one of the hollywood as far as acting in a television series goes i would n't go ahead and compare him with robert or al or at least not just yet he however does do 
 why on earth should you explore the nature earth how much time do you have on earth so i can explain this to you ok i will not my review exploration on earth to but i must stand my ground on why this is a must see the takes a nature round trip on the on three animal families a female bear and her cubs with the real life of the father bear it out to hunt for food in 
 i 've seen better movies in my time this one however takes the more comedy than full moon high puts the c in the star quality in this movie is not bad just the way it was made just sends in rolling plays tony an high school football player of the N 's who ends up not aging due to a in the most part of the movie was the violin player he drove everyone ed plays his father who 
 probably the best movie in N years there 's been attempts to make you scared when all they make you do is walk out of the theater and movies that just should n't have been made but this one is worth it the only reason i did n't give it a N is because paris hilton is in it but her death scene makes up for it believe me so here they are the of all the death scenes in 
 this impossible tale is of a female pursuing a man in a world her community is open among it 's members but she her from the this is starting to sound familiar it 's not your typical movie very performances by jack and keep things from getting kim is always a pleasure on screen but i found her with james stewart unusual but not fatal to the story interest in all things and dark this film deserves to be discovered 
 the woman in black is easily one of the british ghost stories ever young after in a small town to handle a dead client 's estate is by a woman dressed all in film is loaded with extremely atmosphere and the are calculated for and deliver the maximum effect action keeps the deeply involved and the is quite acting is excellent and the tension is almost at if you want to see a truly film give this one a anyone 
 first off i am critical of this movie because i really had high hopes and instead this movie possible if you have n't seen the tv series where to begin well let 's start at the quality the movie was barely better than the original tv series and the two fight scenes were very however the was there is the plot and questions that still remain after the whole movie is all said and done this movie does not close 
 N years since this show was made and it is still is the best show ever made the writing was class and the production second to none this show would never be made today and that this a shame i hope if you are thinking about finding this show to watch that you do ag came out the year i left high school at the time my tv show was the x files this gives you an idea of why 
 a band of five young american men all that is left of a hit hard during the offensive during the get the as a forward and to look for enemy activity they 're in really bad condition both and and think they have struck gold when their is in an abandoned but once mansion full with food but after a while there is some enemy activity and it is very odd not hostile but odd it seems like there is 
 walter is wonderful as the dr. whose frequent to girlfriend provide proof of the dangers of lying 's simmons certainly to win her 's work as the is also to watch as she comes out of her shell slowly and nervously this is a great movie to watch in the or any time for that matter it 's very i never heard about it until i found it in the video store and what a find 
 it 's probably a year since i saw but it has left strong memories of the two main characters and his from the village 's a long film with very little dialogue and a quite limited plot this has a fair few viewers but the film such a painfully portrait of and that there 's just as much emotional tension as in the to be clear there 's no in this film in the long where no one speaks there 
 when i noticed that was being broadcast in the united states i was i then had the to watch the thing i m. c. 's books about the wonderful scottish the characters in the book are entertaining and very the powers that be who are responsible for this apparently have never have read one of 's books only the name has anything to do with the series besides the lack of familiar characters i find the whole show loud it 
 watched N out of N effort by ted turner 's feature group plays a lot like tv and leaves a lot to be in the area of characters but has extremely i 'm not even sure why the kids would like this movie because there are so many to old movie stars that kids know very little or nothing about effort at best despite on the box it to disney efforts like and lion king do n't let this fool 
 have n't played the game do n't bother this is for the final fantasy fans out there that beat the game and no other will appreciate this rare of a movie want to watch it and love it buy the game beat it and then watch it when 's the last time you 've seen an excellent movie based on a video game well this is story takes place two years after the game and no short are given to 
 of all arnold 's movies who would have thought that most relevant today would be the running man a and surprisingly realistic tale of reality tv gone mad it may have been back then but not so now not when you think about it currently reality tv shows are either the bottom of the barrel or desperate to raise the bar if the next one is n't more controversial as the last it 's a how long will it be 
 i went in to see on a and with very low expectations the movie failed to meet do n't mind stories that stretch remember of fire but i do expect them to be consistent this film from to without for breath all with special effects that lagged far behind the likes of or even from korea into a dealer and up like to get the out of their latest mess a special agent from the fbi who seems to be 
 basically this movie is one of those rare movies you either hate and think borders on as the next best thing to do rather than having to sit through it for two hours or as in my case you see it as a hit one of those movies the the plot the acting is actually very hidden but for those of us willing to go looking for it the director well the reward is u your a of the fact 
 this short is a words fail me here as this is almost technically after more than N years the are remarkable and even occasionally amazing this is not something you watch if you like things that are mundane or it most certainly is not either this be an odd one gang well worth checking out but if things like and make your head hurt you may want to this recommended 
 my mom and i went to the worth premiere mainly to see george but ended up getting the chance to see the movie premier at bass hall what a wonderful beautiful film which not only the beautiful texas landscape but also had a great it was well written directed and produced and my mom and i loved it from start to finish you jay for giving us the opportunity to be a part of the premiere of this wonderful movie 
 this is a great example of what happened at comedy central after dave left here 's the problem with carlos his birth name is and was known that until he was N when he switched his name to he was born in honduras though he acts like he 's from mexico he grew up in the united states as might be able to all that but he 's been caught stealing other peoples material joe has been his most critic 
 i want to state first that i am a christian and that i do work in the film and tv industry so i understand what it is like to work on a feature length film so to the in that regard i 'm all for positive messages if they are true to the nature of life that this is a fallen world and that things do n't always work out even for of i 'm glad that others are having 
 the shop around the corner is one of the great films from director ernst in addition to the of james stewart and margaret it 's filled with a cast of top character actors such as frank morgan and 're the type of character actors that hollywood no longer employs in fact the film itself is the kind of movie that hollywood does n't make anymore the makers of you 've got mail claim their film to be a but that 
 surely one of the of the modern world this film is not considered to be within the top N films of all time if you watched this film and thought it was anything other than wonderful please let me know how al 's performance is as good as it gets 
 gene never let his fans down his death ended that will never be matched earth the final conflict was proof his pilot film and the first N seasons were well written and produced but somewhere along the way the touch was lost the loss of lead kevin william boone definitely hurt the series as he was a vital part of what made it work the story involves the human race being visited by the an race who themselves ' after 
 let 's be fair there are no rules for so i wo n't say the movie should be something other than it is i 'll just state my opinion ok i really liked the script the way things are told and characters are introduced however i think when a play is adapted to the silver screen it could maybe try and fit this other media since this movie was directed by the same man who directed the play it 's 
 some N year like coping with the death of a high-school trying to find their purpose in live and love the script is so that i had to force myself to even finish this movie stay away from it 
 i thought this movie was brilliant it was so funny and so true too a great idea for a movie five groups of friends on their way to i 've got to say that as mason was probably my character i wish i could give this movie more than a N rating

 one can only hope that there are many times when someone as powerful as morgan freeman can take the time to assist someone who needs all comes down to people as will rogers said i never met a man i did n't like of course if you meet what 's not to like that of can diamonds she is just so that i can watch anything she is in the same goes for freeman he is just magic on the 
 this was recently on 's movie and i had to i had high hopes for this that follows in the of to the earth 's core and island i was disappointed not only in the acting credentials but in the silly story line that reads from a five year old 's comic book be sure to catch sight of the wires that are holding on to the 's wings when they grasp a half man who the lost the ending 
 in at an three hours and minutes is a pretty but comic soap opera from india that us with six of romantic love which is at least four too many in my like a cross between an music video and a bowl beer commercial the movie is a of exotic colors numbers dream and fantasy character dialogue and performances all pretty much stuff when it comes to these days it 's an just trying to keep all the characters straight 
 yes my summary just about tells it you have n't watched this try it but not for pleasure for studies of one of the worst examples of trying to be politically correct and cool at the same men always think they know everything are stupid and finally loose to the women etc this is especially offensive when all the characters are just as terrible and i mean ok was funny one time or another but unlike other stupid characters like 
 director writer michael winner 's feature is a better than expected film although still efficiently for which really does by go sure it might borrow ideas from other similar movies of this period but still manages to bring its own psychological to the material of good vs. evil and a unique vision that has a fair share of if somewhat as a whole it 's however remains intriguing by an charge without going with the actually there 's always something 
 i 've seen this film in at festival in saw the first four years ago and from this moment i was waiting to see the final result i have n't been is a full movie with a high black and white clearly inspired by some comic books such as the ones from f. miller in this it goes one step further than the excellent city from r. this time almost no grey or any middle color but a style never 
 who played the blind in a total of N movies ends the with this excellent film in which he gets to make love to a ghost blind big stick used often in the pursuit of justice is retired was his usual as he pursued those who would steal from the treasury to lend at amounts to those who could not afford to usual amazing and of the big guy was present along with the 'm going to miss him 
 an interesting concept turned into my first seeing feature from wright when i first took interest in it it seemed at the time an interesting concept film setting very odd mixed that turned into a piece of that gives my country a bad name pros of a good cast and stupid plot camera much variety of locations use of australia 's worst attempt of a film stick to or warning that film is dangerous 
 ok i know that a lot of people will probably this review as down is a classic and a standard part of most people 's but seeing this film for the first time at the tender age of N i must admit i really watched this film because my sister had read the book and really enjoyed it and many people who at the very words down their memories of seeing the film as children and having their torn at 
 this movie kind of me of a and worse just the rich kind of thing i think even though more the actress in this movie was sometimes but acting i think that after high-school musical they needed to come up with better and this definitely was n't it the story line was n't that great and i think they should have gotten two other people to play taylor and i 'm not a big fan and this movie did n't 
 i have always been a fan of bottom as many as i could find of the series here in the states the chemistry between and is always and the combination of smart writing and utterly stupid humor seems to work without fail i thus sat down to watch this movie with great eagerness and was utterly disappointed by the first of the movie can best be described as and poorly directed sorry but with some utterly brilliant moments unfortunately these 
 i just realized why the colors and sets in were so flashy and and just painful to look at the story is about a known as an in japanese their were always and than other so that the would stand out but the director had to make sure that the director stood out even more than the main character or even the story what did in the movie just gave me the you could n't call it acting it was 
 i am probably one of the few viewers who would not recommend this film thought stunning like all of lee 's work each still frame seems worthy of a print i was really disappointed by the film 's pace it really was too story is set in civil war era missouri and is about a young man who joins the forces of the sort of who conduct type fighting with the their union counterparts he and his close friend jack 
 i really like the movie 's opening when col. ted masters on his fighter radar that four enemy aircraft were approaching from about N the good news is that the movie does not mention at the very beginning that the along with a fighter who was a was trying to do a freedom of navigation exercise along the eastern sea but went a little too past the restricted air space zone reserved for a middle eastern nation as they fly 
 you know the old saw about a train the one about how you ca n't look away this movie is n't that good the only reason you 're still there is because you brought your kids and you ca n't leave them alone in the theater you might catch a hill should never work in film again after delivering this awful piece of junk he manages to take a decent comic actor in lee and turn him into a actor 
 this one and the one prior 's and the next one seem to be completely different from the first two movies where the were not so nice it is basically choose your series the first two go together and the as while the next three are a series of them being the good guys this one plays out to much like some television series episode to be as good as part three was and i never really had the urge 
 john stars as in this silly little movie that has to be one of the best of the it or not moore is his co star if you love the grew up around that time or are an artist get ready to until you see the what a 
 it 's quite to see this today and appreciate how far we 've come along in what we expect from movies and at the same time appreciate how many were we have a talking film the audio and the are pushed to their period limits the is limited to about and up no face the are remarkable there 's an early cross cutting scene to the dialogue there 's a into a with some perspective a lies in the dust 
 this movie contains the worst acting performance of all time lacks energy to say the least energy is what moore gave us in i never felt once in this movie that was anxious for anything love justice not in this guy 's is also no chemistry between and if the plot did not force them to be friends you do n't get the impression they want to hang out with each other plus the has the more interesting dialogue is 
 let me start by saying that has gained a ton of respect from me after seeing his debut everything is anyone who has read the book knows how the story is with and by alex along with scenes and crazy took all of this and made it work the movie itself is great the the performances the it all works there is a lot of story missing about the town and its but there 's only so much you can 
 ok chuck has shown up in many an entertaining movie over the years this is not one of them i wo n't even bother trying to get into the plot about a shipment gone wrong the acting of the main characters is so wood like would have done a better job the based is even worse than the one in traditionally low budget movies are often trying to catch their audience by adding plenty of violence this one is trying 
 film about camera work shot on digital video and looks like early turn the other by looking past the and concentrate on the story for those with a sense of irony 
 to me is certainly one of the better movies i have seen i do n't think was primarily intended to be a movie but a movie questioning the ethics of science if you watch it with that in mind it turns into a really good film the only bit was the awful voice for the english version how can you expect any person to listen to these german for two hours let native english do the talking or use instead 
 steven 's movie career is a to horrible i have been with every one of them as soon as i realized that they were even more than jean 's has anyone else ever noticed that he never gets hit i mean give me something to root for a hard fought battle with a bad guy who 's scary years and he 's still the same fight scenes fight scenes can often you from the fact that your hero can not 
 this of 's ark has set 's and turner 's reputation back about N years however the production has it 's bright side a learning experience for movie entrepreneurs in how not to make a movie where in the of literature and common sense can one find these quotes and situations ok boys let 's up it 's too bad that god created the sun to only during the day when we really needed it at night we 're not 
 this movie was awful i had a very difficult time watching this all the way through i did n't get the point of the movie what was the point of this movie the was bad acting was bad and the story the two main characters in the movie were very boring and their was there was no chemistry among any of the cast members i do n't know this for a fact but i suspect that most of the actors 
 reading the various external reviews of roger and other well-known film critics makes me hesitate to admit how much i love this movie even though i only have a video version of many critics seem to take it as a minus that the story has been used before most in the very great it 's a wonderful life to me a great is a great no matter how many times it 's used and i 'd be happy to see 
 very very code and still very sassy i would highly recommend seeing this movie even if you are not a fan of she 's funny she 's she 's and love that she gets barbara is as a of a who rises up in the world perfectly portrayed by a bank building john wayne in a suit plays one of her first the last three minutes are a but the sets the lines the clothes all add to one of 
 this movie is a waste of time and money throughout the entire hour and a half i continued to wait for it to get better and it never did it was slow moving the plot jumped around it was n't scary or interesting and really never amounted to anything the credits during the introduction were long and drawn out which was basically like the rest of the movie long and drawn out numerous parts of the plot made no sense

 the author of the book by the same title should not have let her name be used for this movie if you have read the book this movie takes such a liberal interpretation of the actual events in the book and its spirit that the movie and book seem to have quite little in common except the title and some details the movie adds nothing in terms of artistic merit to the book 's own literary those who have not 
 this movie was incredible i would recommend it to anyone much better than what i had already anticipated it was definitely a spectacular movie it is an amazing story with amazing actors and definitely another great movie with washington should n't surprise anyone did a wonderful job as well 
 original beautiful movie the acting is great the en are paris at its but then the real paris not the famous and the music will do also a brilliant very detailed which i just very much best french movie i 've seen and french is very good 
 this movie had so much potential anyone who followed the story of jeffrey knows that there are so many details in this movie it 's ridiculous too much time and effort was spent in the movie on 's homosexual and his alcohol consumption where was the character development the of any are always interesting and was no exception where in the movie does it address his when he began killing and small animals instead we are giving a dizzying array 
 if the of this film had made any attempt at introducing reality to the plot it would have been just one more waste of time money and creative effort fortunately by throwing all of reality to the they have created a who could pass up a film in which an pilot spends the entire film acting like jack complete with the do not dismiss this film as trash 
 i watched of the for the first time when i was about N years old i am N now and have never forgotten the movie nor have i gotten over my with egypt i have searched the trying to buy the movie but have not been able to it it makes me wonder if this is one of the lost movies in hollywood i loved and jeffrey hunter together they have such together if you were to ask me anything 
 all the world 's a stage and its people actors in it or something like that who the hell said that theatre stopped at the pit or even at the theatre door why is not the audience participants in the theatrical experience including the story itself this film was a grand experiment that said the story is you and it needs more than your attention it needs your active participation sometimes we bring the story to you sometimes you have 
 yes this movie has kids going to space camp and it starts out enough as you have the kids meeting one another and learning the ropes then they introduce a robot that could not possibly exist in N as they do not have anything with that kind of intelligence now kid becomes buddy with robot and robot the kid 's by shooting him and a group of other kids in this camp into outer space with a very limited supply 
 one of disney 's best films that i can enjoy watching often you may easily guess the outcome but who its just plain fun escape for N hour minutes and after all was n't movies meant to get away from reality for just a short time anyway the cast with 
 robert downey jr. in a century and dress was enough to make me but i could n't believe a great actor like sam actually took a part in this movie the whole thing was i especially like 's cure for the they dance and everyone 's happy and they 're all better i guess i just did n't like the character too much therefore watching a whole movie about his supposed transition from a into a great physician was also 
 one of my favorite and one of john ford 's best in my opinion no major stars but ben johnson in most everything he appears and here he gets a rare lead as the title character matching him is ward bond as the leading his people west john ford 's stock of character actors including harry jr. russell simpson and provide ample support as does silent james a member of the that joins up with the train the trail into 
 for a this movie is actually better than a lot in the it is job goes on killing spree people die there are some good in this off i really liked the the job is definitely to say the least and possibly unique although i have n't watched every single film ever made also the of the bad due is something i have n't seen before and he way he finally meets his end is a novel concept as far 
 's and the horse 's mouth are the two most accurate films on what it is to be a real artist the key lines in 's are not as some other here have said an artist is never poor but two lines that come before and after it i was able to make them happy when i gave of my very best throughout the world sounds one long cry from the heart of the artist give me the chance to 
 in order to enjoy an portrait of ' stephen needs the to suspend all reality and prior knowledge of the american it 's the very use of ' name and knowledge to her life and work that sets this film up to fail on a grand becomes apparent quite early on with the casting of the beautiful and glamorous as the jewish is that did n't get or what her work was about and seems only attracted to on a 
 this is certainly the worst movie i ever saw the beginning is somewhat good but the end i still do n't even get it power N years later what the f is that about the acting is somewhat not so bad but some place i could do better for sure 
 surface was i do n't know how many i survived at school just by thinking about the new episode of surface i loved it sometimes i had to call home and tell my mom to tape it for me i was pretty upset when i heard it was i mean way to let us hang so they can have their new comedy you could n't pay me to watch that i think seeing the commercials made me i 'm miss 
 if there 's one thing that me most in seeing a bad film it 's seeing it done by experienced who ought to know better this of planet of the could have used some to say nothing of essential elements of character development the girl in the original planet of the was a better developed character than in this version for all that she does not say a single word one certainly expected a lot better from tim burton a 
 by the is an attack on the catholic church and its loss of values it is not a film and i think it would have played better on the stage takes us through this man the that lives like lived a true in poverty and without a care for property and what the next day some might call it a parallel to 's story but any and of the word life should be like in a way but in also 
 i saw this as a kid before it had been from the and even then it left a bad taste in my mouth there were some worked out but making out of american citizens who 'd been in camps strictly due to their race was himself might have wanted this one buried he was a liberal guy in his he told of visiting a town in the south where he saw a black man get off the sidewalk to avoid 
 i liked and as much as the next but this is too much the worst lead actress ever not even david hot is able to save this no wonder i never watch fox it we totally gave it a chance and it continued to we watched four or five painful episodes i want to kill the at the network so bad why is money being spent on this i do n't get it and i do n't support it and 
 sensitive film does lack and to some degree structure but is nevertheless shot and performed however the structure point is while it gives the impression of off loose ends in the final scenes and its thoughts with what might be described by the modern as a story i 'm as to whether this feel needs a structure that is and inevitably it will be compared with in that its central i 'm not sure that 's the correct word is 
 with this movie i was really hoping that the idea was to make up for the together of the first and yet to my is far worse than i could have hopes were up in the opening moments of the film inside the ship and i almost a sigh of relief when we finally saw the home world a digital painting but still nice to finally see it and then of course the humans if such poorly written characters can 
 the thing about this film is that only N people to leave a review of it and felt it leaving a comment on the message the same year as philadelphia the tom this is the film that people really should have seen and given to there is more life love and beauty in these two people than in just about any other film i have seen and it is all order for this to be printed i need to leave 
 this is about one of the worst movies i 'd ever seen it 's not the worst though the hands of fate holds that movie has a lot of problems to begin this whole movie is a cheap of the movies there 's the in a dress wearing a the quiet asian the bad guy the almost and so on there 's lots of errors in this film some of the errors i 've ever seen are in this when 
 this movie consists of such great especially with its outstanding that with the film tom cruise is one of my favorite actors because of his enthusiasm to make films and to this movie was not the best the first time i watched it but after about N more times i decided that this is one of the best films that i have ever seen it takes place in new york and on through his he a in his life with 
 this is a very rare film and probably the least known from temple as it is n't on any of her reason why is probably because it does n't have a happy ending unlike all her other also not a musical although she does belt out one song called ' the world owes me a film was made in N and originally in black and white the version i have is in and on i would say they have done 
 the wooden horse is a very movie about a very and successful escape plan worked out by british 's during world war ii it is acted with a sense of humor especially the lines expressed by the leo anthony and david later george banks in mary are as the two heroes the direction is and throughout highly recommended 
 running out of time somewhere in the middle of to 's in the solid good category as a crime it 's not original or overwhelming and the action scenes will not blow you away but it has something else going for it it 's a to film after all it has has N hours to live he decides to play a strange game with a negotiator of the police played by that 's the plot in a on top of 
 i have grown up pouring over the stories of the in time my dream was that one day a would come across their child sitting in a large reading a in time and would think what an amazing movie this would make enough that failed changing characters throwing in humor and all out destroying the plot i know that it is a hard task to change a well loved novel into a movie but why ca n't you stay true

 this was a waste of N minutes of my life the acting was and the plot was ridiculous it around an evil who gets rich married men to have sex with her and then them for money one of the victims is a candidate for which is causing problems in his relationship with his wife another is a plastic surgeon also married and the evil happens to this guys wife too meanwhile the evil 's girlfriend does n't really like 
 i still have late night cheap of this show from back when and all when i would stay up to whatever weird hour they would this show on just so i could tape series was n't really about only the first couple of episodes actually involved him as anything but a rod announcer instead each episode was a distinct nightmare using the traditional themes of dating dating money death dating and the episode where a boy says i will love 
 i saw this film earlier today and i was at how accurate the is for the main characters it did n't feel like a film it felt more like a the part i liked best the leading in this film seemed as real to me as any i in all a very film for those who enjoy independent films 
 there is only one reason to watch this movie if you are not related to one of the stars or a producer actress she is the show in this slow moving and wildly unlikely story of directed by simon the film stars as a wife who decides to seek on her ' spouse oh but not by conventional means she plans a total guerrilla war and bad girl as her weapon of choice she wants as tuesday to get close 
 just what we need another of vintage hollywood with eddie murphy again in his second time around after the professor N this shows why we 're running out of special ideas in making a quality movie and it has some signs of hope for its and of animals who can act and speak with humans things can only get more worse unfortunately jokes and sexual kill this piece of family instantly even parents and children saw the ad on the 
 as far as fake go anyone this one is up there with the best it looks very real and that is what it aims for in recent light of events this movie is even so you could say it was ahead of it 's time when it was released in the one can only hope that a government like that does n't exist looking for and people just like that of course the people interviewed all seemed to have the 
 i loved all dogs go to so much that i went to see the in the theater and i ca n't remember being more disappointed by a movie the story worse than an of i mean come on how could possibly imagine being able to get on an animal so much bigger than him no matter how angry he was plus as a cat how can you get so much for the story is it any wonder that don burt 
 this show has come so far at first everyone in the cast from eric to they were all new actors and fresh faces and just look what they accomplished they stuck with the show and it was a success its one of the best shows ever made and its probably the i 've ever seen in my life it will be sad to see it end but if they end this show i hope to god that the series goes 
 based on the comments made so far everyone seems to either hate this movie or love it i think it would be fair to point out that although this is not a great movie it has its interesting moments for one thing it was on location in colorado was it or i ca n't remember but it is in the credits the location is absolutely stunning and spectacular it 's beautiful even to me who lived in colorado for several 
 i had the experience of upon a for this movie and thought it might be interesting i am a fan of the two main actors and i even find to be oddly appealing but that could n't compensate for the plot of this movie this movie attempts to make social comments and be i am sure the audience gets the message clearly but has to suffer in the process personally no matter how bad the movie is i ca n't 
 chris 's like about and identity is amazing from start to finish a first film is as complex as or the prestige though maybe a little harder to get a handle on still it of and creative drive and has a twist as challenging as it is realistic pulp few film makers have made as good of use of their editors and attention to that has the story is about a writer who likes to follow random down the street 
 i found the characters and the story i never had to read this book or it would have been a painful experience i got the tickets to the for free but it still was n't worth my time or my friend 's i think this story is not worth telling it 's like saying that old people have a past before they got old no the lives of the main characters were painful to watch one generation no better than 
 when this movie first came out back in N prince was one of the hottest acts around everyone wanted to see this movie which was not much more than a extended music video the acting was pretty bad but what can you expect from musicians acting on the big screen for the first time despite that it was still a very entertaining film morris day and jerome benton provide some all time classic comedy especially their of the which will 
 first of all i was n't sure who this film was aimed at it seemed like a story for kids but had stuff in it kids would n't understand and find boring there was n't really much to it bruce was n't stretched as an actor at all he did a lot of to the side with that half of his unless you are a big fan of his i would n't bother and if it 's the story you 
 i ca n't tell you all how much i love this movie i have read reviews that say that this move is too confusing or like in concrete i say that these have no for anyone who fantasy this movie is for you if you ever loved playing & this movie is for you especially if you got into the i 'm just sorry that i did not get to see this movie on the big screen just more incentive 
 the buddy story shows the famous singer 's in the texas to his rise to to his death in a plane crash strengthened by the fact that gary as plays his own instruments this movie is the in its form there are some things that seem a little namely the people of considering rock ' roll to be the 's music but the performances outweigh any weaknesses if there 's only one thing that 's for certain in this great 
 i took my daughter to see nancy drew over the weekend and found myself first off it was clean and i mean by my standards the majority of kids ' movies today are full of crude toilet humor and jokes to cheap from the crowd nancy drew is than that however and the humor is and title role is played with a by roberts who is and without ever becoming unlike the brady bunch movie where the characters are and 
 another in the they do n't make like that category this story of a family with some real in its still as good clean sometimes fun robert and are at their peak as the troubled and they really took the roles and ran with them won an and was in the supporting categories both being they the somewhat leads neither nor hudson could ever be called bad actors but they 've both had better parts and played them far more 
 so this is the movie that the next action stars were getting into well i 'm glad that i did n't participate and did n't win is n't it funny how one can just look at the first N seconds and make up ones mind about a movie i mean come on just look at those titles i watched this movie or part of this since it was produced for tv and we could n't bear to watch the whole 
 this was a surprisingly very good movie and an interesting idea however it was just a little bit disappointing in that the ' was a little too predictable and just a bit too early on in the movie watching it started to get a little bizarre and confusing to the point that the only reasonable outcome possible was the inevitable plot twist but it certainly did not this movies flow there were performances there was never a boring moment so 
 ' is probably the word i 'd use to try and start describing this film i only watched it because it had a good rating on here and i was so let the film is about in a post america and the director went at it with a there was no in the film at all and it felt as though they were trying to achieve a kind of feel to the film which is never a good idea as 
 the biggest and most things of the movie was ending for the is identical to except kid in the was a bit better acted and action then the adult the to the movies was rather poor choice in plot line the only thing that approached good was the beginning with the kids in the jeep then the plot went down hill from there would have been nice if a different plot had been devised rather then the earlier movies the 
 an short group of little are given a lesson in by frank who compares america to the house i live little film a message about the of & bias is an natural in front of the camera intense & he is the perfect for the values house i live in ' by lewis & robinson this fine tune with a solid message is being given something of a comeback since the events of september N harbor hollywood went to war 
 what a great word is is n't that what they call of the dead N a word indeed it the term that everyone has grown to hate that is and makes it almost sound as if the process of making one was creative and involved the well damn was i at least i was more by the thought of and violence than by the idea of though it played a why make a directors do it for only a few 
 for me the and its characters by which i mean the ones are like old friends ever since i first began to experience the play through acting classes i played ferdinand i found myself immediately caught up in the world that shakespeare created i can remember one student deciding not to play ferdinand after all and so i took the stage and had the honor of playing opposite an excellent of the that a great friend has is that you 
 a recent of that 's entertainment has given me the urge to watch many of the classic mgm from the and is certainly a lesser film than on the town the are n't as good nor is the chemistry between the characters but the film classical such as and the scene at the hollywood bowl with and kelly emerging from the woods above it at the top and then running down the steps while dozens of play on the piano 
 i think the film is educational however it fails to treat the issue which sparked so much controversy marriage also the film fails to reveal what the church big opportunity was missed to tell the world what they actually believe i could not get a clear idea of what it is views are on central topics of have many friends and they are nice people would have been nice to get a picture of how they view their 's more 
 this movie was recommended to me so we went to see it together i would n't call it a movie it 's more like a combination of N different stories which are not all that funny there 're several characters in the movie who looked important in the beginning and they just disappeared from the story he 's just trying too hard to fit everything in N hours i left the show without wondering what happened to this and that 
 that show is the best tv show ever period it 's up there with the andy show saturday night live and the in my book that show continued on for N seasons all of which focus around a group of adults dealing with relationships from their parents and their overall two main characters eric and are two living next door to each other they have been living next door to each other for most of their lives and just begin 
 for us an and movie is something you have to be in the mood for i 'm very happy i recorded this my wife remembered it from when she was young but i had never seen it the family wanted to watch something not too serious before bed and this was daughter has watched many of the old movies with us always complaining in the beginning but most often coming around she mostly ignored this in the beginning to check 
 this was without a doubt the worst movie i have ever sat through and that 's saying because i 've seen my share of horrible i have never seen a movie in which every single character portrayed was an loser seriously there was not one respectable character in the entire script how that the plot was equally lacking any intelligence ca n't believe that and would even consent to participating in such and while i have n't seen all of 
 a overall for a story action is respectable the children are and their is unclear the leading was a nice change but could have been better i love you was more than you complete me but at least van got a chance to show a little one of van 's better movies 
 a tour ok the kid that plays oliver is a bit sweet starting with the great color and most impressive performances this is a must see movie i have seen several of this great novel but this one stands above them all and its a musical to it is a never leaving his character to do a song you never really know if you like him or not the same feeling i got in the book in other versions you 
 for all of the about this film i kept an open mind as to what i would ultimately think and although a bit slow at times the first N of the movie is quite good with more than a few old time that make one and unsettled i actually thought the was excellent regarding many of these scenes where dark remains fails however is in its the ending of the film and the are what seems to be miles apart 
 i wanted to see ever since i saw that and were in it because they had played in some of my favorite movies ever when i watched i was at how great the story line actually was it me to see that it has a low rating because it was not horrible at all the actors and played the parts and the way it ended was so brilliant and some scenes were a little and or poor and i admit 
 the part i was a stunning look inside the family and how an innocent young man was all but forced into circumstances he never wanted to have a part of the part ii shows that young man 's acceptance of his new role his of character as well as his complete loss of all as he deeper and deeper into a life of crime the first two parts of this of this of michael make for one of the greatest 
 high the tale of by a guy who fell victim to one of the and jokes in history unfortunately after the promising opening the went straight to hell a very and mess with and a final half hour that on a whole new level of the guy who played the actually killed himself shortly after the was released if you rent the stop it after the and remember choose life 
 jack N is out of the question i 'm actually surprised people are allowed to make these sort of sam and his wife take to the for a christmas jack returns to kill off the fun and take on a with do n't take a at this film at all most people say its a with your but its a waste of time if the people who made this film can get a job by doing what they do they 
 chan is in new york and he gets involved with an attempt to sabotage a new aircraft war was over a year away from reaching america but the second world war was already everywhere else in the world and so it everything since most people probably realized that war was coming here the war is n't mentioned but the fact that the film deals with the production of planes at the very least to it the mystery itself is pretty 
 i recently saw this at the N palm springs international film festival the film 's title and in fact much of the of the film is from the robert beauty in trouble jan directs a by from a story by and the story begins in N when is hit by one of those devastating N year that the household of ana and roman and their two children and because of the conditions where they now live 's is life threatening 
 i saw this film when it first came out and did n't know what to expect exactly what followed the was one of the most i have ever had a score of and music by leslie of doctor & and the factory fame as well as making his mark on the broadway musical scene and scored by the john williams there 's not a bad song in the entire film plus some of the most design and locations i have 
 is excellent is this film he makes a woman 
 this film had it been done properly has so much potential films are always funny and people tend to like them because they 're light stupid and silly but fun this film was funny in some parts but it could have been a lot the acting itself was ok from all the actors but i was n't satisfied it seemed a empty and my summary title says it all about the effects proper green screens were n't used for this 
 how many more of those fake of life movies need to be made hopefully not too victor is a very attempt by the director peter at the attention of hollywood nothing wrong with that in general what is wrong with this film in particular is that it the audience and on every in the book of supposedly hollywood independent 's supposed to be real so left shake the camera style except no would shake the camera on purpose it 's 
 as i am always looking for something new and unique i watched this film i thought that it would be just another b rate movie but i was at the acting by the two main characters all of the actors in this film were very capable and well directed the plot was wonderful and unique as well with an excellent moral to the movie is definitely not for someone looking for a sex and or blood and this is a 
 the choice to make this into a movie was far better thought out than other recent ones the humor involved in the character is not humor and is also character driven enough to be stretched out for an hour or enough the sexual content seemed like it could be avoided but that may have been because the constraints of live television me to not expect it i i was thinking more leisure suit larry than the producers were definitely not 
 in N was still a and probably raised more than a few industry when cbs signed her to $ N million television deal nothing these days but more important than that and her manager insisted on creative control and got it she had this special her way and for the most part her vision was by turns and incredible opening act i with the title song not written specifically for her races through a cast of linked with i 'm 
 this film gets off to a bad start an is followed immediately by a truly amazing crash then things go again as you realize that the are all a bad actors apart from the pilot and the and b almost all of them fit too into the role of hell half of them do n't even speak english preventing the audience from getting to know the characters at all you feel as if you were watching deep blue sea meets 
 this movie was really bad i mean really really bad the scenes were like from a and special effect a lot and it was in N i think this was a great waste of time and money and michael with his from ' image just made me never waste your time with this picture i really do n't know what the director was thinking after seeing the final cut of this movie but the fights were so that it hurt 
 pulled off a real beauty of a that appears except for the now just how did the studio known for chuck movies ever come up with a complete lack of knowledge in the first place case in point the acting and horrible plot is a sign that the is no cure for some execution they actually went on and made another cheap featuring hundreds of just to make this look even better for the two brothers they sure know how

 N days no script that 's what the tells you is how the movie was made it 's shot in video that 's occasionally used to good effect but it 's really partially naked women sitting around in a room for most of the running time it is very well acted and this helps a lot but the killer only shows up once in a long time and the sit and they do n't try to escape or do anything 
 blind date columbia pictures N was a decent film but i have a few issues with this film first of all i do n't fault the actors in this film at all but more or less i have a problem with the script also i understand that this film was made in the N 's and people were looking to escape reality but the script made ann 's character look weak she kept going back and forth between suitors and

 a little bit ' could be a children 's film it 's a very concept upon some interesting themes and goes against pretty much every hollywood convention you can think of what goes against everything more than literally nothing nothing is the story of two friends who wish the world away when everything goes wrong with their lives all that 's left is what they do n't hate and a big empty white space it 's hard to focus a

 the of has to be one of the for a movie i 've yet run across you would have to look far and wide to find anything that approaches the level of on display in this movie acting bad bad direction bad special effects bad and plot bad lighting bad bad design bad and silly everything else bad watching the of is about as as a root even for a fan of bad movies it 's a real test this

 guy gives the a lot of like most candidates he knows almost nothing warren william a very under rated actor is in giving instructions to that is he teaches him to say something which means nothing to the voting public a campaign based on no comment i 'll take it under and maybe yes but then again maybe no is the nearly perfect way to win an election the the candidate the greater the chance he or she will win 
 one of those movies where you take bets on who will die first and who will survive at the end there was just something about the movie that made me zone out i think because i keep looking back and thinking still in that tree still looking at the water poor character development i felt nothing when they were in danger i was voting for the i found it hard to believe a would try to tip a boat in

 i saw this movie way back at the first theatrical release in a empty theater believe it or not after decades of watching movies this one still clearly in my mind as the worst movie of all time or at least the worst that i would allow myself to acting is far beneath the standard set by any random group of high-school students off the street and forced to learn their lines in N minutes or the first shock of

 no real plot to this one just a series of short acting out some very old jokes i once or twice in the beginning much to my but even at only N minutes this film wears out it 's welcome before too long and becomes and with some in here and there to keep you still as bad as this movie is and that 's pretty it 's a compared to pretty much anything by & date movie movie meet

 i do n't know why but i thought i 've seen this movie before maybe it was the name maybe it was the way looked i do n't know anyway it was quite promising in the beginning and even throughout the whole feature there were some bright moments maybe its because i 'm not a huge fan of the and i do n't watch them a lot but this one actually looked fresh sometimes but the rest of it is

 i was so by this film i felt obligated to warn off others this film has no story plot or hint of purpose the film starts after the standard lets be scary movie which by now every film has become accustomed so we can ignore the beginning completely we are soon introduced to the main actress and from this point it becomes clear to all that you have just wasted your hard earned and would be better off watching unless

 saw this at the hong kong international film festival over three years ago i went in with no expectations since christopher was a at the time but it sounded interesting and turned out to be one of the best things i saw at that festival it worked well on the big screen with the technique of cutting the scenes out of adding to the mood gave a good account of its making at the end enough to put anybody off 
 absolutely film and it is n't funny at all lead character played by is very by and star wars is just plain is the only good think about this movie he should master his english and move to hollywood hollywood can not find an actor with his other than this movie is a is a comic writer and this movie is his worst written work to this of is another plus of this waste of money actor also have some 
 this movie is about development people growing and people people surprising and people disappointing it has it all and more there is hope frustration justice love and hate it is truly a classic drama that has performances from the whole cast but especially goldberg in her debut movie made me feel very human and proud of it and i suggest that this movie should be mandatory each saturday in all prisons in the world it your rating N of i 
 this movie had all the elements to be a smart comedy but for some reason it took the route perhaps it did n't really know who its audience was but it 's hardly a man 's movie given the cast and plot yet is too and to appeal fully to you have seen legally and its then this is like the awful great actors such as wilson should expect better material simpson could also have managed so much more cook

 i am a huge fan of big loud completely stupid action movies such as the rock con air etc all of these are great fun to watch but when you think about it extremely silly in the line of fire tells a story and it tells it well with as well as excitement and it also addressed several important moral questions that really make you think the last shot of the movie is and sitting together on the steps of

 let me just start out by saying that tourist trap is a better movie then of the films that have come out of hollywood lately if you do n't believe me see falls or they and it is certainly better than any of those direct to video releases like the pool and so on one of the big problems with the film tourist trap is that is never really found an audience when the film opened in N it was

 i gather at least a few people watched it on on if you did you know that had to change her name to avoid being associated with this movie when she came the u.s. it was a huge scandal and i gather that the original release in the u.s. was so up by that it was practically i watched because i had just seen a on bad women in the u.s. movie censorship board set up in the early it 
 i have to admit that for the first half hour or so of this movie i was basically lost there had been some mildly amusing but at best a plot and a general sense of that was on the verge of making me think that i was my time then for no apparent reason i suddenly realized that i was enjoying this there was no moment of and no suddenly dramatic scene that grabbed me in fact nothing very exciting 
 the of hearing jay words is the only aspect of this in course the teams up with the late pat to track down a stolen prototype think car played a hand in the plot the two leads try hard they really do but is no actor and 's routine gets old in a hurry the film carries a bit of appeal but its worthy moments become increasingly scarce as it out its running time fans of 's considerable will feel 
 being the prototype of the classical movie and having a good story as well as two more brilliant in what an beauty and anthony i can only recommend this movie to all those having even the for and at its best 
 yes is the word for this actress i know many have mentioned her beauty but this found her empty headed and boring to watch with her hair and not so perfect body watch her walk away in those jeans showing a rather large her spreads beyond her what does that tell you as for the leading man played by mark he was perfectly cast a however he and lancaster just did n't match she was out of place opposite this

 the recent release of good humor man labels the film as comedy it 's hardly a comedy rather a film about a group of losers supposedly set in the there is attention paid to period details with overly color correction taking its place the only serves to the of the film perhaps that is the point but it does not add to the of the experience the of losers only like to hang out at one location the it seems

 first of all i 'd just like to say this movie more than any of the recent that hollywood has up out of its is a true action film with more violence than most viewers can handle it has all of the classic elements of a late N 's action film the random acts of violence when and crew go in to the drug dealers to get money they just show up and kill them rather than letting them live

 what a bad movie is perhaps the very worst movie i 've seen all year and i 've run across some there is nothing about this trash from the to the direction to the plot even the usually brilliant could n't save this movie none of the characters are in the least bit sympathetic with the possible exception of portrayed by the only bright spot in this dismal failure possible the main problem with is that it on without saying

 what a waste of precious time my daughter brought this home from my mother 's house and we watched it as a family none of us liked it this little film with christian themes and horrible film quality is not worth watching even on a it felt a bit like a bad high-school drama class attempt at film making how sad to see actors chris gary and company their way through this and the only good thing i can say 
 this film if not creates a whole new with perfect truth fun talent and that make for magic from creative musical numbers to off the comedy that actors at their very best if i had n't have known better i would have thought there was an elaborate script you get a mighty wind meets conversations with god meets something so fresh and new and that it becomes it 's own and fell both give performances and you in immediately the

 this is the first film i 've watched from the italian ed wood miles the above title was added later on since there exists another similarly titled N movie richard which was films ' michael ' one and only at the western the genuine italian title was originally translated as his name was sam but they called him although it was actually in the italian which of course implies a of sorts to hollywood actor eli while certainly not bad 
 i am a christian and thought this movie was pretty good while the acting was n't academy award i thought it was good considering the cast has had limited acting experience at the time this movie was message and the power of was explained the message that the director was trying to get across which is the important thing not how the characters dressed definitely got through the theme of having the main characters involved in illegal drag racing was

 the film starts to slowly when we got to the we thought it looked quite good but after about N we were all out of our minds and wondering what kind of film we had come to see i do n't like this film and would n't recommend it to anyone the best part of the night was when the alarm and lights came back on because the project broke down because we thought we could all go home this 
 i 'm at this very moment whether i should even finish watching this of a movie they had a pretty interesting idea with the buried movie set and that was it so far this mess has no real story there is the buried set some wolf headed monster running an and a bunch of bad actors attacked by the wolf whatever it is what i would have missed had i had the good sense to this nonsense is a chase 
 seriously i do n't understand how justin long is becoming increasingly popular he either has the best agent in hollywood or recently sold his soul to he is almost to watch on screen he has little to no and terrible timing the only film that he has attempted to that i 've enjoyed was waiting and that is almost solely because i 've worked in a restaurant but i aside from it 's terrible lead this film has of other 
 i 'd really really wanted to see this movie and waited for months to get it through our blockbuster total access account when it showed up in our i threw it straight into the was very disappointed which in turn made me mad i 'll give any movie a chance even if i want to walk out of the ' i watched it all the way through but did n't get anything from it but acting was very very good 
 if you like you might like this film i recommend this film to fans of dutch like or even american stuff like the bold & the beautiful if you do n't like that stuff stay away from this movie it has the same kind of style the same quality of acting direction and film was a big hit at home territory but was n't sold anywhere else outside and belgium pretty strange for a commercial film like it says something 
 i think that if i went to a first school somewhere deep in the and asked the bottom set of english to come up with a script it would make more sense than this i could then go to the first year drama group and they would act it out better than the in this film this sounds really mean but i 'm certain that they made this as a joke and are entirely aware that they see what i 
 i i am from my video store because of all the controversy that surrounded it when it was first released in i also heard that at first it was seized by u.s. customs if it ever tried to enter this country therefore being a fan of films considered controversial i really had to see this for plot is centered around a young swedish drama student named who wants to learn everything she can about life in particular she wants to 
 i figured the did n't even show the time or how long it was i thought wild was the worst movie i 'd ever seen this one is much worse makes no sense thrown together plot all so we can see on a figure that does n't support them it had to of been a student film that gotten a c entertainment until i found out it was n't going to end the ending made no 
 as a former N time world champion i like movies about sacrifice for sport but this movie is about so much more this movie is so good and so deep i have recently been plagued by very serious injury and pretty much a lack of passion almost lights out for me and this silly little movie touched me so deep that like out of a it reminded me about what life is supposed to be about this is a movie 
 this movie was so horrible i 'm so glad i did n't have to pay money to see this horrible movie it was like a history went on a coke binge the of it made it look decent but it was really bad i will say the idea sounded decent but come on it was really really bad if u sat down and thought about it you would also realize it was come on back in the day u think 
 this is just about the worst piece of garbage i 've ever had the of sitting through the story was the graphics were horrible and the acting i 've never seen worse acting in my entire life a class could come up with a better written and more entertaining concept than this i anyone who their time on this film as well as the actors who agreed to doing the job it was obvious that they were not given appropriate 
 i am sure there is some sort of that likes movies that made fun of after seeing both this and and reading dozens of comments about how they are i became convinced that there is some going on here of people are saying that people who hate it are only scared by do n't know good or stuff like that well i do n't really care for but i do want something to happen in a movie most of it 
 here 's yet another movie with lead characters who are totally and yet we 're supposed to root for them not me no character in this film was worth a williams plays car salesman o'brien the man has no class a loser in every moral sense and a guy who thinks he can talk his way out of anything knowing williams ' ability to talk he was good for this role the women in his life are driving him too

 blind spot 's images are great the action draws you in completely even though the movie is a bit long by the end credits all that you can think about are the film 's positive the lead actors have the most incredible screen presence the story is the film score is completely moving in its own powerful way not your standard moments add to the and hope you get a chance to see this film it into some dark territory 
 rarely does a film capture such intense drama and what makes this film so is that the drama feels so real it 's almost hard to remember that it 's only a movie this is by far and alan 's performance of their careers the film almost feels like a theatrical production the way it is staged and the only bad thing about this movie is that it 's very difficult to get a copy of it i have yet

 should be to be involved with this awful film the acting and script are all with the entire film playing out like an excuse for larry to get laid the only reason it was made at all is most likely due to his association with the plot of the film is pretty and basically tries to survive on to older and some from guys like david dennis and jones each one is in their performance particularly who is in mode 
 i found it hard to like anyone in this film the central characters and michael whose daughter disappears during a night out in the australian are not bad people but then surely not all or even most of the scores of people we see throughout this movie would be bad if we knew them better but though we are as sure as the film wants us to be of the or of the from the start of their life 's

 maybe it was the fact that i saw the day before i saw wild but i do not think that there can be any excuse for this movie being as bad as it was the cast was there to do it but it seemed as if once they found them with a decent cast they had to try and make them fit into the movie the only problem was that they did not fit i did not like any of 
 quote anyone with an over N would have seen this film what it is an well acted to a modern day classic yes it does n't have a blockbuster cast or a huge budget but it is still very well done and had me for the full over N you say that most mean you have an lower than N its name is way rise to power meaning it should have something the first one to do all and all

 the following are some of the most problems with this movie N seriously awful are the around in time which would be fine if done well but it 's characters that do n't develop so much as either remain utterly or drastically change for no good big one horrible acting over the top from nearly every following are some of the best points from the movie N the lead is damn good i see it there are only two kinds

 not even original in the plot there were a couple of that could have been quite interesting but the film follows the path of N of hollywood movies i do n't really get samuel jackson 's acting most of the time in his other films but he was rather good in this film he rarely and went much further in his character rather than to an in your face anger i liked as usual and even though she is great

 says andy nobody gets hurt everybody wins before he says it we know the opposite is true everybody gets hurt nobody wins this is a new in american movies or perhaps an old brought back at long last think eastern promises there will be blood no country for old men these movies are dark serious extremely well made and do n't care about happy i love them before the knows you 're dead fits the general but creates an atmosphere 
 about N minutes into this excuse for a movie i realized it reminded me of one of those people at work who 're always telling really jokes or doing extremely things because they think it 's funny and are trying to everyone this film is billed as she 's not that bad of an actress but her lines are n't funny and she 's not the acting is some of the most i 've ever seen except for the girl

 this film would usually as the worst movie production ever ever but in my opinion it is possibly the the direction and makes this film i bought the movie through the bargain 's at my local pound shop me and some friends then watched it rather drunk it soon occurred that this was n't any normal film instead a of what will probably be james 's last film at first we were confused and were for the player to be

 this is an line but it really sums up this movie if this is the current state of then we 're in real trouble i saw this film at because of the high rating and if there was ever a case of vote on then this is it just watch the number fall over the release weeks of the plot boy finds out his high school is getting married to a female friend of theirs so he goes back to 
 if there 's one that helped to put on the more than any other it 's gerald this tale of a little boy who only speaks in sound effects has kept its for the last N years besides the effects loved the music the and backgrounds the by marvin miller pretty much everything and it won the for best short of glad to have seen it on after reading about this dr. story for so many years and rocky and

 what a cast and what a waste of it seriously when a movie has jamie stuart and in it you would expect some quality the movie is however one big mess with a unlikely story that ca n't seem to stop putting twist and turns in it i think that they thought they were really being with all of story is not only and unlikely it also is n't exactly original it uses elements from earlier and much better game

 this was a real let down for me the original with white hair is a great fantasy film but this one was pretty weak i did n't care at all for the new characters who unfortunately dominated the screen time and the story was n't well developed while the first film was and involving this one was as i merely counted the time to the end when the would actually meet the action was poor in this one as well

 i am probably one of the few who actually read stephen king 's book the one this movie was based on after reading this excellent work i could not wait to see the movie version of it after the movie i was totally disappointed the only thing that this movie has in common with the book is the title and the names of the characters in the book 's character is put on a game show the main object is

 this movie although well shot and acted was awful i felt as if i was watching a car accident sure i kept watching but i really wanted to turn my head the plot leaves little to be was extremely and the ending was although it did fit the tone of the movie i was hoping for something to improve this movie i still do n't understand what the to and the child get bit by the fox at the beginning 
 this was the worst movie i have ever seen i have to admit i did n't watch it from beginning to end as cleaning the toilet was more ' was the most character i 've ever seen neither funny nor attractive in fact and are far too is painful to watch there is no acting especially not from the star who as a up take off on one of those loud black horrible as it is to watch one of 
 usually when a movie receives a vote of one it is because someone simply it and is it does n't have a lower rating and so decides to drag it down as much as they can instead of just giving it a low rating this is not the case is a perfect example of a film it does nothing right and it does n't have the chance to because it does n't really attempt to do anything there are of

 just watched this on three times once the ' way once with the scenes in consecutive order in this of a film the beginning middle and end of the story and once with the director 's commentary running quite amazing a tale told with more energy and substance than most features being released today i think this is an even more accomplished film than the subsequent which turned me on to in the first place ca n't wait to see 
 there is an endless supply of movies it seems that people never get tired of trying to scare and very seldom these attempts succeed this unfortunate movie has almost no value the story is highly predictable most of the actors very or just special effects of very low quality it took a lot of effort not to switch off the and go to bed with such a limited number of foreign movies issued in the usa why in the world

 about the only thing i liked about this film is that there was just enough in it to keep me in my seat to the end i kept thinking that maybe in the next scene things would those who like van 's films especially his later ones will probably like this personally i find van 's films to be and well he was an executive producer for this film so it is no surprise that the film could almost have 
 garden state is another of these pictures that supposedly on production values for the of giving the audience some real human drama oddly enough the production is very good so are the performances by some fairly actors as well where the picture is lacking is in 's script which seems mostly from situations taken from other you 're as young as is you have n't really lived enough to use the experience as film 's experience looks to be from

 i caught lost at the new york film and video festival and i guess i had some high hopes for this film this is just another calling card the story is pretty the bad lighting and camera work along with the less than great and music all make the film seem low it really too much to ask that have better stories and have the rest of the technical production be on par with the you ca n't just get 
 here is a movie that was so for N of it that it had no right to become so challenging and frustrating at the end did the director decide to become suddenly N through the making of this movie alert thing start out typically enough for N 's there are good bad gangs the old manager and the town things follow the expected path until about N minutes before the end when the only character is killed off and the 
 i also viewed this film at the santa barbara film festival it was an excellent film about adult family relationships paul wrote the film and included some to his family it was funny warm and moving as well as entertaining a film like this would do very well with the word of mouth reviews i would definitely tell my friends and family to see this film let 's only hope they 'll have the chance i would rate this film

 for those with this is a very good introduction while deals with the reality behind the of many things including medicine this work is surprisingly of the way medicine is going today two decades after the movie was made and over a decade after his death beyond that some into 's view of life in general are into ' the movie as well the century may well turn out to be the first and last century of the united states 
 well this is a typical straight to the toilet story short a bunch of adults becoming in the middle of woods and get down by naked movie has all the for this women or young adults being in death scenes last being a well built young woman who will always show off her but never less crazy man who knows about the evil scene being a killer then for a film it was really terrible the atmosphere is totally dead 
 a very credible and movie portraying the effects of war on the general public shame gives us a understanding oh 's the absence of color and sound as in a helps to give the film a more realistic feeling there is no soft or hard lighting or a variety of camera to give the story a or dramatic effect everything is very simply portrayed as it would be in reality at times the was confusing but perhaps in order to

 frankly after cotton club and it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and in this film because it is bad the acting was bad the were extremely and it was well shot but then again it is a big budget movie it was too predictable even for a i even knew from the beginning that he was going to die in the end the only thing i did n't know was how too politically correct very disappointing the only 
 this is one of those movies you think that the makers would refuse to release it because it is so terrible obviously they were thinking that children are stupid and are excellent for endless ads and would think they are entertainment because it is funny what is it with the talking car with that say wendy 's & 's and there was no talking car in the dr. is supposed to be evil not and why is rupert ' anyway 
 as a of sorts to the 's top N films the british film institute worked out a with martin i am a huge film fan and pride myself on having seen many many films but i am in with my in this though long walks the through several stages of the american history on film this is divided in to several sections including the western the film and the full of enthusiasm martin is a great tour guide as well 
 i enjoyed 's du pont and was therefore expecting this film to be of a similar standard well the first N minutes were ok but then it into a rather of a young man looking for the of life a sad disappointment 
 i thought it was weird and just not scary i have seen a couple of the japanese films and and loved them but this movie was a disappointment it never even explained anything about the i just did n't see any it was n't scary to me at all the whole time i was watching i was waiting for to discover the secret of the and why it was happening now if this was some ancient why did n't it 
 i saw this movie about a year ago and found it to be completely funny a real winner in my mind it had the of a stupid comedy but indeed had an actual plot as well much like the hit comedy in fact it had a few serious moments between when shot black 's horse an ordinarily moment you found yourself laughing at his you can actually find common ground there as i 'm sure many people have done something 
 henry fool is a better film but this is the perfect way to a film like fool ' to take henry very seriously his ' and his even the opening shot of fool ' when simon puts his to the ground as henry comes walking over the hill is more fully through grim ' the jokes that are more or less about the writing of the film and the jokes themselves are good but the opening of the film is 
 hollywood does it again lots of money no creativity i 'm sure the writers were on something other than when they wrote this one based on the i thought that this would be a funny movie but if you are not up on the latest stupid pop culture then you 'll miss most of the silly humor in this movie why waste your time you can sit on a doing nothing and have more fun than this movie will provide 
 i should have trusted my better no expectations no disappointments instead however i expected to experience a similar like N and was disappointed is in my opinion nothing but a cheap attempt to cash in on the success of its predecessor and it fails it appears some producer gathered up material from threw it together placed everything in slow motion and got some pop under the of philip glass to throw together some background music which is repeated where the 
 this film looked promising but it was actually pretty bad the was but the plot itself was terrible the actors tried their best with limited material but they could not rise above the mean of this college film was once again even more so than in the rest of the cast were quite scenes that should have been fun turned out to be & tries to be a road pie but fails on all levels a total waste of everyone 
 not a terrible film my N year old boy loved it and he would be the target so i guess they hit the spot pretty for an adult to to characters even high-tech thought the choice of the three great of the world was a bit odd unity duty and am i the only one who thinks those sound just a bit especially what about freedom justice etc oh well it will sell kind of for a movie but not 
 not a bad way to start it i thought this was original but then i discovered it was a of the N of king kong i never saw king kong until i was i saw this film when i was the film 's music will get stuck in your head not to mention the film 's theme song by the this is the worst effects i 've ever seen at the same time this film remains a of quotes take 
 this is definitely a lesser known comedy short from the the only reason i saw it was because it was on a by films featuring and featuring they are interesting and historically important but also generally average to below average for the style film compared to by and lloyd they are definitely a step below them in quality and humor also the accompanying music was pretty poor by the standards of other silent i ended up turning off the sound 
 the two things are are good about this film are it 's two unknown in her first appearance in a film young and with looks that still her body today the very beginning which is all she is in and that is that she is obviously just starting out because her acting improved with her next the score by then known christopher chris young is what keeps this from getting a one star i know one star more is not

 this film is so that you may actually at it but no even this is too much for this lost of i found it as an offer in a magazine and that 's why i 've seen it i regret the time i lost to see this N out of N because they do n't have a lower grade 
 given the title this first to N obviously reduces the number of w. stories which the film the author still turns up to introduce the episodes but there s no this time around by the way while the script of the original gave sole credit to here himself also lent a hand in the as well as though it s unclear whether they contributed one segment each or else worked in as can be expected much of the crew of 
 what can you say about this movie it was not terrible but it was not good two days earlier i had watched and that was one of the best films i have ever seen so this was not the best time to watch a story was silly and the acting was it was not bad enough to turn off but it had some bad moments and some terrible it was not very well cast i recommend this movie no you

 the movie is basically a boring string of which do not offer a real insight the middle eastern leg of the is described in a particularly way there obviously are brick tracks in the middle of the desert women in black and i wonder how and date palm trees were missing from the whole picture the of the two main characters is very and many situations are hardly credible the original idea might have been interesting but at the end

 another warner i really liked john in this though i 'm wondering why was n't in the role perhaps it was too similar to angels with faces i mean it 's another dead end kids story of sorts too but i really them here and this film had a lot of nice along with some good serious drama the boys work great with a nice was the whole scene which starts out with no but up coming too close to

 first of all i would like to clarify that i consider this one of the films i have ever seen i have watched it almost N times just because i 've to spread the of this film to other victims it has the of a hand-held camera recording of a distant 's seventh birthday it has all the writing of a match and most of all it has the of a face along a sidewalk this movie is a film 
 being that this movie has a lot of fine entertainment i think it should some more credit than it has been given on 's your basic done it ' with sex and murder but it keeps you right to the end i like these kinds of movies and i certainly think this one meets the me it was worth watching more than once so i 'll give it an N on

 i am no what i am is a and i have never felt more for a character than i felt for p. sorry if i do not offer a but i see nothing but in this film i am sure that many who watch this film will never see the same things i do but if you look hard enough maybe you will see something you were n't expecting i 've read that the character of was flawed it seems 
 this is one of my favorite films and while it may move too slowly for some it 's well worth seeing a corporate lawyer richard is dragged into a case involving city and this is no ordinary case ok a man has died but it was n't exactly a normal killing there has also been a greater than average amount of rain lately and the atmosphere of most of the film is somewhat & the are a secret and refuse 
 i watched the called black widow in the u.s.a. and felt afterward that it was indeed a truly awful movie but they must have cut quite a bit out of the original film or i missed a lot the sex scenes had very little and no not even a but i 've read several other comments on the and something about a i did not see anything like that just a bad boring film with characters and a plot is

 a movie about a love letter that puts a small town on its should be fun romantic and entertainment instead this movie is more about things not said and not expressed so it gets to the point where you are anything is said at all even if the dialogue is not exactly when the relationship that says the most is the one least seen on the screen and you know you 're in trouble but those two are a very

 it is now clear that the true golden age of american film was from the until just before the release of star wars before then there was too much with star wars the green light was for most films to be directed at children and a practice which continues to this day the truth be told contains a couple lines of dialogue we can do this the easy way or we can do it the hard way is one but 
 if you really truly want to waste two hours of your life do the following N look through the tv listings N find the movie in white ' N when in white ' comes on sit and that 's it after sitting through two hours of bad and not that funny movie and experiencing something with possibly the lowest production values ever made in recent history you will have wasted two hours of your life and wonder exactly did i 
 and now i 'm up to episode # i really was hoping it 'd be over by now not to mention canceled once everything connected with the show the actors had been dumped along with some toxic waste in the middle of the ocean somewhere never to be seen again because this series really is dire to have this program listed under the of ' is at best misleading it 's so hard to believe ben could write something this 
 at times i really wonder when i look at the comments here it seems as if most people have seen a completely different film than i have i 've just seen it and liked it not in the way that it made me happy but in the way of having seen a good film the film needs some patience yes and yes the main character is really but that i 'm sure is by it really makes a difference if 
 when you start watching this you quickly notice that it 's a european production although the europeans have integrated some of the you would normally find in an american production of this kind most are missing one of these is that there is an overwhelming evil that only our very few and very unlikely heroes can another is that one of the group is only in the business for the money is greedy runs away when the heat is up 
 being an carpenter fan i really loved this film although the do leave a lot to be and agree with many of the comments that certain areas of her life were or not touched on whatever it leaves your well and truly so off i went to discover more i must recommend a book by ray coleman the story the book is an read and unlike the film is ' and down to earth i hope you enjoy it i 
 rich joan a davis is engaged to be married to stupid allen jack carson looking lost her father eugene is determined to stop the marriage and has her by pilot steve collins james seriously they crash land in the desert and hate each other but sigh start falling in seems to be getting a high rating from here only because and davis are in it they were both brilliant actors but they were known for not comedy and this movie 
 the plot was really weak and confused this is a true in 's world all men are evil and all women are victims 
 this film is not only the last piece of the three but also the best of the three and one of the best movies of the there 's hardly another movie that so and consequently asks for and respect for every human being jacob lives in geneva where she works as a model though she has a she seems to be rather one night she has an accident and a dog and who leads her to his owner a retired 
 the N black and white half-hour episodes of the early situation comedy mr. were originally broadcast from on nbc like a lot of baby boomers this and school are my earliest memories of television since both ran later in it is hard to tell how many of these memories are actually tied to the original is worth checking out for more than its value it represents a very different style of situation comedy than shows like the and i love 
 man the ending of this film is so and dated that my entire film class like crazy now most of the rest of the film was it had a few funny scenes but had a few real good camera shots and yes is a great director who made flight of the phoenix and whatever happened to baby among others the problem is n't with direction acting or anything technical the movie is just destroyed in the third act why the 
 this is a of in the era of the and now there 's nothing wrong with using films eased moral constraints to an side to the there 's nothing wrong with the that does n't speak there 's plenty wrong with suggesting a woman who could get herself to an african in N could be this stupid and plastic has as few lines as possible when bodies are because this movie is merely a as neutral as possible so that 
 talk about being boring i got this expecting a insight into the life of the man who wrote the night on the railroad i expected to see crazy stories and of an man and to discover his for such bizarre material boy was i and chaos is mostly boring with only sporadic moments of innovative it 's certainly nothing to write home about and nowhere near as good as which is something that i suggest you watch instead leave this 
 rarely does one find a movie so bad that it the of having so little value that that alone makes it worth watching i am happy to report is such a knew i was in for something good as soon as i found the i am at least its fourth owner it has a used movie sale $ on the front and a for one dollar i picked it up at a thrift store for used movie sale covers much 
 i recently saw this movie for the first time i enjoyed it so much that i went right out and bought the this movie is pure and only gets with each anyone can write jokes or funny and have actors them but the basis of this movie is improve how do they do it you christopher guest 
 this is a film which should be seen by anybody interested in by or suffering from an eating it is an accurate and sensitive portrayal of in a girl its causes and its symptoms the girl is played by one of the most brilliant young working in today who was later so spectacular in the truth lies ' i would recommend that this film be shown in all schools as you will never see a better on this subject is 
 personally i the jerry show however i found to be the movie i 've seen this year the of jerry guests starting in the opening scene keeps you laughing throughout the movie despite a brief scene in which jerry makes a attempt at his existence i definitely recommend this movie for sheer entertainment value 
 george never caught my interest in his stand up comedy and he still does n't but this show is a work of art it 's not ever show where the jokes keep you laughing every time you remember it and jokes that at that this show just has an upbeat look to it and the characters range from an old short drunk to an i do n't know who writes this show but that person does a great job if 
 i agree with so many of the other here this was a great film and an even better novel by robert fish unfortunately i believe the author died before he could see this film made the performances are all top rate with the three principles john ben cross and seemingly made for their roles the both in europe and israel seem very and the length was just right for the telling of this story fortunately i did tape this when 
 i have n't this hard at a movie in a long time i got to go to an advance and was because i had been dying to see it i had in my eyes from throughout a lot of the movie the audience all shared my and was and throughout most of the to steve who i had already been a fan of he proves in this movie his tremendous talent for comedy he has a style that i have 
 well this movie was one of the scary movie i have ever seen the effects are so bad you just have to and the acting well lets say its no but gary who plays an police officer is so damn bad he becomes good i know how but he him makes this movie a you must see it if your in to movies cause its bloody and funny at the same time killer movie 
 plot none script a string of acting not in evidence special effects title kind of cool but otherwise exceptionally poor factor crossing the road is factor only the most desperate would onto this dog ca n't you say anything positive i did the titles were kind of cool special bonus question your idea of hell being at a party with people who voted this a N 
 i am that i actually sat and watched this i love independent films films and the whole thing in general but when you add 's you 've crossed a line that should never be crossed i hope the people in this movie had a great time making it then at least it was n't a total waste you 'd never know by watching it though script are you acting i think even the trees were well there must 've been 
 there is a certain behind this movie i was laughing throughout the scene in the phone sex office discussing how love the was a nice attempt at this execution is poor but you can see the writer 's message and they do have some talent the split at the end was like ok was n't quite expecting that but let 's see what the movie has to say certainly ridiculous but a sweet idea and actually very to the story 
 not since the made it 's debut has there been a that i did n't want to turn of in a matter of N minutes it has of course been said that the killed the not this one first season was so so as the characters were not quite as as they later became they even went to school sometimes the following seasons the character where out eric the his girlfriend the the conspiracy and the exchange student and finally 
 if this film strikes you as it did us and apparently others the theater as thin it may be because the subject herself is mildly disappointing the film presents us page as she probably was a from the rural south whose career as the queen of the universe was for her just natural fun her eventual moral conversion and sudden departure from and are accurate yet hard to understand given how she seemed by her are many reasons to see 
 veteran tv director ted post us to a confused and ultimately story lifted from column b of the harold big book of set against a phoenix smith takes a star turn as the woman whose eyes are at all times while james around the goes western are abused models lean against classic cars and smith is constantly by until a style brings the whole sorry mess to a bitter and bob is in there too somewhere 
 this movie really this is my second review because its so bad the girl on the cover is hot but the girl in the movie is not i believe it was rated r there is no violence no sex no no nothing really film 
 this title seems more like a exercise than a film that should have been released to be seen by the public for and his wife it must have been fun working together in a film for the first time without taking into consideration that people might actually watch it i felt like it was wasted as i waited for a plot to develop or even to fit this film into a and you wo n't because it lacks a beginning 
 i like the star wars series i like a good every once in a while too i even like the roger do not like the ice though for one it just looks too cheap you know for a movie that 's supposed to take place in outer space it feels and like it 's being in the front seat of someone 's mazda and the special effects while look more than anything like foam rubber painted i do n't let 
 but not this one i always wanted to know what happened next we will never know for sure what happened because was margaret 's baby i am a fan of gone with the wind and i could not have been more by the movie i did compare to the original because any film worth following needed to be on the same quality level as the first was cast although no one will ever compare to mr. i am also a 
 this is the only christopher guest movie that rivals tap and for sheer entertainment value but somehow never gets near the recognition the plot the dogs and their owners as they venture into the world of competitive dog ok it 's about a dog show the owners truly are characters as one would have to be to be so attached to their dogs that 's really all there is to it but that makes it funny 'd never be able 
 stars as ' a jewelry store thief whose grip on reality is according to the with his ' the duo make off with a of cash a result of a from beautiful ' harris her reward to a ride with the duo so that she can meet her father francis stephen but he 's on a to even a score with his former boss louis jr. and has the hot on his trail rage murder and are about to stay 
 this movie is a and vehicle the performances are generally especially by and the usually solid ed harris seems as a harvard academic the movie absolutely gets worse as it goes along it is a third rate mystery that becomes extremely by the time it the movie an excellent supporting cast george also turns up in a minor role to add some to as they debate the death penalty the violence and the atmosphere a third rate that is manipulation 
 are you me this is quite possibly the worst movie i 've ever seen the casting was horrible the acting was worse than horrible and i 'm sorry the guy at the speed his plate full of food was somewhere near and the and chamber pot chasing drew around was nothing more than when i about the bell i wanted to believe i read some literature on it and thought it sounded like it was possible a story but this 
 i mean the word seems the producers of the film to have anything interesting happen faith can do better than this she is supposed to be the torn by love for marshall thompson there 's an idea instead she 's a common would-be of the and the single flat expression she wears throughout the film makes me think they shot it all in the early morning before faith had her coffee as for the rest of the cast they are 
 people call this a comedy but when i just watched it i once i guess the problem is that i first saw it when i was N and i was n't old enough to understand that it was n't meant to seriously there were quite a few scenes that were be funny but i too much about the characters to suggest that you watch this film next time you 're falling in love and try to take it seriously i 
 maybe it was n't that good as a whole but the second episode which was the first one i say was so i still remember it today i became a fan of dick francis i would recommend it if you are interested in horse racing and of the is a lot more amusing to those of us who have never been close to hearing london 's bells but the leads are attractive and the shows were was one of francis 
 not very impressed its difficult to offer any to this film because there is almost no development in the plot everything becomes clear in the first ten minutes and from there on its like watching dry the acting seems very poor as well and me of the old black and white era films shown occasionally on chinese television although this is difficult to tell with the female role as the story seems to only require her walking round like a 
 this program is certainly my favorite television comedy australia produces very little good programs most of the tv which i watch and i live in australia is from the us and part of this show is just how controversial it is like when they went past numerous security barriers at the summit to be canadian show is made up of general discussion of current world events and sometimes these all come together to make a extremely funny tv show the 
 i ca n't believe there are actually people here who recommend this movie this is such a slow going absolutely nowhere oh ok it goes somewhere but you see that coming from miles away acting really really bad maybe the was kind of bad i the editor was told we need at least N minutes cause half of all the scenes could have gone in the music do n't get me started on that the score i 've ever heard 
 what is night vision well according to the star let 's see one package store owner says to him 's getting dark outside ' to which he replies makes for better vision ' what in the hell does that mean in fact what in the hell is this movie trying to say it has plot that you could drive the killer 's van through not to mention a on duty drinking robert through this bizarre attempt at in on the 
 being a huge fan of the bottom series i was really looking forward to the release of this was anticipating a a minute roller-coaster ride to start on this mess i think its a good start to say that its hardly and eddie on our screens in the first place as none of the jokes and one they usually deliver so well are was still waiting for the first after a good N minutes of aspects of the story were 
 how this piece of garbage was put to film is beyond me the only actor who is at all known to me is judge an accomplished actor whose presence is merely a for putting it into do n't even think it is worth a nomination for a award this film really does make b movies a a car along the freeway with police in and no one knows how to stop the car script must have been written on the 
 are we talking about the same movie this movie is totally ridiculous the plot is and completely without logic its a typical straight to including all the necessary for a horrible movie experience by has been actors side steps from the plot that are left the girl shows her why god why people do not react to things as they would in real life i 'm not even bother you with details it would take all night well ok just 
 i love the first and third but this one was an it was almost as horrible as never ending story N ' for the same reasons they took a fantasy world of creatures and a of using a and thought it would be funny to mix in our world of rock & roll i think what it was and flashy sports cars these two do not belong together i do not want to see a bunch of ancient looking people 
 i 've always liked fred her career was cut think is fun to watch pair these two major and attractive stars together add top supporting players like jean anthony and charles give them a romantic script team them with noted director mitchell and you get a movie johnson fred and meet during her visit to the panama and spend the next few weeks falling in love 's a great so he on a musical career which is predictably in both 
 return to convicted is almost the one good thing about this particular film was that i was never that being said the reviews that this movie as a success may not have watched the same movie that i than write a review and tell you what happens and what works and does n't work i will simply comment that nothing works there are plot in this movie that you can drive a through the acting in the film is not 
 in the steve put out three movies two of which are of what seems to be a very small the third how i got into college does not measure up to better off dead and this one mainly because of it 's lack of john and armstrong except for a tiny crazy summer is an movie with lots of great and as i recall steve 's movies were as being brain dead at the time and after three movies he 
 this is the best film version of 's classic tale i 've seen it over and over on and recently acquired the version which is for tv not what i find interesting about this is the cast of english actors who are now since many have appeared in other in north america since my biggest surprise is edward the as the ghost of christmas present 
 i borrowed this movie despite its extremely low rating because i wanted to see how the crew manages to the presence of multiple as a matter of fact they did n't at least so its seems some appearance cut rather into the movie that 's it this is what the majority of viewers think however the surprise comes at the end and unfortunately then when probably most of the viewers have already stopped this movie i was also when i 
 what exactly is the point of to con people out of things like ski passes and pizza i fail to see a point i 'd not or original and it strikes me as being extremely stone does n't seem to be a very or even a nice guy he has very little and just about anyone could do what he does in this show the worse thing about this piece of is the fact that a lot of the phone 
 i have to say that higher learning is one of the top N movies i have ever watched it has a brilliant cast and an equally brilliant director shows how life in university can be there are N main story lines the the and the i was by all of the stories but the one that got to me the most was the about her feelings another girl the end was great after seeing the movie N times plus i 
 this is a modest character driven comedy in brazil on a low budget the is familiar the same as in the N 's danny movie on the double someone who as a joke does an impression of a famous person then is to the person for contrast between the two leads is highly effective as the secret is tall cool and latin he sports a deliberately obvious job richard dreyfus short new york jewish is funny and sympathetic there are 
 i 've been a fan of 's since the beginning of on the food network so i have seen her grow over the years the minute i saw her with i predicted that this show would happen because i saw how taken is with her and with good reason she comes across as very natural and willing to at herself which is very engaging the set is appealing and there are some fresh ideas i love the susan that the 
 stay away from this movie at all costs i was into watching this movie in a bet to see which one of us knew the worst movie of all time to say this one won hands down it is long and drawn out and has no purpose or plot from what i can gather a movie about a killer kid raised from a that was grown outside the just has no place inside your if you are extremely and have 
 full house is one of the worst tv series ever why because all the characters are so that it 's impossible to best character is an even he is pretty that girl who wrote her character i want to kill my every time she to mention when danny start 's with his won around ten thousand dollars or more in the she 's not so she should n't gamble according to the casino was ready to pay her the money 
 wait until you 've watched most of all other films ever released wait a year then watch this when you 're ready for something with such low production values it that will not challenge anybody 's agree that whoever rated this movie as a production has to be doing it to the data anything above N would be to see the very young bullock in her hair for the short time she was featured though she the new yorker but 
 well what can one say this is far too long at N hours for the or lack of such of the plot the actors try really hard to make something of this film but there is too little content for the time available is really not a character at all after seeing 's interpretation of the great man in the league of extraordinary really does not make the grade this with the has none of the strength or needed for 
 why why why on earth no one tells the truth about this horrible horrible movie i still wake up in the morning and ask god why he did n't stopped me from seeing this comedy i believe i paid to see this to my taste i 'm starting to think that the N stars it has is because of 's and all the men who buy a film and avoid seeing this i will call it thing cause call it 
 i actually liked this movie until the end sure it was and pretty unlikely but still it kept my attention on a afternoon until the end that is for her final performance at the prestigious classical where she has struggled to to the other trained students what does the main character do them with her grasp and execution of this time musical tradition no she and the great from and turns it into an utterly pop song my and in 
 i nearly fell during a of this of a boring story that seems to go on forever it follows several days in the life of a male who falls in love with one of his after a affair the leaves a long letter explaining why they can not be together and how they must go on their separate male then goes on a downward trying to find his one true love repeatedly returning to the same places they looking for 
 badly directed garbage a if you are the sort of person who likes that see a shrink even if you are that person it does n't make this a good film the acting is really poor the story full of plot the director really should just give up and find a real job as he has no talent for this one i can see why people dislike we have had a few of his films on lately and this is 
 my behind this film despite the fact that it was free was more or less out of slight slight i was n't all that familiar with this account of mr. and discovered during the opening credits that it featured kane in the role my turned from not just but now a of mild anticipation as to how his portrayal of would turn out also in the credits among some grim photos of ed 's crimes was michael and i thought 
 this almost look at an boy who lives in the body shop area outside of new york is real all the way real lighting real sound less in the whole movie than in N minute of most movies and while there is very little script there is a story shot in primary colors almost all red white blue and yellow we get a real sense of the life of a boy who is making something from nothing he has a

 i loved this movie oh my this movie rocked so hard i found it some old tapes and did n't know what it was and after having read the back of the cover to see what the summer had to say about it which mentioned the fact that john covered the for the film more times than it mentioned what the film was actually about i thought it sounded interesting and i was even more interested in seeing it because 
 this movie was with a capital c. the opening scene showed promise but that promise was broken shortly after the where the plot is the wooden who was rather in the original film looks plain in this one it was so obviously just a guy in a cheap plastic and by the way who else thinks is one of the most names on planet earth it ranks right up there with or fred when it comes to value or why 
 being an american service member please believe me when i say that this movie in no way accurately the emotional state of our returning from being said this movie is one large pile of the acting as awful with the exception of the little girl the character 's backgrounds are weak and and plot is movie is so bad i made an account with just to warn anyone with half a brain away from should be really really really of 
 this movie is a of various and none of them fully realized and all of them rather the script was the acting the scary were mostly except for one moment that scared me even though i saw it coming a mile off now explain to me someone why you would need ghosts and black magic and and count and investigators and family and irish and of milk left out for the beings and all in the same movie with all 
 page N out of N sen enters her 's house and its empty she looks here and there and then goes in his and you get the picture another girl that and yes indeed he his two timing her but it 's a guy this time around and i say of the above scene is not a really but for me it was so i did n't want to take a chance when asked upon as how was this film 
 this movie really kicked some i watched it over and over and it never got boring really kicked some in the movie you should see the movie you wo n't be disappointed and another reason you should see the movie is because the guy from the is in it david 
 this is an early prototype of what soon became a very popular film i was happy to see william handling a story with and and without the silly attitude of his charles character from the thin man series while the story is good on its own i think what really makes this movie fun to watch is michael ' direction from a point of view this is a movie with showing an incredible command of the medium from split screen 
 feeding the is just one of many recent movies to be after your dollars suggestion keep your dollars and let 's just say that good old took one for the team on this one guess what the about taking over this time though for the of this film takes place in island and to be honest i 'm not sure i 've ever seen a based in island a tv station controlled by the government is supposedly keeping up normal 
 target is the story of a special agent who after carrying out orders to note that this is one of those american movies for guys who love movies returns home to find that his and two kids are taking charlie snow has just a couple of hours to do whatever the tell him in order to get them was by far one of the worst movies i have ever seen and had it not been for someone i know actually 
 i purchased this movie on because it promised great and music i was also a great fan of a similar movie the movie is very much after wide very similar shots with cameras set to capture long time passage in each shot even some of the scenes were identical the street with traffic told a great story nature environments and of the world in an fashion and great music this movie just jumped from shot to shot with no story 
 i know a lot of people have said do n't bother with this movie because its not a good fighting and hard with the that is a really way to think of a movie if you want to focus on that part of the movie you should go find something else and also learn to to respect as a form of art this being a piece of work if you want to watch this its not about the fighting really 
 and you can look at that statement in different ways by the way first of all it 's a mess because of all the and extremely violent scenes your does n't even come close to some of the shown scenes here entire parts of this movie are just plain sick offensive and they bring you close to your out now i love movies and i am very ' but i do think that it has to lead somewhere is that 
 back in N i saw true tom 's contribution to paris when i saw it i loved it and became it became my favorite short film and made me appreciate the format so much of course i wanted to watch the whole film and i would even check who was attached i finally saw it of the of all i must say that it looks the photography is beautiful in every short and shot at the worst being nothing special 
 hybrid of intentions and wild things but it is n't nearly as good as either of those trash it 's about the acting being called in to investigate a drug at a but to keep it on the down low as he digs deeper he thinks it 's much more than it at first seems to be we follow the girl who in as well at about N minutes if this film was welcomed to begin with it would have 
 there are few films that have had me waiting and waiting for release more than this one this is the latest film from the dead group responsible for the original film and the films this group has not been active over the last few years but this film is a reason to try and keep things up in following their film follows a group of who are trying to finish a campaign run by a gm frustrated by his group 
 the only reason i decided to view this film is because of the great acting of karen bad money who is deeply involved with gary dave cry wolf who is a great war hero and has all kinds of ways to make money and never seems to stop telling lies and dave are trying to rebuild an old home and restore it to comfortable living conditions the relationship gets troublesome and decides to find out what is going on and 
 or treat review this of a film around the N 's culture of heavy metal and movies two things which i love so as you can imagine this movie appealed to me pretty easily plus for no apparent reason plays a film is about an unpopular high school youth who like all us losers ended up in a world of evil heavy metal his favorite dies and of course is by playing his latest this allows the singer to go 
 ben & arthur could have been a sam wrote directed and produced this movie sam should have given his idea to a good writer director and left the acting to somebody who could act this is a good example of one person controlling the whole production there was nobody to tell him sam this is bad really bad 's acting was the only good point but he could have been so much better with a good director and better actors 
 i 've lost count of the times i have seen this movie but i love it and find it very funny each time i see it the humor and the timing on the jokes makes it great the characters especially and are i thought torn and bruce did a great job in fact i think this movie was perfectly cast i think it does need to be released in before i wear my version out 
 why did they make them so big why did n't they just give the money to the poor the question about was asked by a student to mr. during a school field trip to that 's a good question he replied partly to them to get them to look up with i 'm not sure that have that impact on everyone but this movie certainly had that impact on me it was it did n't start out that way for 
 while visiting with his cia tony quite a high school seen as the to lead his team finally to a victory over rival simpson is told by a would-be in the people are not allowed many books so she took up palm reading that he would be by a when the moon is full do n't make any appointments you will be well who would have it tony is in fact and his life would be forever changed after his 
 i 've been watching attack of the show for about N months maybe longer but not much i was very with and i found kevin to be very and the between them very good lately though it 's starting to wear thin due to many factors for me first my favorite segment is the first N minutes called around the net that shows N video that you would find on a site like that are generally funny or of people 
 it may have been for an audience in N but the movie is now a bit boring i had a hard time sitting through the whole thing and it was very predictable i mean we know from the beginning of the movie that is the war criminal and i 'll give you one guess as to whether he is caught and in the worth watching it 's sad that only made three movies worth seeing in his long career kane 
 of is one of the most films of all it has n't achieved a status is beyond is a tale of and which contains one of the most powerful and disturbing in the of screen the small american town some children have disappeared and their parents been is the cause of the film is really some scenes are and definitely not easily never lets up the acting is really good and the is bizarre and out this forgotten of recommended 
 once wrote that god gave to all people the ability to love the whole world but given that a human heart is very small in size every human has that special place that he more than any other it seems to me that this may have been the of some of the most directors of today when they set out to the love for that special place and situations in the lives of its and visitors the result is a 
 i went into the closer she gets knowing that it was the story of the 's mother fighting cancer i expected it to be a very movie and although the subject matter is certainly the remarkable thing about this movie is the positive message it sends it shows a family 's total to meet the challenge of cancer together they refuse to lose faith in each other even in the moments the most moving moments to me are when this 
 and film seems to have been as a and to be fair the is a bit and as drama but i feel the simple wonder and of the scenes the first impact of a new art on an and society have a and which capture the century long between and audience better than any film in years sympathetic performance from who seems to have inherited all of his hopefully without poor for and and from combine to make this a 
 anyone remember the it 's a drama which shocked britain in september N not exactly wholly by jackson 's nuclear film i could respect it unfortunately i ca n't respect this broadcast N years later which deals with letting off a bomb in the of london the problem i have with it is that director daniel production values are far too good when in fact this would have benefited from rather cheap production values the is but in this type 
 from the beginning of the film i found myself laughing trying to keep quiet so i did not wake anyone in the house this did n't continue so much throughout the rest of the film i did n't find everything completely out loud funny but still i found certain things quite funny at the beginning i had to hold in when he drops the very looking hand down his then there are scenes where you will just like when the 
 i saw this film at its new york 's high falls film festival as well and i must say that i found it a complete and awful although it was funny in some places the only real was that there appeared to be real plot to talk about and the acting in some places was and wooden especially the lovely lady and the voice of the whom i have never heard of had a lot to be was i felt 
 what do you expect when there is no script to begin with and therefore nothing that the director can work with and farrell and donaldson and are good actors they just do n't have anything to say or anything to react to even the earthquake was pretty poor and i do n't know how closely the movie follows the novel but two have the jewish girl show up out of nowhere just so show that has a nice warm heart 
 is not for his outstanding skills in fact nobody as long as they got the quite a few here to be honest scattered in the whole process thanks to 's and the dialogue puts in his this is not enough to make a great comedy since there 's no movie outside of the usual a tough guy is doomed to team up with a very character in la or there was a real story going on over the fire vs. 
 a ridiculous movie a terrible job worst ridiculous acting a story that is completely if god was going to decide if movies should continue to be done judging by this one the entire world movie industry would now be dead a wonderful movie to show that should not be done by people who think they can make am still wondering who are those two who show up in the movie for over half an hour and are never introduced to 
 two escaped step out of the woods and shoot two in the head that 's the first scene and it made me what was in store but by the end of the first half hour i was all up in the flood of images not because i in the least about any of the characters but because i was at how the film was and was to see how truly low it could and red are the after the two 
 the most bad film will be surprised by the overall of this film mary a actress best known for her roles as mary in eating and miss in rock ' roll high school is by far the best thing about this this film is almost too bad even for 
 i went out of my way to get this film and was to get it on being a big fan it was an excellent addition to my collection other than that i really can not say a lot to recommend this picture the plot is predictable and weak and the only interesting aspect of the film is watching sterling get into deeper trouble with his own department ms. is always fun to watch if you like her as i do 
 this film launched my theory about films based on books instead of following the you 've read the book now see the film if you are looking for a good book to read try one upon which a movie you like was based because it 'll be N times saw this film on its initial release at the national theater in downtown eugene and liked it so much that i stayed to see it again it 's a perfect merger 
 a and involving movie that leaves an well beyond it 's initial based on a true story one of the many small stories prior to ii that lend an understanding to the of the majority of common man by others perceived as former enemies and perhaps future foes with the of war clouds on the horizon viewed at the film festival the film was received well written and cast the characters were most and drew one in to experience their 
 is perhaps one of two where logic does n't always win out over we all know that like michael and even should n't be able to sustain the amount of pain they do and still live to fight another day most of us do n't believe that really rise from the dead to people and eat their brains and let 's hope that at least some people know that when you enter places like and old that crimes are not 
 this movie is very much like every other modern movie it 's predictable in the way it gets build up and and just never succeeds in bringing anything original or to the screen that 's really the biggest disappointment of the movie that overall still had a promising main concept for a movie of its can call this movie a big walking modern movie it has all of the elements in it that make modern movies often not so very 
 i rarely comment on films but i 've read the other comments and i can not believe that there are people this i know there are certain people who have their own agenda but lets take it on merit poorly acted badly shot and the story felt as the director was making it up as he was going along i am not going to focus on the sexual aspect of the film involving little kids as the makers of the 
 this film features two of my favorite guilty sure the effects are the story confused but just watching in his knight rider days is always fun i especially like the old hotel they used to shoot this in it added to what little was give it a N 
 i love and am willing to put up with a lot are usually and i tried to like this i really did but it is to good tv as N is to star the original silly cheap sets that does n't match the background and painfully characters can not be overcome with a ' setting i 'm sure there are those of you out there who think N is good tv it 's not it 's and while us viewers 
 this movie start quite with a female being bound and there 's male full dead animal parts dogs the female control of her all shot in a gray cold color effective but a little too much we then move on to seeing the killer 's youth as well as the present and his history of crimes the tension is entirely psychological and the scenes of the killer entering the homes of his victims and talking to them lasts for quite 
 and a load of kids that look nothing like either of and have a on a night during a vegas vacation they each come home to find that their respective children already know of the due to they and move both of them and their eight kids into one or the other 's builds furniture i think which is close enough to frank lambert 's patrick construction job on the much similar step by step to warrant is some sort 
 i originally saw this film years ago during friday after dark series back when the cable box was built like a and it me even though there is a aspect to the film it is well performances of & are very have a good chemistry together & makes a fur look movie like this probably would n't be made in these politically correct times at least not in the us since it seems to things like violence & casual sex 
 well it 's not often that we in the have a film made about inner city life from the perspective of the caribbean community the last example that i can remember was the way back in so i had high expectations when i heard about bullet boy a film that has been touted as the british version of la well la it is not i agree that the use of dialogue and environment gives this film an that has been 
 this was shown on a premium channel so i did n't it was made for tv even so i like some of the movies on lifetime here in but this was awful the family were so love you love you even more then after they were broken into for the second time N later they were at it again love you big etc she phones her husband and tells him not to bother coming home they were only broken into 
 this is the worst thing the franchise has ever spawned i was a kid when this came out and i still thought it was even though i liked the original 's this one scene i remember when the mafia guy explains to his what questions are it 's many fans hate on the series for including a female but that did n't bother me so much so that i did n't even remember her until i read about the show 
 what an extraordinary crime my wife and i saw this at the toronto international film festival last week and it was far and away the best movie in an exceptionally strong festival it 's already my second film of after dr. and i was definitely on an emotional high as i walked home and discussed the film with my do n't want to the plot because of this are best enjoyed without a that i 'd feel comfortable sharing is 
 this is easily the worst of i 've ever seen it utterly fails as an of the original silly plot and reducing the N to N or N i think it makes up utterly things to try to integrate other in ways which bring into question the writers ' having ever read the like changing birds to to the of to and bulls to a version of even aspects never seen outside of sam 's entertaining series concerning his first 
 this move was i 've seen in a while and john kick as always and the are hot too the story is lots of great jokes and whoever reviewed this before me is an to him i say that u are not of indian background so u would n't understand the humor u do n't rate movies u do n't understand what did u watch the version where majority of jokes are lost in translation what i thought is the 
 davis brings her full of to this which is another on the theme and davis are truly in acting styles and the mix is not simply but the only in the film comes from eugene who literally phones in his usual part as the deb 's jack carson 's performance can only be described as an act of on the audience 
 i actually prefer robin williams in his more serious roles good will hunting the fisher king the world according to these are my favorite robin williams movies but seize the day although is one of the worst movies i 've ever seen and certainly the worst robin williams movie even worse than death to club and on ice good story is going to have its ups and this movie however is one giant down i do n't need a hollywood 
 the energetic young producer of theatrical those staged performances usually musical that often the movie in the larger in days must deal with competition fraudulent partners & talent to realize his dream of making his mark on the closely other warner 's musical notably the films this movie had a special attraction none of the others had he is a wonder and as as any a he actually a few times during the movie the viewers attention & never lets 
 i happened to catch this movie on late night tv i saw the opening credits and thought this looks good well i was very wrong while not bad it had some funny and tender moments it lacked any sense of started off well enough with having a crisis of sorts when her husband leaves her and her is murdered but has played these women so well before think fried green the problem was n't it was the that all over 
 while it 's true that the movie is somewhat interesting the execution leaves a lot to be much like blood of the leather i on your grave and born in all superior i do n't think it 's not but is in the eye of the if it functions as for somebody who am i to say that is wrong i was rather by the statement in 's generally review such a shame that for once we actually see men 
 this is a very odd film i was n't really sure what is was about some london find a kid in the woods that they all believe is some kind of and somehow makes them all in their own way change something about their lives that usually ends in disaster the film ended after about N minutes leaving me feeling quite almost at the of it all i did n't care about any of the characters none of them get 
 's the man with the golden arm is a reference to something that must have been rather risky to film back in N years ago the today still have a problem with drug content in films lead role was originally offered to then by frank before could respond a pro card dealer and who returns home to the city only to find himself the of is one of my favorite directors his of a murder james stewart is a brilliant 
 i 've just watched roll and what a pleasure it turned out to be 's performance really stood out i found myself actually about what happens to throughout the whole of the film which itself is a lot of fun very with a good mix of well characters quite an achievement considering it 's short running time there are plenty of good throughout as well it will keep you until the end other characters to watch out for are the 
 it 's a generic story think the member of the summer of a summer place even little women and there are moments where might have omitted the music not used or played down the of the setting otherwise it 's done with rare emotional nothing 's forced every line has feeling and the is just right even the casting helps bigger movie stars with more might have the material in particular is excellent her line are fresh and original and 
 a with nothing to contribute except this is a case of sloppy seconds for 's plot less and tired mess of a is and even mildly entertaining in a dubious way but it has virtually none of the original 's intelligence or excitement instead we have just another empty of a blockbuster whose only reason to exist seems to be to the with violence which is far more than anything in the original omni consumer products who made the original 
 a good cast and they do their best with what they 're given but the story makes no sense the characters ' actions are and there are too many moments of humor as when a man is killed by being with pieces of a record or when they get the drunk to a beat and then hit her over the head with a bottle and she her and off the scene when the two and her victim played by the 
 this is the kind of movie you regret you put in your it is some weird bad off version of stephen movie N i can not understand how this movie got a score because it has no story what so ever and when the movie finally ended i was movie should have been released as a instead to much time is spent on the same thing and as in every bad movie everything happens just at the end of the 
 the power to dream is a wonderful thing there 's a saying not all achieve but all dream by exploring our we shape our own futures or build perhaps overcome our fears limitations and obstacles gain wisdom and benefit or put simply just find our way to true love and might express such things in the language of ventures out of a rather english village called wall he goes through a break in the wall a in search of something 
 ok the show was a little but i still loved it i found the main two but & were always really want the baby episodes on or even please release those specifically the years episode aired on the going up episode aired on and the minister golf episode in are the of the whole series and even over a decade later we still reference these i have nothing more to say please reduce the minimum to something like N lines 
 crimes is a story about little crimes everyday people commit that in a crazy scenario could lead to the of the series ever actors like and maria showed a whole new of themselves and talent and gave us moments of incredible ' seemed to the bad side of their in one of the characters or at least a side of their they wish they had actors of every age that played bigger and smaller parts gained an equally big space 
 this was the only time i ever walked out on a movie years later i saw it in the cable listings and thought maybe i should give it another try to say that i was right the first time this ranks second only to N as the worst movie i 've ever seen 
 is the first movie of master and surprisingly is not about or it is inside a very poor community in a in tokyo where the are homeless abused women losers i do not know the reason why selected this theme and environment to put colors but indeed they are very sad stories some of them i personally like the story of the boy and his father that dream with a house of their own and built by them the story 
 for tries to the more successful that 's bad enough but they do n't even try to make anything that closely resembles a movie here instead it 's more like a bargain clearance of embarrassing scenes inappropriate sound acting as as and a script that takes everything humans hold in their motion pictures and throws down the old plot kids track down creatures from movie lot before they kill people by projecting their sound cool does it well see that 
 the original movie the odd couple has some wonderful comic the entire world it seems knows the story of and funny madison this of created one of the most successful tv series of all time as well as not anywhere near as good odd couple movie has some wonderful jokes about 's apartment and his sloppy habits he says who wants food one of his player asks what do got says i got brown and green what 's the brown 
 i just a movie that by all rights should have been for a second rate on lifetime but trust the irish to keep it from being anything but the all but here 's a message concerning what 's truly important in life but the execution was way into the let 's see just what we can get away with here it helps to have two actors in the leads james as and stephen robertson as michael while is offered up 
 i remember this film i do remember it for the one solid reason that it is the only film that i have ever walked out on and since then i have never seen it available to rent anywhere i ca n't it for anyone i can barely remember it to think looking at the cast it seemed a winner with john but good god they must have been paid a whole lot for this all i can seem to recall 
 a well cast summary of a real event well actually i was n't there but i think this is how it may have been like i think there are two typically american evident in the film ' and parallels to these should be evident to most independent observers anyway does a great performance and so do lots of other well-known actors the last minutes of the film are and i mean it anyone who can sleep well after them is 
 van has made some excellent films i truly am a i ca n't help but feel that the edge of tom book even get the blues is lost in translation to the big screen alone tom and van are incredible and towers of talent ultimately though this one just did n't work it was n't that the characters were n't well developed or the plot and content did n't come alive it 's just that our are much more powerful 
 i am a huge temple fan when i saw this movie it made me appreciate what a child actually was rose made possibly the worst imagine an N year old playing temple from the age of that in itself is wrong but getting her to ' 's voice and her is the was good i 'll say that as previous users have said there was little dramatic scenes nothing to make the story interesting not even i would have liked 
 grey seems the of romantic leads and that 's probably the reason why this film is such a hit it 's all very well doing a version of and with like and jewish society family thrown in but there usually has to be an x probably makes this film safe with his moves and but its being won over by this that brings the dream in reach of the market the dated perhaps ' helps and of course the of 
 i just saw this movie today with my children son N and daughter at the annual roger film festival after the film the children in the audience were allowed to ask questions to the director he through a told several stories about his life and the making of the aside both of my children really enjoyed this movie of course i had to many of the for my daughter but much of the film is wo n't give anything away 
 i bought this movie exciting a over the top entertaining i got none of them this film fails on practically every level not in the least or funny it is simply terrible and never provides the audience with anything worth seeing what is so bad about it is that far from being as raw violent and as it had promised to be there is very little violence at all virtually no blood shed and no excitement acting direction and dialogue 
 a holiday on a boat a married couple an angry and a is the reason to this films like no question about that but when the main character allies with whoever happens to have the most fish at the moment mostly by having sex with them and playing the role of the constant victim my anger just rises to a whole new level take two guys a husband and another man put a pure woman in the middle of them 
 oliver stone hits the bull 's eye with this film aided by 's screen presence and brilliant every moment with a tension in a truly experience if there was ever an indication of a writer and a director 's ability to two highly volatile into a union of creativity then this is it the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our culture 's disturbing with celebrity and it 's distorted of ultimate indictment of

 i guess that everyone has to make a comeback at some point and that 's exactly what embarrassed resident jack robin williams intends to do in the best of times the man who went all crazy with the radio in good morning vietnam is playing football in this case he seeks to a game that cost his high school a prestigious title but kurt russell is n't just going to go along with it so it 's not the best

 this movie is similar to falls and the N but it 's also much more than both and not as good as 's also slow and fairly 's also got of and the we get some new age thrown in the mix and some of those scenes come off as a this movie is a of almost though it is the makeup effects are not very realistic fact they look from all that there is some really awful i wo

 i was truly and surprised at ' brother where art the video store was out of all the movies i was planning on so then i came across this i came home and as i watched i became and found myself laughing out loud the 's have made a film again but i think the first time you watch this movie you get to know the characters the second time now that you know them you hard it could hurt 
 i just got done watching the edge of love by the way this is one of the worst titles so far this year and it felt like a watching 's character made me even more throughout the of the took me four nights to watch this it was so boring the only good thing about it was murphy he 's always and is severely under looked in many films this however was just not good enough for from the characters 
 i saw this film about years ago on the late show i still remember the film especially the performance of robert taylor i always thought taylor was as an actor as most critics saw him as solid almost leading man type and women simply loved to watch his films because of his looks this film however proved what an interesting actor he could be he did not get enough roles like this during his long career this is his best 
 this a awful movie it make so little sense that it starts to make a kind of weird internal logic of its own well it would if it did n't keep off up until eventually under the weight of its own the movie ca n't make up its mind whether it is a straight forward turns into monster ' like all those incredible man ' movies or a big business conspiracy theory movie or a contact story or or what 
 consider for a moment what it must be like to be somewhere perhaps in those places that jack said do n't talk about at parties ' knows that david lean had head as a child that had more talent for film making than him and the may into him on the circuit and tell him otherwise but general audiences find the 's output so of or that he 's become the 's an for does his best to ride over 
 this solid black and white comedy with a dark but plot is a true crowd that will have you with as well as rolling your eyes with 's the old on a train story but that is of no big importance as the portion of the film almost seems to be merely a to the of the great robert his nearly optimistic both and in a fashion that almost rivals chevy thing about the film that appealed to me the 
 i just finished reading a book on ' work and the photo in magazine of macdonald in her looked great impressive wings so i thought i 'd watch this movie i 'd never heard of the film before so i had no about it thought it got off to a start with as the and macdonald as the secretary he does n't know exists the scene where she shows up at the party in her simple outfit with an and 
 looking back on the year N one of the things i will remember most is the on the for a film called on a unknown to me there was a film called on a train after seeing this i feel its at best a plot a husband and wife get on a train to go to los to get help form the uncle who is a is because the wife 's family do not approve of her him so they 
 do n't get me wrong i love david as i love the series as well as the movies but enough already death on the everyone has done this one we know who dies we know why they die we know who the killer is we know how it was done so i say enough already mr. could have used that talent in another one of christie 's novels i will say that the acting by all the actors was the 
 this movie is awful at first i thought it may appeal to children due to the the little people from stars wars after sitting through this of a movie i am certain that not even a would find this movie interesting the special effects are by far the best of this movie and compare well for other tv movies the script is bad the actors especially miller and bad and the is so predictable that i still ca n't believe 
 i have been waiting for such an original picture such as this for quite some time now palace has that hard to believe ' aspect however with the and scores big i 've really never enjoyed watching in any of her movies but i 'll tell you what she really changed my mind with this one kate joins on a vacation to thailand where they meet up with a young man who them to take a trip to hong kong 
 i do n't think i 've really ever given walter his due as a performer he 's certainly been wonderful in plenty of roles but i guess i always put his success down to his characters ' and a contrast to the flamboyant of his frequent jack and i a natural extension of his earlier work in dramatic pictures watching gene saks ' odd couple N ' adapted from a popular neil simon play the suddenly is in his own 
 i went to this movie at a cast and crew show cause my friend whom is a producer on the movie invited me forget what you have seen in the commercials forget what you have heard go see this film for yourself i was more than surprised by it in a world of the angels the day here comes a film that is worth your hard earned scenes wonderful and a cast you want to eat with your heart i 
 now i 'm one to watch movies that got poor reviews and say this is n't so bad i loved the cable guy and thought that my big fat independent movie was great keep in mind i really did n't start watching this with high hopes but i figured that maybe just maybe it would be bad in a kind of way i could at it i was wrong at no point at all during my suffering through this film 
 although it is more of a kids movie it still holds its own especially when compared to the more recent assembly line films being made the music is i do n't care how old you are you will still find yourself to of rock and roll and diamond a must for 
 quite simply the and of all time it 's certainly on my personal list this one also gets a solid ten on the voting scale heir arthur moore is a ' who refuses to take the mature path in life and all responsibilities he also refuses to leave the bottle one day he and his personal butler go shopping at goodman 's and run into linda arthur and linda 's chemistry adds electricity to the rest of the film there 
 this was directed by a true to many film fans after he directed the and notorious however do n't expect to find any such in the film reviewed here as it proves to be in comparison and plays more like a inspired for a young a may instantly put off most fans of the whole inspired & but before you turn your nose up at this it has to be said this movie is just so much fun it 's 
 deep is more like it the are just in over the film think the incredible mr. meets very character or relationship development so called romantic scenes very and predictable an interesting idea but a poorly written script and special effects make this a 
 francis ford 's was a great ending for a golden decade of american in the there was an atmosphere of and among the studios that allowed the making of major films by a few of the best directors that the united states has ever had i am not a but all the events that the decade a few being the violent deaths of major figures of the american political and cultural scenes the racial struggles the emergence of the the 
 i can understand why others reacted rather the yielding a twist that really is hard to take seriously i think though that the to it works rather well the music quite and really provides a matching the sound of a constant ringing telephone that is driving struggling english actress joan jean marsh she 's borrowing a 's nice apartment while attempting to her career in new york city the city buildings outside the window look about as realistic as david 
 this film is a perfect example of great i loved this film and was in from the very beginning sure it 's just an action but is n't having fun what watching movies is all about the cast of this film are very strong with characters the friendship between the boys is so realistic and appealing it 's heart warming and to see a group of boys especially this group of boys makes a great rebel successfully avoiding being a 
 having watched this movie on the channel i can only conclude that this film was made by a bunch of who have never seen a movie in their lives the film is an endless of bizarre or as the friend reading over my shoulder is telling me the plot is n't really worth commenting as but basically a plane carrying football players crashes into territory before the movie is over we are treated to hearts out in an effort to 
 this is one of the best of the N 's put on film arthur penn director of and and little big man saw that steve 's outstanding script with truth and from these two comes solid 's georgia miles gives male viewers a hit of for the beauty who is almost within our but always just out of reach just see it or you education will be incomplete 
 baby this is indeed some fine asian and a crazy movie this is a japanese that reminded me a little of except in this case with all the blood and there is a bizarre love story it 's hard to imagine how they even up this stunning movie with some unique creatures that humans as turning them into part machine or i guess the only thing wrong with these creatures after they take over a human is they need to 
 if you are a fan then you will probably enjoy this if you do n't know who or are this is not the movie to start out with it 's very silly the are hot and it 's fun to watch there 's no sex until the very end of the N minute film but the score is and the plot 's not a total 's makeup is bad in this movie and her hair is in so she 's 
 i thought that my favorite was very boring and drawn out it was not funny at all the audience just sat through the whole movie and did n't at all not even the kids that is sad for a disney movie i thought they could have found somebody better to play the rather than christopher lloyd he was really stupid and he was not funny i thought the talking suit was really in the original television series the suit does 
 everyone is entitled to an opinion the only critic who counts is yourself i think this is a great movie much better than the is funny but he was asked to do the but things got in the way mason shows the saying that less is more he is funny but a man with real family issues a more person it 's no drama but a movie that makes you feel actually in some points you feel sorry for mason 
 i have n't seen hardware wars in years but i remember it as one of the most events of human experience and it was over far too soon every aspect of this movie was and it was even better than star wars i i after watching it i asked a family member for a moment with three dollars just so i could it i 'm about the last one i love it when 's tries to eat anne 's hair 
 the return is one of those movies for that niche group of people who like movies that and them at the same time plays a who does not kill or get naked at all throughout the movie i was willing to put up with this however i was not willing to put up with the worst ever combined with at the end it turns out she crashes her car into herself when she was young or maybe i 'm wrong

 i grew up watching inspector it was and still is one of my favorite if not my favorite i learned a lot of geography and history from the inspector 's field trip i wanted to slip on a and become the greatest the film has the reputation of the wonderful broderick an actor with potential was definitely not the role for inspector first in the film inspector is smart not so in the in the film the mystery mostly by 
 first of all that i would like to say is that edison is extremely hot and that sam lee is looking much better than before this is probably one of the most original movies i have seen so far shows a poverty background of a the edison goes around killing people to survive himself has done it throughout his entire life sam lee 's duty is to capture the for good there are tons of violent actions but has a 
 how could N out of N prior voters give this movie a N how could more than half the prior voters give it a N or higher who is voting here i can only assume it is primarily kids very young kids the fact is that this is a bad movie in every way the story is stupid the acting is hard to even think of as acting the characters are and the dialogue is terrible i saw this one 
 let 's see characters like have forced a scientist to perform some exotic drug tests on some people who have been and you 'll be sure to when these for get their just turns out the drug experiments have given them the ability to sense another world the world of fantasy complete with who look like they are made of everybody gets dragged off to hell except for one poor who goes to where he can presumably spend with the

 maybe being a government bureaucrat is not the most glamorous way of making a living but it 's still a way to make a living however after watching this movie one may come away that every government bureaucrat is a bloated paper who lives exclusively to of his next lunch break not exactly a pretty picture but this is the picture that the audience has to endure when watching what is nothing more than another action movie just what the 
 many people see this as a classic but i obviously must have missed something life in texas in the early N 's is pretty which means that a movie about life in texas in the early N 's will be pretty too what is it that so many people see in this once the last picture show in closes there really wo n't be anything to do in town jeff bridges makes that point at the end of the movie 
 the most notable feature of this film is the chemistry between the actors the sense of in their dialogue and this typical musical has an plot even for N but because of the actors it 's still fun to watch is n't even that much of a but she has a lot of ' that fits her character kelly plays his usual role while provides plenty of and the movie can also be very serious at times not a but 
 obviously has some talent attached maria is always great but this is just a of time portraying every character as someone to be and so someone could make a movie out of an ' story well i hope they got it out of their systems unfortunately for the audience there is no insight no no context and really no which would all be fine except it has no humor no no context and nothing to say about the story it 
 those of you who know the group know the lead singer tom he directed this movie a bit like he creates music it 's a mix of everything this is a comedy though mostly absurd and a drama none of the main characters have a happy life to say the least and it does not really have a movie starts on a friday morning in belgium with scenes of several persons some of them have nothing in common but they 
 it is interesting to see what people think of this movie since it is in fact quite unique though it bears some of the of 's writing even though it might seem a bit to say so the movie is just enough to those that need standard hollywood plot and so that if you expect to be fed you will see a normal monster with lots of and a who need a linear specific and plot line will hate this 
 where do i begin i wanted to enjoy this movie and i did still i wanted to be able to enjoy it for being another film that was worth my and it this was a different kind of this was a that i in watching one of the most ridiculous films seen yet and i much care for whatever 's were there was no excuse for this film going how it went this was a bad film all the way 
 a lot of the user comments i have seen on the for this movie do n't really do it justice first of all let me just say that this movie is not to be taken seriously it 's supposed to be a fun yet stupid movie that does n't require one to think only to enjoy it if you watch this movie with the intent to see a in either or in then you will be disappointed yet if you

 a without feeling a drama of issues without point or drama this film is supposed to be all these and fails on each and every account as if it is n't trying or as if the team is n't really trying the actors are able they need better element that does n't fail is the score by george beautiful and moving what a shame it 's attached to this film in a good film actors ' words and movements and 
 i have watched this movie at least N times maybe more and each time i watch it i am drawn into the movie and back to N the movie takes me on a vacation every time i watch think the important thing to say here is i was N in N and i can remember before president kennedy was shot and before the came i can feel myself saying something like i carried a and then just how stupid that

 but just plain not bad for a film i was reading how people switched it with the michael version and that is a good in my opinion because some grown ups hate and when they see this one it will get them interested in films like this one or maybe never seen it the possibly comedy uncle sam i 'll have to see about or buying that film but the is way better then this one but i bought this 
 bread very sharply the of movies in general and night of the living dead in specific and is constantly the production values are a little rough at times it 's a student film after all but it never loses sight of its goal to george liked it enough to include it on the dead video tape and that should tell you something 
 i watched this series after i had seen the naked gun films i found it much better than the films and i thought the films were great this series literally you to the television set in anticipation of the next sight or funny situation the all night place club i do n't think i 've ever as hard at a tv series in my life even after seeing the movies first and thus knowing some of the jokes i think 
 i this thinking it might be interesting and it might have been an interesting story except that is was told in such an manner hard to follow strange the characters all in all a waste of time i just could n't get into it and did n't care what happened to the characters not even ian could save this film unless you need a cure for i 'd it and that 's being generous 
 this is another typical and piece of hollywood russell as in a business suit me he was a better ray as the is totally predictable and absurd is her usual and does little to be a convincing scene in this is absolutely predictable all the way to the end when kurt ray with a or something knocking him down and out kurt and then do their and everybody except russell and knows is going to get back up and the 
 ok when i saw the for this movie i thought it looked really scary and was quite excited to see it as were the group i was with now living in america especially during this election i see some very things but i have to say these were the top of list i do n't see how so many people could be scared by this movie i only really noticed two real jump scenes and only jumped at one the 
 when i was a kid i totally loved both bill & ted movies the other night was on and since it was at least N years since i last saw it i decided to tune in and i loved it all over again this film is still funny after all those years ' is better but this one rocks just the same sure some of the are a bit but this entire film is in a cool way plus it 
 this movie is based mainly on the and of people there are only three locations the school the store and the coach 's house that are really used it 's primarily at the coach 's house however a movie does n't need special effects or amazing views to be amazing in friends who had during their basketball days meet up one is rich important and has no real love outside of money one wants to be mayor again but his 
 while i do n't consider myself a big fan of tale movies me based on seeing pfeiffer in the as a especially since i was about to see her as the von in boy is she so evil here as a especially with her makeup in the beginning and end robert de is also great as the who 's forced to hide in the to protect his reputation just about all the actors like rupert peter and many others do 
 can i please say first of all that i felt so strongly about this movie that i signed up to specifically to review it and my review this is easily the worst movie i have ever of the movie sounded time travel etc. but the movies plot failed to properly bring all these elements together remember the episode of south park that featured writing family guy using balls ' did these also write its like the writer wanted to include 
 i am of myself that i actually went to the theatre to watch this movie when it was first released while i its of the and kennedy story is well enough done it 's a movie that should never have been made in the first place hence my low film the tale of a wealthy business called who and wins the lovely young widow of a american president sound familiar yes everything except the cast is not to be anthony

 this is probably the most film i 've ever seen i watched it because i have a soft spot for leon everything else has done has been just awful in my opinion with the exception of the script for and jean it 's a to just how bad this film is that one of the most and actors he 's just starting out here ca n't make this film or the moments in which he is on screen 's all 
 although i can see the potentially in this film by way of it 's i most certainly thought that the painfully long nature in the way the scene structure played out was too much to ask of most viewers enormous in the such as the never explained your father died today comment by the mother made it even harder to try to make sense of these won first place at in N which is a shock considering perhaps the french 
 not a knock on as he was very funny on the carol show he was also good at playing secondary characters in brooks ' movies high anxiety comes to mind he is however not a person who can carry a movie in roles no less this one is basically a following a tradition of such movies as and it is not a very good either on par with but with a much lighter tone to it as it is no

 this movie has got to be one of the worst i have ever seen make it to the story line might have if the film had more funding and writers that would have cut the nonsense and scenes that i highly caution parents on but the story line is like a loose if there was such a thing as a drive movie one would have from reminded me a lot of the films that were put out in the N

 while all of the studios are excellent billion dollar limited the third in the series is probably the best of the lot in terms of overall plot and why it was n't even for an as best short for N enough only the first one was in lane is assigned to cover the transfer of one billion dollars in gold to the u.s. mint in their for N car take off after the train determined to get that gold without

 when i first viewed this movie i did n't know the title of it i realized it had chevy chase in it with the same name he had in so i had an idea this was at the end of the movie when i did find out it was N i was disappointed they could have done better dan i thought was bad the whole story was bad call this movie by another title but do n't call it you 
 margaret mitchell in her grave every time somebody watches this mess fine and sets ca n't even begin to lackluster performances by as the title character and the timothy as even worse than the acting and perhaps partially explaining it is the script which is and predictable add to that bad script a score that 'll have you and you 've got a disaster i would n't wish on any is just and i ca n't imagine how it ever 
 they told me it was bad but i had no 've started a tradition we found one copy of this movie and we just pass it from person to person whoever has the movie watches it and then passes it to someone else deemed worthy of seeing this unique creative horrible movie hopefully it 'll travel the world a few 's painful really painful it 's even beyond so bad it 's funny well sometimes it 's so bad it 
 i loved this film it may not have had the funding and advertising that the latest hollywood get but it twice the emotional the tale around this one family from utah and it 's the connections between the people in the family that provide the film with its the main lead giovanni plays his part very well at no time does he leave you to believe that he 's acting all his feelings it 's his brother who the show 
 an american boy goes to paris after his mother becomes and artist and then himself and returns to the states so he can make things right with his former have to think that the people who are rating this movie so highly are all fans even though there are no aliens or serial in it do n't be this movie story is with little or no explanation of what people are doing or why when you do get an explanation 
 one thing i 'll say off the top is i 'm not the biggest fan i 've actually seen a fair number of his works thanks to a the film festival had and i found his films just a too for my so i went into wary of what i was going to see boy was i knocked out ' is 's attempt at a musical using the elements of japanese opera mixed in with many modern elements both and 
 excellent film i when she i loved when they loved i was frustrated when they were this film touched my heart it was a reality check for me since this is reality for me a N year old 
 there is nothing like an comedy and this movie is nothing like a comedy the from scene to scene and the comedy is completely in the original story the humor comes from the americans who are to the of chase the american father even offers some oil to the ghost to quiet the chains read the book 
 other have detailed the plot and the social and commentary as well or better that i could but i would like to join in my for this little of a film it holds up very well indeed more that N years later in every category acting photography set design sound design it really is a classic of sorts this was my first exposure to the young guinness and it 's obvious from the first what made him so special as 
 this show is sheer entertainment and does n't try to be a drama it certainly contains elements of one what with all the plot but it 's engaging and fun las vegas is the perfect setting for a show and they will certainly never have a lack of material to work with anything and everything does happen there the actors in this show are extremely and you really do want to see what they are up to and into each 
 there is no doubt that during the decade of the the names of and became a sure guarantee of excellent performances in high quality films after being universal 's first monster in the classic became the thanks to his elegant style and his foreign this last factor would also led him to be during the in the same way 's performance in james 's transformed him into the man to look for when one wanted a good monster of course 
 this show is the worst show ever and his family write it produce it direct it etc etc the only reason i ever see it is because my wife likes it how many times can fly though the air from plain sight to land a kick on an obviously blind no trees no building just thin air he always the case or is the best at whatever there is no co star ever gets the glory its all its truly 
 the man a common problem among movies based on saturday night live and that is a that usually succeeds in five minutes will not do so well in minutes although this movie does have its like tim as leon phelps a straight out of the and will as a husband by leon so this movie is funny enough but it 's no wayne 's world 
 this film is full of interesting ideas some scenes are truly the are and the tension in the film comes not so much from the mystery ' plot as from the relationship between the characters the film tells two stories in first story involves the characters played by and is an with a somewhat ridiculous who is followed by a young man played by with plenty of many good moments in the film come from the contrast between the two 
 what is it with americans and their with to think this was a novel is incredible but to pull it off as a movie you really need good acting and a script that in this case all the good actors have gone to and we 're left with kirk as a journalist trying to discover why a lot of people have simply disappeared oh there 's a about an evil world conspiracy and or something the good news is that 
 if you have any kind of heart and for people this is a tough movie to watch at least in the second half of it it 's in that segment where we see nice little kid get beaten up and then a challenged man go off the deep end after he witnesses this act against the child it 's not it 's a good movie and the acting is good too the story will sit with you is the guy 
 just finished watching this one after getting sick of getting ready for the michigan bar i wanted something that was and that i could just sit back and say what the hell were they thinking i was not disappointed in this undertaking but had i been watching this one in a serious mood i would have been the company that made this thing just from the first and added a little with a fake that makes the one used in 
 ok enough already this is a terrible piece of television the camera work is do i have to you of the so loud you can hardly hear the actors speak lady has the most voice in the entire world is ' in such an fashion and the lack of chemistry between and is beyond beyond also the are n't pretty enough and the guy playing henry is awful to say the camera work is is an i watched this over 
 me being from australia and the series i was n't expecting much from the american version of and kim but i thought i 'd watch the first episode to see if it was really that there to say its nothing blair is ok as kim and actually had a few good lines shannon is not a good though the good thing about turner 's is that when she speaks with all her funny such as when she says or it 
 possibly the worst film within the in existence it was announced as a comedy but is simply i do n't think anyone could have achieved anything more terrible and if they were specifically requested to it is toilet at its very poorest i would avoid even watching the i only went to see it because it was announced that if you like you are bound to love this whoever wrote that was either or seriously i am still how one 
 awful despite the good performance of ed harris and the strong budget the reason for the N stars the movie is by far the worst i saw about a and the worst edition of a of music i agree with some stuff to upgrade a that otherwise could n't be so this was done in with best results but this b copy here is a flaw had a strong but was a artist here in this movie however he looks 
 like another i really wanted to like this movie i went with my father who was the biggest and of classical music but neither of us could stand this movie i would n't even call it a movie a better might be a record of a few chamber concert pieces as i recall the camera never even moved rather i just sat on a for the of each piece the only attempts at dramatic effect were at the very end

 i wanted to love this movie how could i not love it grant stanley all in their own way however the train that was parker the entire experience for me her acting was so that i sat there with my hanging open not my eyes or i could barely make it through one that 's how she is in and in fine dramatic form and obviously having a ball the supporting cast does and the city of san francisco is 
 if you are already a fan of peter 's wonderful books from the you will really enjoy this movie if you have ever seen the N film forget it that was camp this is the real the story and character are both true to the that fans of the books know and love it 's a long way from joe 's N and it takes our quite seriously is quite good and in the part and yes we do get 
 watching on screen is like watching a master carpenter details into a piece of 's acting is the only thing that makes this movie the plot is and not comic the other big name actors seem to be making desperate attempts to give the characters they some of these characters have the of everything about the technical side of this film is either or just plain awful the director throws and shots about with the music is and any hint 
 larry clark is not for his as a writer or a director but he has made some important films kids and to a lesser extent ken park all achieve their intended purpose shock and even these films are in their content and use their controversial nature to very serious problems in modern youth kids exposed us to the proliferation of and sexual among the young touched upon similar issues ken park dealt somewhat with sexual abuse and suburban all of

 to the max neither title reflects the serial 's actual content fighting in actually the iverson ranch the plot is just to fill in the between the packaging claims over N ' in N that 's at least three a chapter aside from seeing cast as a spanish watching how much furniture is thrown burned or up is what this serial is really all about when the start fighting you can bet that everything in the room will be in 
 this is a film that has it all the hero the beautiful in the noble figure with the flaw and a truly wonderful robot planet has maintained that special magic over the years and does n't lose its flavor with repeated although the sex appeal of the anne francis helps considerably on that score fans will recognize the leslie nielsen portraying the and adams although those of us who have grown of him in roles will perhaps be a bit 
 the idea is a very smart title the film has a serious in feel to it but it is so you do n't know how to read it are these guys doing a full comedy or is there something else going on the little dialogue the film has is n't very delicate and this adds to the power of the film if all the sound was switched off from the film it actually would n't take anything away from the 
 this film 's basic is a political i for those who know nothing about the realities of the military this is probably a film on indeed a recent stated it lets women know that they can do anything they want to do what no one man or woman can do anything they want to do and unfortunately moore up for seal hell week in the early N week program by a few sessions at the local and her desire alone 
 i get and his but at the same time i feel his is largely and more than a little disturbing because the supposed he crumbling architecture etc are by the absurd and downright way that the characters in the pursuit of many but their and painfully line delivery gives the whole a and feel and frankly many of the people are painful to look 's is disturbing to me at least because of the casual and homosexual content not because

 and star in a romantic drama about an played by who ends up carrying for her when her sister is killed in a car crash while she 's out taking care of family matters she 's replaced by tale with no chemistry between the leads she 's a dead fish and he 's but not much of anything watching this i was wondering why anyone would want to see this since ' character is so come on she 's so 
 i was looking forward to seeing two bright young actors appearing in john but it was very slow moving and i felt that both the and the direction hampered the flexibility of the principle performers i usually do enjoy film of these novels ironically i did think the movie did an excellent job of realistic military was very good at through love letters focusing just enough on a key word or phrase in each letter i felt that became down 
 i have two very major complaints regarding this that my local rental store what is very clearly a soft core in the category had i known what it was i would not have wasted my time it in the first place and yes this movie is a soft core N the title has nothing to do with the movie no one in this movie does anything that is either or let alone a combination of the make that three major 
 this is a classic with a big named cast mostly seniors who were well past their prime and in this is quite a film when you think about it remain on earth and you will face illness and eventually your showed that she could still dance too bad the movie did n't concentrate more on that looking still displayed those steps from queen of the star dust so much more down to earth from N years only hope that this 
 have i ever seen a film more i can think of plenty that equal this one but none which manage to it the cast are all horrible with flat dialogue i am for all of the people involved in making this each one wears an expression of fear not generated by the plot but by the that this project could easily their career even the many of ms. do n't provide an adequate reason to subject yourself to this avoid 
 this is one of my N favorite movies i 've been out on the water since i was N so i got a lot of the humor as well as recognizing a lot of the the movie although taking place in and around virginia was around the san francisco bay most notably the fleet just east of the bridge where 's character was first introduced to the and the of san francisco at the very end of the movie including 
 horrible horrible tv show why comedy central decided to repeat old episodes of this program is beyond me it really i am of course speaking about the seasons after the first two the first two seasons were golden and if i was exclusively talking about those seasons this show would have gotten eight out of ten stars none of the appearing after the first two seasons who were not part of the original cast are any good they were and 
 though some would prefer to comment on the value of bond movies in the connection of learning frequency and while most of the that tends to limit bond to a N following has been beyond all reasonable there are several that extend the credibility of in this doubling role that had seen its counterpart in part of a previous performance by tandy in driving miss while had been less visible in the latter his had maybe not cast a on 
 when i saw vs. a few years ago i have to say as stupid as a it was it was still somewhat now there are unfortunately a shortage of good movies out in the theater lately so my and i decided to just go ahead and see what aliens was about so we saw it a couple nights ago and i have to say that there was absolutely nothing about this it took a completely different turn from the first 
 name became prominent with away however what is often are director 's first film efforts who that directed or george directed N i remember seeing of this movie almost certainly the last N minutes in late and what stuck with me was the of the design and so when i found a copy in a well known store for i could n't resist but buy it the odd thing is that the last N minutes of the movie do not 
 my wife and i saw this when we were the only good thing my father ever did get us in this is our movie and the music is our 's song is our song it 's a crime to show naked children on the screen but we were at N why not these kids the movie rich boy poor girl then rich him away from her at the end after she gives birth under conditions she is left alone with 
 as interesting as a sheet of this period piece has little going for it it 's overly and fails to the tension and fear that the characters must have felt as they the french revolution 's hand of justice eric at N it shows 
 's john mission is to a oil minister whose name happens to be in the country of which is run by american interests as trade show producer to allow him to get to a can be so it becomes most here it does too much the government politics music war people not generally accepted by society and did i mention war and that is what we have here a most movie that borders on a very bad nightmare brought to 
 now my friends films like la the or only can be done in the old continent in this film we see all horses sex kind off sense etc etc etc in the serious terms now its an that men sometimes could be and the director shows us the loss of sexual violence rape and its a experience bizarre and full of scenes for all fans of european i recommend this you like this one i recommend against the man and 
 i am a fan of his this movie really bad even worse than & that movie was bad it was kind of like they it out in a week looked to be very low budget only like N or N buildings used a couple of locations maybe & poor everything it just 
 i see quite a few positive reviews on this board trying to revive this film from its lackluster status and starting a following i see the usual i guess this movie is just not for the easily this movie is not shakespeare etc guess what neither was road trip and i my a off during that movie there 's a way to make a crude comedy and deliver and there 's a way to just make it crude and tries 
 first of all is the best actress in this movie and she 's just awful this movie has every move in and all badly played the couple the not the cool the local color guy the couple the who never dies in these films the dialogue is so painfully awful and delivered with the of a pool it 's almost like you 're that they 'd all die sooner i saw the rough cut of this film a while ago 
 is an outstanding actor i really think he gets into his character when gets shot he shows true he also shows true when puts the gun to him in the room is a very actor 
 a big waste of time is all you 'll get out of this bag i this hoping for a movie with maybe a few scenes but boy was i ever i think the title should 've been N or something to that effect well anyway stay the hell away from this film it you to death do n't be afraid of big foot be afraid of this 
 this is actually a of N of 's short the first one is the which is about N minutes long and very after N years albert is laid off from his church job because he ca n't read nor write so what does he do opens a tobacco shop of course the second is mr. which was actually a story i had read for school N years ago and instantly forgotten until i heard the familiar introduction another N minute 
 i loved this film post is really great in it i saw it on lifetime and it 's in the same entertaining class as films like broderick story ' up a mother 's rage ' etc which by the way are also very good entertaining films it 's an over the top drama about a single mother who tries to break away from her middle-class predictable this movie is just pure entertainment it does n't have to be a realistic 
 i ca n't think of anything i repeat anything positive about this movie the whole N hour N minute movie could be into a short movie in most scenes there is absolutely nothing going on and it seems just the camera was left on recording on purpose only to increase the time of the movie all you see is someone in the background walking around or watching tv with no specific subject or even talk what so ever i just 
 i 've been a devoted for a few years this is the movie that finally me to write in a caught this movie by chance the opening credits happened to be past when i turned my tv on one morning i enjoyed the film for many reasons all of which have been well covered by other the the forgotten history of the pilots the of the supporting characters the of the main characters and the first person view during the 
 drive made me the definitive fan of david lynch he 's a modern because he 's not only a his stories and his style have a that cross the screen so the straight story was quite a surprise to me with its easy to follow and sets still lynch is there and while this is far from his best it 's a film not to be missed late richard 's performance is one of the 
 at first i thought who writes these things how hard is that choice between a man who offers you and your children wealth respectability and security as opposed to a husband who offers you only abuse and poverty however our choices are not always as clear cut cut as one would think indeed the wealthy was all a woman could to and yet the pull of her husband her sexual desire for him was almost overwhelming what to do what 
 this movie is true action at its it does n't get any better then this this is one of those movies that you can just kick back and watch some real good stop shooting and killing plus there are some excellent lines to go along with all of this my favorite is there is a one bad guy who is breaking into this old couples home and he is stealing a tv or something and he goes right up to 
 i channel past this many times mainly because the sounded so so love american style however it turned out to be quite good very well done the two features are the and acting great cast the is actually well executed and there are n't too many weak moments i guess what i was most by was how often you thought the wheels are going to come off the and instead the just banks the turns so to speak and the 
 for those too young to remember or too old to have been part of the the michael jackson fad in the N 's was at a fever like the about except this just did n't let up every song every video every word by michael was important nothing similar had been seen since the of the remember seeing this video for the first time at a roller everyone stopped there was no question as to whether you were a michael 
 this movie could be used in film classes in a how not to script a course there are inherent in a budgets are tight time is precious was apparently shot in N days and the actors are often green and the one aspect you have complete control over is writing the best script you can within the limitations set before you 's script seems to have been written in a i could go through about examples of the of this 
 this is a that covers no new ground all the and is sloppy with facts for example is a very flat city so why is it in the movie for example the end of the great war in N was not a surrender but an yet it is announced as a surrender for example european news vendors did not and do not as they their papers yet this strictly american custom is employed in the film for example the did 
 and together again this is one of those films that casual fans will pass over and tend not to appreciate as much it 's not an film like the duo 's previous two hits the black cat and the but it is very worthy of both 's and is a fun film when ray was directed by lambert a director who mainly made but in these final days of the ' at universal he found himself this and the ' 
 i really enjoyed the performances of the main cast lung is and interesting the director has developed performances where the characters are not one a complex story with the changing between also the underlying story of the unions losing power and the effect of a large employer closing on a small town i do not agree with the comment that the older man has to be attractive there have be many relationships with older men and younger women without the 
 it is high time that american critics and fans alike start to their sloppy of films like 's upon a time in america ' the history of this film and the grand associated with it 's production and many versions its on a level the film and forward in fits and starts its central figures and seemingly out of place surrounded by the of sets the of production detail and the by N 'd but on offer to the audience 
 ok with in it i should have known better but N you 've encountered N from other movies & and tv shows N van should have by now N you 're feeling sorry for tom ' jr. that he has been reduced to doing movies like shows up looking like you 're ready to shoot you 're how these movies receive funding is beyond me and yes i watched the whole thing the ending is just stay away 
 beautiful attracts excellent idea but with a bad selection of the actors the main character is a loser and his woman friend and his friend upset viewers apart from the first episode all the other become more boring and boring first it considers it behavior no one normal would not the way the main character it all represents a typical way to viewers to the reduced amount of intelligence does such a scenario or the casting director and destroy this 
 what people fail to understand about this movie is that it is n't a beginning middle and end it is just the conclusion of a N episode long tv series so remember that when you all talk about how the world was n't enough that was all done in the tv great and stunning as the are i think the argument between and near the end of the film was what really made me love this movie seeing characters i 
 this film is a bit of the german film the story because a child is to a strange land in order to be a hero however due to far superior modern technology and are used to make an realistic looking world one that will blow your off due to its and enjoyed this film but boy was it a at first unfortunately for most this film is one you might give up on very quickly or dismiss it since everything 
 this show me it takes up on at that could be reserved for the fresh prince or george even full house and they 're all better than home improvement first off the mother me so much she is an baby and i really her is a fat and he is too and the youngest brother i do n't even know his name i do n't notice him at all that 's probably not the actor 's fault though it 's 
 the cover art which features a man holding a scary gun would make it seem as if it 's a arts film hardly i find it interesting that the film 's real title is is a brand of in the us this movie is loaded with if you like that stuff then this film is n't that bad really however consider these points there are numerous of actors ' & one scene even features every actor with an in his

 deceptive advertising i saw a commercial for way rise to power that states from the producer of and 's way lets get it straight michael did not produce in fact he was room assistant ' for not to take away from 's talent but in my opinion he should of had a little more class i think i can speak for the when i say we hate being to as far as the movie goes it was poor at best 
 this show uses a rather tired formula of the fat blue collar with the pretty and sometimes wife and crazy s with this show it 's fat kevin james as doug who works as a delivery driver for a parcel service he has a pretty wife who works as legal assistant and arthur jerry who lives in his daughter and 's kevin james ' doug is your typical beer drinking sports tv watching of a husband who would rather watch 
 when i first watched this show on network i found it then i read a lot of good messages about this show and i decided to watch it the show was so boring each episode was predictable more this show has no logic who are going to school and sometimes do such stupid things N of episodes start with a monster attacking then mayor he is a real fool he is not funny he is so stupid that i ca

 i thought this movie had absolutely no moral i mean how would you feel if your left you on your day for your i would be it 's classified as a comedy but i did n't find it funny at all i thought it just mostly found cheap and took them i normally love movies but this is an exception lee stars in another show which once again proves that class and decent are not relevant in society it had 
 or that 's what the would like you to believe movie tries hard to be cool it 's ridiculous everything from the look of the film the the the dialogue and the acting is geared in cool mode from the get go just to make sure that no one misses how cool this film is there 's a of really cool rock roll and a playing constantly throughout the film as a final reminder of how cool this movie is 
 this is an installment in the notorious guinea series a short lived japanese that got after a admitted to being inspired in the killing of a young by the show this short in the series is like all the other films in the series practically without any story a group of guys have captured a young woman they tie her down and proceeds to her to death while her they beat her pour oil over her use on her and 
 i remember catching this movie on one of the showtime channels what stood out for me is that this movie takes place entirely in phoenix arizona i 'm from there so i spot the a a scientist because they wear yellow and golf who is pursued by the police it takes about half the police force to take him down and when they do eventually kill him there are no bullet his spirit lives on however when a woman finds 
 the from poland must be a for she finds young to be a great film and historically accurate nothing could be further from the truth as a practicing russian for many many years i took exception with at almost every turn and in particular the politically correct of her as the boss who moved russia into a direction of dominance the truth she was only brought to to be a wife and mother and found she had to bond with 
 this is one of the best movies i have ever seen it 's so full of details and every time you see it you 'll find new things like then the father is in the but still only one voice and when the they ca n't do it at the same time cause then there would be two and there are n't i have some problem finding out about in the middle of the movie their uncle visit them but 
 for an independent film it scores well with reasonably high production values and a great cast the acting is but the plot is compelling we could have used a bit more development of 's character but the guy 's fun to look at nonetheless mary place and are like on the 's not surprising that it was controversial on its release it presents a less than portrayal of the church and its relationship with while like mountain it 's about 
 let me start out by saying i 'm a big fan although i 'll admit i have n't seen all of his movies cough the cough bruce was none of the other reviews have really gone into how it gets the end i know what the writers were thinking somehow i could n't help but feel like this movie was a poor attempt at a positive note the daily show 's steve is and so is the rest of the 
 this is one of the first independent movies i 've ever seen for such a very low budget it was done well as an myself i can with the main character although my sleeping problems have never been as intense or as disturbing well directed well acted of a subject that i have n't seen much in theaters lighting and set both perfect for the movie setting there are few but they may be intended you 'll see after you 
 creative of film may neither have the most alternative nor the most artistic acting but who to say this film is no art i 'm not a of the idea that an important film must be serious or me with questions even there are a lot of films to this attributes that i for sure is not one of this films what you get is pure excessive creativity with a very positive charged energy this film does n't reflect reality

 where do i start lets list the good things about this movie is great as the thomas this is the only character you will actually care about and he 's a bad guy never does anything bad and is generally a pretty guy is always great he 's a bit down here but he is quite funny still the movie looked pretty good by swedish standards good use of of field and the bad this is by far the worst 
 this is a pretty version of the modern woman 's in this case she helps the man she become head of the company while serving as his secretary and eventually wins his love from a social her business sense is shown as parallel to her and the of the office are as the powers behind the lifted way above the average by mrs. 's performance 
 this one 's a many fans do n't rate this as high as the well-known classic episodes because it lacks the deep meaning or of those really great ones but this one is so well executed for what it is so successful as pure entertainment it always makes my personal list of the top half dozen episodes no matter what mood i 'm in several well known future movies and tv shows the more fantasy island took their from the 
 british tend to fall into one of two main types the quiet usually romantic study and the social characters and vary but certain place the vast majority of shows into one of the two categories is perhaps the of the first type the scripts are very including long interior by the main character a basically happy but unsettled about what she might have missed out on when she on a conventional life when she meets a successful but and accessible

 did the writers pay people to come up here and write positive reviews i mean really it 's a bit and is n't that funny he seems more like the serious guy trying too hard to be funny there are so many in this show like once the opening was talk show apply directly to the over and over and another that featured and another getting high and it was n't even funny they did n't even do anything but 
 i claim no matter how hard i seek i 'll never find a better movie version of if you love kenneth 's much about nothing N and N as much as i do i 'm dead certain you 'll also find oliver parker 's laurence has been in a various roles during his career he was quite in boys the N i 've always considered his amusing role of styles as his very greatest achievement that was of course way

 once a year comes a movie like that and makes things easy for you you do n't have make an effort to think it is good it 's just is you enjoy it while you watch it and you take it home with you i ca n't say it is totally but it 's near acting great story and with elements of it 's a small family story pretty much predictable but it 's not the secret itself that matters 
 i saw this movie with my mother and i loved it it was such a sweet story not to mention funny because of the supporting cast they never make movies like this ever my favorite part is when grace driver finds out about her 's wife 's death and that she has the wife 's heart and she what was god thinking i do believe everyone no matter who you believe in has thoughts like that once in but while 
 i 've always been a great fan of allen and always will be for most of what he did in the past but only a blind could ignore how and most of all acted this movie is a mental based on grounds and what a idea to artificially a presumed actor that is putting into will farrell 's mouth and gestures what allen would have done in farrell 's place had he been N years younger the outcome was obviously 
 the idea 's which are shown in this film are with a lot of care and detail and what a lot of people from around the world think of the american policies not the united states itself it shows what most of the people around the world think about america and what the americans know about themselves N directors showing N amazing minutes each of something which will give us viewers a lot to think about when they go home 
 's army formula instead of selling out for and big stars it relies completely on the excellent acting from a strong cast the strength of a well written script and a and bitter story the result is a raw and realistic film that moves along fast with a heavy emotional current one of the best i 've ever seen about the civil war and i think it can owe that to the pleasure of being an independent film if you 
 while not as bad as his this of does n't fare much seems to have a inability to accept that he does n't make good movies one of these days he 'll run out of money and stop the world with his acting was the sounded like they were reading and 's special little ' were seen throughout the whole all movies this one just should n't and like himself should n't exist > _ >

 the films use of and skin to create a feel to this movie unfortunately do not work in fact its quite as it the characters and reduces them to one least the original had an energy and the were quite stunning black is hardly nor is the main female at all in her attempts to and at the screen in her best camp is grossly and if you could imagine lunch ' directed by you may appreciate the attempt to 
 this would have to be one of the worst if not the worst movie i 've ever nearly seen i could n't watch it all the way through and simply it 's violence just for the of it and the ridiculous story line only adds to the and incompetent sick and only suitable for those with a love for manic after several hundred men women and children seed is finally caught after killing several more police officers that finally get

 today i looked this film because of the medium N N rating i thought it would worth also the comments here were quiet good but after start watching this movie i quick realize that this movie is n't anyway near a N N its just boring you can describe the movie with some words also its just the standard movie story with all the standard movie scenes i do n't know why people still like those films or why they 
 i really do n't get how people made this film and thought it was worth all the work they put into it even more are those who watched this film without feeling out of N minutes of doing something valuable like cleaning under the or reading first of all surely they could have N found real irish people and some women who could deliver their lines better than the up stars throughout this film granted the but it 's not

 this is a surprisingly great low budget it 's funny and pretty well made with good performances and a really cool twist ending all the characters are pretty cool and the story while is very good plus eric and justin had chemistry together one of the moments in the film for me is when is trapped in the and up to find that monster truck sitting there and decides to take a in the truck and brooks is just plain 
 john finished his remarkable career with one of the most perfect and sensitive movies i 've ever seen for his he decided to james 's beautiful short story the dead and made not only one of the most yet he also a movie that more than N years later still a lot of contemporary i watched this movie a few years ago as a student at university i in at the screen at every aspect of the movie acting screen 
 this movie should not be watched as it was meant to be a first wanted to make this a of classic movie but after having problems with the original makers decided to go ahead with the project and i guess leave all the good parts of the movie acting script music comedy action etc out and shoot the movie just because he already happen to hire the crew waste of money waste of time after making movies like and company 
 this movie came out about the same time as pretty woman while the general theme is the same wealthy man meets and to love a poor working class woman the characters of and are much more and worthy of our time with them i have never forgotten them and consider the movie superior to pretty woman in so many ways is a remarkable woman and the ways she helps her boss overcome his problems will make you the final scenes 
 national is about as and as they come nicholas is in no way a action hero and this film is no indiana jones people who have compared this movie to the indian jones classic have seriously fallen off their ca n't really figure out what kind of target audience this film was shooting for maybe the audience will like it but i found it to be absolutely i also ca n't imagine adults or young adults to find this to 
 what 's to like about this movie it is in it has some impressive photography it has a musical score in the background that works well at times so N out of N sometimes the music is up especially when the or the are about to move in sometimes it is slowed as if to convey to the audience it 's about to be time for as another one the dust as if in a western this has much similarity 
 this film has been to the point of the ridiculous american movie is a boring about a boring person so ordinary you 'll find equivalents on just about every corner in america it takes a long hard look at a guy who 's failed at just about everything in the interest of making an independent movie or two were his failures for other than his own or were they in the name of real art the movie might have had 
 i could n't agree more with N 's and i a 's comments a perfect laid back sunday morning movie the humor is exact opposite of as one noted what always to me is how often i find myself wanting to come back to this movie over and over i originally this movie onto about N years ago when it was on one of those pay cable free weekend hbo maybe had never heard of it previously do n't know 
 some films are designed to just you others to make you or cry or others like this aim to to make you think and to make you angry i was angry during this film not at the film but at the fact that it was true that america the free does in the view that it is doing it for the greater good the scenes in this movie were the of people was the film was compelling in its argument 
 i 'm at a loss this entire movie made absolutely no sense it was like watching a film for football the camera cutting the pace all so i thought the subject was too not serious for them to treat it like it was yes we all know like football and beauty must we be with it as an audience i watched because of lee and jay i was expecting young talent assembled in the style of dead 's society or 
 what a movie took me N times to finish it the thing i the most was the sense of humor jokes made by a N years old child not funny pretty actually for example when the get a place at the bar he she 's taking it all off and then they all run fast ' rush so stupid and also a guy sitting at the bar fruit to work out his post stress on the bar and the is 
 i liked the first movie but this is a example of a that would have been better of left on the drawing board the general idea in the first movie was if not great then at least very interesting this tries to build upon the idea and the characters from the first movie and though christopher is still good as the whole idea suddenly gets a bit ridiculous if you have n't seen any of these movies then get the 
 a very weird and did i say weird on at least on one level it did exactly what it was supposed to do it the gap between the silly manufactured hollywood look at pop that was the tv program and the adult growing and and yet still a little silly of the and most important line in the film is mike 's if they think we are plastic now wait till they see how we do it that the were 
 slow slow slow there is no mystery or excitement in this film if you do n't figure out who the is in the first ten minutes you must be brain dead the secret service must have been too because it took them the whole film to put it together there are no compelling characters in the movie not film the pace of the movie is slow there is no tension the hired killer is an excellent shot unless he is 
 the warning is for those people who want to see for themselves what animals and pass before their eyes although i do n't mention it in great detail earth is an N minute version based on planet earth which i watched all on tv version was by david a who i had had also done it for earth but it is patrick stewart star 's there are regularly shots of the earth from space so that 's may be appropriate 
 in my opinion this movie 's title should be changed from only the to all about lane i went to a of this film a few months ago and was quite disappointed with the outcome although i appreciate that the director made a movie about the men of a subject matter that long addressing in the film industry the acting in some parts of film was quite the performances of marc and scott lee were all great however the director 
 i thought it was not the best episode i 've every seen though my partner handed me a tissue in anticipation of the fraser moment sigh it was nice to see cox outside of the state he is in these days if only for brief moments i also enjoyed trying to place the episodes included by the length of the character 's hair or in case of and the of the earliest episodes i can also see how might be 
 i watched the whole movie waiting and waiting for something to actually happen maybe it 's my fault for expecting evil and instead of psychology is it a weird of the i want to kill my father and mother and my uncle and musical theater with him i did n't understand why certain plot elements were even present why was the construction why was there that big with a perfect spot for someone to fall to their if no one 
 an excellent example of what happens when one central body controls everyone i liked this movie because glenn also appeared in star as in i also liked it because i am a fan of the space program 
 that 's what me and my friends kept asking each other throughout this entire we could n't believe how stupid it was i think somebody shot this on their at home and it into the movie store and put it on the shelf as a joke to see if anybody would ever pick it up well i guess the joke is on guess i should have come to this first and read all of the reviews it has gotten every 
 writer mark as edgar allen tries to old and start a new life for himself as a baltimore maryland magazine publisher however and rejection threaten to thwart his efforts he would also like to with an old a significantly flawed prospect as things turns out mr. also directed this of the last days of edgar allen employs a lot of black and white color and photography to create mood kevin g. as dr. john well relatively speaking it 's not 
 rather nasty piece of business featuring as a mad scientist with yes a assistant and his mother a and yes the scientist 's wife sounds like a movie actually gives his wife from dead why them who knows so that his wife can keep looking beautiful he gets the after doing a pretty with some that makes the collapse at the after another the dust a newspaper reporter just happens to be around for the and decides to around for 
 my wife wanted to see this movie and i went along i have never been a big fan of the that is more exciting when it is n't structured in beyond that although i like ray charles ' music just fine i do n't consider myself a fan of him or his expected to either suffer or coast through this was is an engaging story told in a classic style the is in the the tilt of a character 's 
 i could n't stand to watch very much of this this is your standard junk that certain women old english era drama with lots of and characters that seem to be from either directly from oliver twist or some other novel this uses the usual from the era certain people really think that the whole emotional of that culture being so bloody is somehow and romantic this is pure and junk and boring as watching grow as such it is 
 contains the movie is a good but i do n't know if the director cut too many parts but it seems that the bad guy die too fast the end of the movie come the bad guy dies and that 's special effects are good and i do n't regret paying to see it at the theatre 
 tiny is the first i remember watching as a child and i loved every minute of it when i was four or five my parents purchased the video how i spent my vacation i watched it over and over again until i new every word well a few days ago my three year old came over and i had to him i decided to show him this old of my i new he would but i was surprised how much 
 there was some truth to this movie i remember a story reported N to N years ago of N finding a body in the water and they chose not to report it until their trip was finished i also recall they were charged with with a or some such charge i 'm not sure if it was in australia the viewers outside of australia must think we live in a country full of and serial wolf creek and this film 
 i never fail to be and by the evil that has been in the history of the world in the name of and it seems that the of the catholic church in century ireland rank right up there near the top considering that the wisdom of history and modern times should have had some love divided is the story of a real family by and all in the name of an church doctrine at the beginning of the film we 
 i absolutely hate this what kind of people sit and watch this garbage ok my and love it but i make sure i 'm well out of the room before it comes on its so and but the worst thing about it is the acting i stand all such as this because the are so wooden and what happened to with real mystery i mean who wants to know what happened to characters we know nothing about that died over 
 it 's hard to tell the actors from the bad american movies can be spotted by all the youngsters every single line of with you know what bad canadian movies can be spotted by all the youngsters ending every single line of with have we learned nothing in a century of can not the entire weight of millions of on hollywood with scripts and in hand rescue us from these horrible 
 i this has never happened to me before i only watched golden temple yesterday and already i have n't got the of anything that happened in this film that 's how brilliant this movie is i guess by now i only remember being into watching it because of the attractive cover art showing a drawing of a preparing her to fire at an unspecified target i often get by appealing covers especially franco ones and i still have n't learned 
 i went to see it N times this movie a friend of mine went to see it at the release party and he was telling me it was so great that i was expecting very much about the movie to i could n't enjoy it because i was not watching it in position the second time i knew what to expect and i enjoyed it more than the first time after the second time i felt so in the mood 
 i usually have a difficult time watching a tv movie the extra long commercial breaks will break my concentration and i give up and find a good book this one however made me put up with the adds and stay with it to the end i realize the movie was based on a true story but it was not brought out why it took so long to find they had his name and i would his social security number while 
 i mehta and this movie is a i 'd recommend to buy this movie on because it 's a movie you might want to watch more often than just once and trust me you 'd still find little meaningful details after watching it several characters except for the perhaps are all very balanced no black and white even though you follow the story from the perspective of the two there is also for the other think the rating for the 
 how to round up every possible and existing in the of and then subsequently stuff them into one movie the answer camp blood this is nonsense made on a and a little bit too obvious inspired by friday the four of the most characters you 'll ever see they 're like a combination of stupid and go and quickly find themselves pursued by a in a suit do n't even ask me what the killer 's were or even who 
 is a moving film that works on many levels at its it is the story of a street performer who bonds with a young child while trying to pass along his creative art to the next generation although at times the story makes the old man into a job it is so well written acted directed wonderful production values it is easy to move beyond his plight and if you hang with it the film is ultimately very sweet and 
 i understand that this movie is made for kids and as a parent i have sat through many movies that do n't particularly hold my interest but i can appreciate from a point of view in how it is being received by my children parents are supposed to be encouraged after all to take part in their children 's activities and to monitor the quality of the entertainment that they view so there should be something that appeals to an 
 the memory 's daughter in the form of a novel by kim edwards was a highly successful and probably was featured in more reading groups than any other novel during its circulation so what happened when the novel became a movie perhaps it is the below by john that consistently along in an fashion removing all sense of credibility to the story perhaps it is the cut and direction by jackson that misses the and character perhaps it from the 
 rock solid from a master of the from a by this mystery often develops until the which most might not see coming throughout the film it 's when everything has fallen into place that we can go the film around the death of a husband in an explosion and the million dollars the wife receives from it there are those with great interest in that money one in particular being the dead man 's the wife is and the demanding 
 i love b movies but i like to be aware from the beginning that i 'm watching one i ca n't believe someone could mess up a movie about aliens and so bad aliens and are this movie made a big joke out of them the did n't take this movie seriously at all i am disappointed in how the handled this film they made a of amazing characters it 's like they were trying to be serious in the 
 i went in to this thinking another gross movie with gross humor telling from my first sentence i do n't like that humor and this movie had it 's moments but i loved it justin long has really never done comedy like this where he 's and and i loved it lewis black enough said the ending i really did love because it had to take itself seriously i mean how else would you end it yes it 's another 
 i picked up this video after reading the text on the box the story seemed good and it had but after N minutes of watching i noticed how horrible his acting was he walks and talks so stupid the whole time it 's fake and not convincing it does n't end there almost all the characters act so badly it 's the only acceptable acting was by alan david but the guy early on and you do n't see him 
 may be no doubt one of the best if not the best in the i 've ever seen is an or just a crazy this is the question you 'll be asking yourself all throughout the movie kevin is simply amazing as is jeff bridges you ca n't beat this kind of acting plus some at times some of kevin actions in this movie are very funny when he was up in the tree for example and when he was 
 i saw this film in its premier week in i was N years old and at that time i found it adequate and somewhat fun i then came to discover the world of through the novels of the old pulp magazine stories i had no idea before any of this of the of but i fast became one of the most fans you could ever meet i read and still own all of the books i started going to comic 
 one of the worst movies i 've seen camera work usage film was script was terrible i mean come on how predictable was the big battle at the end some of the fight scenes were i guess some scenes were so bad it was like getting the horse and riding at the end i mean really a horse oh forget how the bad roll around in the same vehicle throughout the entire movie one would think that after key witness 
 less than two hundred and years ago the last of the great wrote their names in blood and fire across the pages of history this is the story of a whose name for one short year struck in the hearts of and merchants from the ports of the caribbean to the trading houses of london that opening to the film sounds like we are in for one hell of a of a movie does n't it well it 's not 
 in a time when hollywood is making money by showing our weaknesses crime drugs and war along comes this film which us the concept of the spirit if you are feeling beaten down this movie will free your mind and set you soaring we all know how tough life can be sometime we need to be reminded that and will get us through that 's what this film did for me and i hope it will for you 
 this film is one that played very well back in N and probably would n't work as well today because its style it a bit old and however if you are the sort person like me who older hollywood films you cut the film a bit of slack and can enjoy it for what it is an interesting film is set in a ward for problem in this large room are about a half dozen in which women are waiting 
 tony is a good actor who is trying his hand at a walk on the moon appears to have borrowed from other better made films the present story takes place in the late at a summer resort for working class not far from the screen treatment by gray does n't have much going for it so it 's a why mr. decided to tackle this film as his first attempt at family is spending some time at the resort we 
 watched N out of N leonard fair movie based on a novel by the author of dick fame this movie is about the of a ship who had stolen the eyes that were extremely rare black from a native tribe 's god and hidden them somewhere that only he knew about before leaving the island of he got very sick and was on a secret to go back to the island to retrieve the for himself while others like his 
 i gave this more than a N because i did think there were some moral in this story and it provoked some thought and comment from my wife and i. the acting and the dialogue were and i must i came out feeling like i had been beaten over the head with the god this god that and is our stuff the movie and the story line did not need it if as i am you are a recovering catholic 
 when i know that walter will never grace another was in my N 's when i first saw this sweet and romantic loved it from the first scene and all the way through to the was his usual matched walter step for step in the and richard benjamin supplied the voice of reason that he does so the way there were many actors whom we all recognize doing their usual there are a couple of lines in the movie which 
 a better film could have been made to the tragedy of some parts are very effective and the film does well to give some idea of the suffering of the people specially the children but overall it looks less like a film and more like a is very good but the rest of the cast has performed well without being extra ordinary should be watched in order to get a rough idea of what the war did to the children 
 i have not read the novel or anything other by kurt but i am now to start this you from the very first frame and does not let go until the end credits start rolling taking you places you do n't expect the plot is interesting throughout the is nothing lasts too long and this does a perfect job of between unexpected and allowing the to process what we 've seen it is and out i 've never watched a 
 murder in i have always considered one of the better books as it is very and has an ending there is no doubt that the tv is striking with some lovely photography and a very music score as always david is as the highlight of the episode being 's battle with a in the middle of the night and fraser is good as the rather hastings the remainder of the cast turn in decent performances but are careful not to 
 based on the idea from moon child took place in a country called in a the story followed the lives of the two main characters and and their friends growing up some actions might be overly done or perhaps i strongly believed that this is a movie about friendship even all the between each character in the end each of them wanted to have someone on their side to have most characters portrayed a that the idea of having to 
 i went to see this film last night at the national film theatre in london as a birthday treat it was the the first time i 've seen it and i think it has now the as the worst film i have ever seen for no reason and full of that from the and obvious to the and not particularly or shot i really do n't understand why this is considered classic or otherwise i normally enjoy films that push 
 i want to add to the for the production of this film especially the off of smooth and skin creates beautiful the film was for and won a single the first given for 's performance is moody and powerful 
 this is an excellent movie had no role model 's to base her actions on yet was able to bring about very necessary change to a land that was living in when it comes to female treatment i like the fact that it was a real story rather than made up it added to the of the story & the 
 if john waters had written and directed house of N after being struck about the head repeatedly with a heavy object the result would probably be something like the blood shed it 's mildly entertaining for the first half hour but then it into a sort of of constant and people doing things to each others with electric and susan is and terry west bullion is almost as bad in whatever it is he 's doing in front of the 
 this was a movie reasons cheap cheap special effects cheap stretching a N max movie into N little bit specifically for this movie are not funny they are and cheap though tried his best acting for which i him comedy was not funny at all i only N times during this movie first half of the movie was to the story of the half the half was the actual the first half was time up the characters are not developed 
 N saw the release of the two best of all time N judgment day and bill & ted 's out of the two i 've always liked bill & ted 's a bit better N judgment day is the better made but there 's just nothing like bill and ted besides chris and david in boy it 's hard to think of a greater duo than bill and ted they are one of a influenced by national 's and bill 
 i would of enjoyed this film but van just does the same old same old time after time fight scenes as per usually the only thing this loser left out was the russians normally end up being killed in the end this film is do do of the highest nature please please please van get some acting you need them anyone who likes van has issues it seems sad that the only way van ever gets any acting work is 
 i thought this was a great idea but boy was it poorly executed we do get a broad sense of how complex and challenging the operations of a show are but virtually no about any of it works the producers do n't seem to have found any way to tell a story or give the a which is not to say they did n't try but having the a of the ring cycle as the program 's does nothing to 
 this movie is called kane which it is n't the main character wears a hat but that 's all he has in common with robert howard 's character kane as known from early pulp magazines and lots of publications ever since these days it is a fantasy movie not really that bad and it might easily have passed with a rather good review if it had n't been called kane the hero is a newly invented character who definitely is 
 this movie is just tries to copy some effects borrowed to a creative director like in but it is too much the are pretty bad some of the worst i have ever heard is not convincing i have almost never found him very convincing his father in the movie plays very badly the story is the ending is think i have not dislike a movie so much since des of the wolf from and i watch see about movies a 
 the movie never becomes to watch and to tell it straight it has nothing to show either except maybe in a character in the story is very easy to follow or there 's nothing to follow you can see in either way there is no little action same boring locations and very acting kevin dillon is totally well i did n't concentrate too much on her acting i yet as i said earlier if one has nothing to do except 
 just saw this film the other day at the santa fe film festival i was by its honesty and humor it was the most thought movie i 've seen in a very long time i just ca n't get it off of my mind for some reason it may not be for everyone because it makes you think i do n't know if people like to think in movies so much anymore which is a shame the actors who play 
 many of us who went through high school probably made it through without having to take a physics course i know i did n't but after watching this program i surely wish i is a guide to the of physics ' the to all the fundamental forces of the universe into one equation ' that during the last years of his life brian green a professor at columbia university us to this mind theory in a simple way and leaves 
 every movie has made has become worse i 'd like to believe that most people would agree with that statement but seeing as has an from over N N ratings it does n't seem like the general public has any sense even his best work dogs was n't a ' the trouble is that claiming that you like 's work has become trendy as soon as that happens you get of people ready and willing to on another they will 
 for a movie shot in N days and a budget less than N million this little movie that could deserves a we could ' award interesting aside from the usual stuff with solid by a cast of familiar faces N up advice to the other do n't be afraid to say you liked something 
 ok let 's start with saying that when a dutch movie is bad it 's really bad rarely something with a little bit of quality comes along here in but not often costa is about N going to spain to go on vacation party get drunk get laid u know the drill it 's also about the world of or pro 's who 're trying to lure the crowd into their 'm not sure how long it took to write 
 the movie is good and i think is very beautiful i liked the movie can anyone tell me how i can get hold of the from this movie even the will do if that 's not possible can i at least get the names of the with their respective i tried to look up but its not there i tried cd baby not there either i through to get some details but there were n't any i would appreciate it 
 when the family is near rock australia sees her baby being dragged out of their by a and then begins an that no one should have to experience for it seems like the story is not believed by the public or the press and the whole thing turns into a circus does n't help matters either because she wo n't play to the jury or courtroom she 's only herself and she 's a tough to crack so of course 
 the performances of who appears funny somehow and short featured ed harris are remarkable unlike 's who does n't appear to find sense in his role and ends up in the of a old man in fact the does n't make sense imagine a N happy plus a sudden turn without any structure in respect to the characters it 's more an accident than a and may be good for examination purposes at ' schools the more you the details 
 sure the concept had already been done with and the thrust modern society onto one or more characters but i loved both shows and watched them until they ended in when i learned about i was actually very hopeful for something new as new tv in the N 's so far had n't impressed me but at least star and the were still going i got was a big disappointment the acting was awful but considering the ridiculous dialogue and 
 there 's a lot of directed at this movie and a lot of it is but it 's not the worst movie of all time that 's probably anyway if you 're high on something really drunk or just in the mood for a minus movie that you can make fun of this may be your cup of as others said the first part of the movie makes you think you 're watching an of the novel two of the 
 this is just a terrible ' it really is a bad film there are no funny elements no jokes that are funny i do n't know how some people can claim this dismal short film could be ' or ' perhaps if its the only film that a person has seen you can make that claim of the brothers but i have seen thousands of better films namely leonard part six now that 's funny i do n't know how 
 at the end of heat all i could think of was why i bothered sitting through the whole film 's is interesting and that as well as is what attracted me to the film in the first place but was i ever disappointed daniel lee ca n't hold a to the likes of john woo and has to be one of the most films i have ever seen lee is so up in his style and i use that phrase 
 you see a movie titled ' what are you going to think space with cool as explosions and everyone shooting at each other what do you get with this movie well you do get some space battle but for a great majority of the time it 's just stupid people around doing almost nothing no one talks what is this nonsense we get a and a ton of british computers but about it the main must be the worst one

 a good film considering the circumstances of its production features performances from actors that rival the top talent on the planet none have a career also features the the ability of christopher to write perfect dialogue dialogue is what carries this story which is about a man who likes to follow people for material for his books well shot very well even better written and well movie has everything a great film needs except people who have seen it

 this movie is a desperate attempt to ride the of the success of the star wars movies the film uses recycled from battle beyond the which is another roger but this one is better than battle beyond the stars there is no real acting in this film but its a roger did you expect again the entire was done on a the sound effects are recycled from there are no special effects because they were space scenes from another movie

 this film was nothing more than it was not an art movie just an excuse to show several scenes with extensive male there was a room scene involving over a dozen naked men the camera in on the men 's and as they are portrayed for several minutes with their in full screen view there are several scenes in this film showing after it gets real fast and makes it impossible to take this film seriously i was wondering if 
 the explosion of tv channels must be to the scott western production line because any any moment there must be one of what seems like a hundred scott movies playing on at least one station man behind the gun is a typical early N 's period with production values that relies on a murder mystery plot with action scenes to the script 's complete absence of character development and thus lack of in years to come the role of these

 this movie is great best acting i have ever seen in my life e is the best actor and of course and great music and sound cold hard reality about a struggle of a man that has a lot of problems and the people in his life black humor mixed with great acting and this european art movies style it works it comes together in a the best movie ever made i say to you see this film you will 
 films are a thing sometimes they manage to across a formula that works very well sometimes they try to tell a worthy story despite time and budget problems sometimes they 're so bad they 're actually fun and sometimes they 're the good film should contain that keep you they should allow you to be interested in the characters and their so that you actually have some sort of reaction when they die however the chooses instead to introduce elements 
 this will be brief let me first state that i 'm and not exactly crazy about especially however this had a tone of the like of some angry at his mother for not letting him play video games i just could n't take it seriously how thought he was to illustrate the point that can breed evil i do n't know it was just cheap and made the opposition look furthermore the just seemed and the delivery was complete i

 this film appears to be an of the current trend and in the wine industry around the world are more and more either joining large the american producer in the case of this film or paying high-priced experts to help them make the perfect wine and as a result wines are becoming very standard and predictable to some this is a good thing especially since few can afford to pay $ N or more for an everyday wine and to 
 it seems incredible that the same decade which brought star wars to the screen such as this and many other ' movies i am reminded of the similarly but equally ' outlined motivated actors to for such of is frankly beyond this writer they must have been very very desperate to be perfectly roger moore 's appearance in any movie is the of death although extremely in his youth his entire acting career has been upon an ability to raise 
 it was obvious that this movie is designed to appeal to the audience to which i have sat through quite a few and enjoyed most however this was a very attempt by graham to become the next who became as hell in her own right her acting was and it appeared that she was compared to her colleagues who were in their roles this film might have been more as there was suitable budget for actors and a decent story 
 i can admit that the is n't very good and that it has some slow parts but all of you critics of this movie need to learn how to have some fun first of all the performances are great michael douglas kim and michael douglas proves he has still got it and kim plays a very interesting character as the cheating wife and play the dynamic duo both adding their incredible talent to the pot and second of all this

 this is a strong movie from a historical and perspective while the story is simple it is pure and in truth it is the standard story of a simple man whose honor comes into conflict with the more educated and men of the vs. rich vs. a classic but tale without much of the of hollywood up the points just because you can almost the people on the screen

 i actually enjoyed if not for much more than the production values dennis was just fine although i wonder if he would have signed on the project had he seen the special effects they used and furthermore what was with the scene with the that was just completely out of pace perhaps someone came up with the bright idea oh well this movie is great if you 're drunk and need a good 
 i 'm almost embarrassed to admit to seeing twice the problems with the production are almost too numerous to mention the script is it 's easy to see why tried to it the direction is worse most of the movie consists of long shots cut with with cross cuts of mostly more obviously in the version the is especially par giving the whole production a cheap look that some of the elaborate set designs the movie should 've looked a

 this movie has been advertised for over three months in greece as the biggest production ever well it could be but when you hear of a big production you expect to see something new something different what you get to watch here is a movie with no reason of existence george looks like he did n't really enjoy making this movie his acting is so that looks almost the sound especially when some of the actors speak english dubbed is 
 i just saw this film tonight and i have to say that it 's a mess i love but he ends up more that funny here and the film is more than less a of the N 's classic santa the movie but with out the camp or the bad song at the end story is your run of the mill black sheep in the family who comes back to face his family for the holidays kind of thing but 
 for a comedy this has a decent and plot and parker and stone 's comic timing is perfect there are dozens of funny moments to this movie i especially like the of colors and the way the clash in the sports arena scenes robert is also very amusing 
 there are few films that leave me with the feeling that jordan 's kelly ' film did initially i had heard only half recommendations and decided to see it for myself since then i have acquired both the video and and have to say that after several i am still very impressed with the underlying character of this film it is also wonderful to see something australian i appreciate its down to earth quality that if you ask me is 
 this is the first N out of N that i 've given any movie what made this movie so good for me constant action there is n't any slow parts great acting smart writing i also liked the style where the and different just made it feel like you are a part of the scene finally i get to see an action movie that does n't try to please all sectors of the public there 's no forced liked the 
 i sort of ended up watching this movie i 'm still not sure if i regret it or not i felt like i was watching the film made by that group of film school students that did n't quite make the cut it plays up every hollywood all the while us with the are the ultimate evil ' message this movie does not know as far as that goes it even manages to provide it 's own story appears to 
 baby is always most likely because it has a rating instead of the usual r rating that a movie gets all that the means is that does n't take her top off she takes her top off in every other movie she 's been in though so it is more exciting than more action it takes off slow but by the time she 's on screen the have started like martin is the heavy trying to get 's father but

 edward is a canadian who makes art out of the least everyday items such as boxes metal containers etc items which most of us as at best and dismiss as being utterly without merit are instead converted into by 's camera he this result by focusing on the colors and patterns that are apparently ever present in the industrialized world for those enough to spot them that is even of trash can become of beauty when seen through 's lens 
 i loved so much about this movie the time taken to develop the characters the attention to detail the performances the stunning lighting and the wonderful it has a combined intensity and of touch that wo n't work for anyone who wants the typical action if we lived in days i 'd say this movie 's a bit like a tragedy but since we do n't let 's say it 's more like a plot is simple but the story 
 first let me state that i am a big fan of that 's why i was to check out this her debut role no argument that her talent is apparent and her performance excellent i guess i can also see how the professional critics liked the content of the story however i like to think that movies are meant to us and that is where this movie the point i found myself thinking how much longer do we have to

 i would like to comment on the movie april love it 's one of my all time because my father nelson plays the horse i remember when hollywood came to lexington where we were living at the time to make april love my had been in numerous plays and was a man i talked him into going to try out for one of the bit parts offered and and he came home script how exciting is that also a number 
 although this film is somewhat filled with i have a place for it in my and i do n't know why i think i like it because the moral of the story is is garbage so turn it off and go and get a life ' for those of you who do decide to the message then you should try reading the book its nothing like the film at all to it for you at the end of the story 
 as everyone knows is the man in this film he a real artist who fought over N bulls with his hands and won interesting guy look him up anyway only one bull in the film but it 's a scene and as the notes say right up there with the vs. scene in the film also offers up of combat and a decent plot to though i do n't believe all of it is true this film is the first

 a lot of the comments seem to treat this film as a baseball movie but i feel this is only secondary it 's really about living in japan and it really spent a few years living in japan and i the reason that this movie did n't do too well is that you sort of have to have experienced japan to get it i was watching this with a friend who 's never been to japan and he noted that

 an interesting that has paul as a on the case of a murder paul was an actor who pulled off all his roles with such ease it was hard to tell the man was even acting maybe most known by younger viewers as the of city confidential ends his career with a movie but as always a treat to is well nice to look at but leaves a lot to be in the acting department though to be fair this 
 is a film about well and his army of killer women led by queen he fights to get his club the total experience back from green by their and their to him i liked this movie because of the dialogue and also the use of ray moore 's ability to to his brothers in 
 i saw this movie for a number of reasons the main being with her on the cast it could n't be so bad and it even seemed like it had some mystery and was her at the time and he was pretty good in ' the story is set in spain so it could be an exotic entertaining movie with one of my favorite you 're thinking about the same thing let me warn you this is a truly awful 
 so i got a hold of this as an for harris who teaches occasionally in the film at the u of i guess this is his only real way to get anyone to see his film the section at the beginning dragged on yes the kid is a from no where but that 's not good enough to keep it penn dressed as a is the only highlight and after about seconds it loses all takes on larry the was

 as an person i on the surface took my younger brother to see this film although i hoped it might be east is east ii the looked fun so i thought i 'd give it a took about ten minutes but after that i was to the screen and that was n't anything to do with the neck caused by sitting too near the front due to a packed the acting was fresh and the characters engaging and the jokes 
 read my which probably has different in its french title is a contemporary tale of office politics that unexpectedly becomes a crime as the unusually matched characters slide up and down an ethical and two leads are magnetic who i 've never seen before despite her lengthy resume in french movies and an even more than usual vincent who has brought a threatening look and voice to some us movies first half of the movie is on her turf in 
 i do n't know where most of you were at but where i watched the film we did n't have people as some have told they experienced we had people laughing mostly at the plot line the horrible dance and the of the likes of the only people in the audience who seemed to be with the film were the generation folks who were some how the past with the i was a in the and even went to the 
 this was a movie with a cast danny tony joseph and especially christopher are in this movie about angels helping the angels baseball team you never know it could happen i loved lloyd 's role in it he was the story is about turning your life around as the kid 's belief in angels helped turn around angry and manager see the best in people the movie was well made and also about seeing the best in people and reaching 
 at first i watched this movie because of the sex scenes i heard it but by actually watching the film it just made me realize that there are still good and movies out there truly it is one of the most and movies i 've ever watched i 'm a and the film spoke to me about my sex love acceptance etc it gave me an idea on how to deal with these issues with the help of my and 
 this bizarre of short story is typical cox his strong sense is as usual by the half acting of most of the cast the film is definitely in the tradition of 's mexican period and looks at times like a poor man 's take on von 's elements of crime cox 's apparent preference for single takes jump cuts and sound recording all work against the film 's effectiveness worth a look but ultimately disappointing 
 this is just one more example of the of gene wilder he wrote and in this mystery no one could have done it better the was throughout i wish mr. wilder would grace us with another of these i have enjoyed everything i have ever seen mr. wilder in but i had no idea how truly he was until i saw murder in a small town and this he truly has a firm grasp on what audiences want and how 
 just got my copy of this two set and while not perfect i found the overall experience to be a fun way to waste some time i have to say right up front that i am a huge fan of movies and i truly think that the fine people who made these films must be too i also have a soft spot for people who are trying sometimes against all odds to live a dream and again these people are 
 at what point exactly does a good movie go bad when does a movie go from to where 's that & # off switch for like this one that can be borrowed from the library for free likewise for the fast forward switch on the player i feel sorry for those people who were at the box one point i 've forgotten exactly when because now it 's all just a our hero wilson starts running through traffic i think 
 notable because of it 's notorious explicit scene when the takes her young 's from his and into her mouth even without this moment the film is a if slightly disturbing and ride puts in a great performance as the partly about her flat dressed partly dressed and naked she most of the film about love sexual passion philosophy and politics for me the last two get a little lost and the ending is most confusing when her is released 
 this solid little film is actually one of 's best the story is pretty routine stuff but the atmosphere is what really makes it come alive in fact the ghost story is almost an the real comes from the prison setting itself and h. no detail in showing us how bad the conditions are inside that crumbling old with a too is excellent as usual in the lead role supported by some very there are no pretty boys in this 
 i first saw death in venice N about N years ago found it moving and often thought about it watching it again few days ago i realized that it is close to the top of the great works of with hardly any it a with the beautiful the fine acting and above all the 's music without which the movie simply could not exist death in venice is a stunning 's of the thomas about a famous in the he 
 this is a kind of thing meaning you either like the or you do n't if you do you 'll love this personally i prefer the and most of the with the of and rogers and bill robinson james temple and so forth but the of the the slower dance numbers and the of the decade all turn me film is a the first song was but the next three did nothing for me by then the story did n't 
 i was n't sure where this was headed until the ending when it turned out that this was all a liberal conspiracy to hand the world over to european and the united nations what a load of the bit about canada joining the us did n't really have much to do with the plot at all and the idea was never developed the only point of it seems to be that it made the main character eligible to run for 
 the movie was very moving it was tender and funny at the same time the was absolutely beautiful peter and paul gave award winning performances olympia was great i understand due to the story line her part had to be brief but i did wish i could have seen more of is a true will be able to recall from your own life hopefully in a positive way after seeing this movie we were to see paul at a and 
 i see people writing about how great this movie was it was horrible the acting was at best it made a lot of money because went to see the movie N times in the theaters because of where the hell did they get the money anyway i wanted to learn more about the why it sank what was running through a lot of people 's minds maybe even a little conspiracy stuff does anyone realize that certain people did n't 
 this movie is so bad there are not words to describe it if i got a video camera of a for an hour and a half it would be a of a lot more entertaining than this the plot is so and it is not even worth the best part of the movie was when the credits and i got a out of knowing the lead actors name was james bond iii just trust me and stay far away from 
 pulp in the woman audio the and it 's for a movie about people who do n't speak english there 's no to be found here it 's a with and one wild animal attack that happens in the african and of these wild women have advanced out of the stone age only so far as to makeup shoes and hair removal technology despite their for the insist that they will fight the men and the weaker only thing of 
 i 've got to say that i 'm not a massive fan of films granted i 've only seen three of them or four including this one but two blood and mothers ' day are widely to be the best which leads me to believe that all the others are n't worth seeing that would certainly seem to be the case with day which is a take on the while the film is never particularly bad given the type of 
 personally i think that the film was done very i loved the and the acting the plot is also and the film itself is very emotional and what i liked about it most is that it makes you think antonio has absolutely lived his role to the end and i must say that it 's one of my pictures and is a wonderful director 
 this is by far one of the most boring and acted accounts of the early days of that i have ever watched robert is a wonderful actor but to cast him as is just plain wrong to cast as 's longtime friend and aid must have of and from the simon a playing a bad bad bad casting this was not an family film with a good historical background this was hollywood at its in on the strength of a 
 is an important film to our history this second appearance of mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous film mostly because it was so this is because it was the first sound while you do n't yet hear speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film something we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd in if this were just an important historical film it would 
 i did n't get the thing the first time i watched this episode it seemed like something significant was going on that i could n't put my finger on this time those costa mesa fires on tv really caught my and it helped that i was just writing an on but let me see what has n't been discussed yet a review mentioned that tony had N flights of to go down because of the broken N is a significant 
 i got hold of this film on with the title evil never it gives front cover billing to ann moss but she plays such a minor character that i did n't really notice her in the 'm afraid that i consider this one of the worst purchases i have ever made the dialogue was and the delivery wooden i found the acting to be from the plot graham 's performance to me was of someone who 's wondering whether she 
 this is a case of a bunch of people thinking they are so they have a story that fits the time remember the political caught on camera in the years leading to the and a little later most movies trying to cash in on ' so powerful so mind ' were in fact caught in their own was never a fan of the conversation which i find as much dated as others conspiracy of the time but was true to

 this is one of those movies you see in the video store that you just have to get because it just looks so bad and indeed we could n't take most of it there was a lot of going then we came across a scene where robert the female her name somehow my mind at this time i 've never watched a single scene from a film so many times i 'm estimating or so and i 've never so 
 i first saw the victim out of well over N years ago when i was very young being a fan of since i was a child i loved to watch anything that elizabeth montgomery this movie was and still is a real treat whether you are a fan of miss montgomery 's work or not elizabeth always in her roles such as her portrayal as the rape victim in a case of rape and as the suspected in the of 
 david master of plays the big boss ivan who upon the unfortunate richard jordan by forcing the to exploit his new position in a bank miss most effectively provides the female interest whom can not simply can not seems they were unable to decide on one name for this film so instead they used four makes sense this turn out to be one of 's last this film is fun and well worth watching if you manage to catch one 
 there seems to be little in the way of middle ground where watch on the is concerned one either likes it very much its its liberal point of view and fine acting or else its obvious propaganda dialogue characters and overall i fall very much in the latter category and found the film and play concerning the activities of european refugees in washington during a mostly for the acting and even then only that author was on the side of 
 this final installment of the airport franchise was so awful that it took me to realize it actually was n't a comedy like george kennedy shooting a gun out an open window to missiles was what would happen to your hand if you held it out a window at two speed you 'd lose your grip on the gun and get a broken arm the passengers were as was the interior of the plane the sophisticated french woman coming on 
 so if a guy meets you and he says ' i want you to look at my ' do n't be alarmed maybe he wants you to look at the film he made about how his house was to be built yes that 's the only thing what happens in this movie it 's like the worst i ever saw it 's like the inside of your toilet before you flush it in fact it 's less interesting to look 
 for fans this movie is just what you 've been waiting for watching this movie gets you lost into the characters especially the movies bad guy this is the case where you root for the bad guy and want to see him live and win as you watch the struggle to stay alive you long to see who lives and how they survive these unknown creatures that have taken over this planet an excellent movie diesel did a wonderful job 
 two kinds of movies we like are N and N movies from N or N years ago we ought to have liked a man called but but this picture is and stupid from start to finish since there is nobody in the story good or bad to warm up to there is nobody to the necessary to keep the interested no among the guys trying to steal the gold and no among those trying to protect it has a pretty 
 if you 've ever wanted to see a film that style over substance this is for you to me son de is beautiful to see but there 's precious little substance unless love turn you on this may be one of those famous ' you 've heard so much about we 're about through this film before anything really happens goes out to sea looking for and does n't come back leaving his wife and son to fend for themselves 
 sometimes a starts out good but because of the demands of having to go to meet the demands of an audience suffering from it into an mess and for three actors who have made better work before and after this is a let 's see a couple who lives in a beautiful home is threatened by a bad interesting to say the least make the a little disturbing why not it was well done in the hand who rocks the

 its such a shame that an important film like this is virtually do n't think alan bates has done a better film than never shown on television the only time i can recall it being shown on british tv was in the summer of i have it on tape but the quality is n't great due to a at the time i remember wanting to see this film for some time before it appeared on tv it was shown on 
 this movie is a terrible attempt at a its attempts to various sports movies are and not at all things that should be funny like the female from india who 's always wearing traditional dress over her uniform are n't really funny the fact that the football team studies and gets good grades which makes the coach mad did n't get any plot of having a traditional loser get one more chance by a loser high school football team really 
 this is a film that left me wanting to learn more of the afghan history and with evil reality it was to experience the beauty of the people and their was the simply the acting was first rate and the fact that the academy this except it 's music is script is wonderful and such and emotional an cry from this film worth watching a second and third time

 my movie of all time this was a flawed piece of work by and seeing the of ' made it even more compelling at this point was king of hollywood after making ' and ' and had developed the necessary to even try to make a movie like now ' through sheer he went to the with a partial script and thought he would know what he would do when he got there just as thought he would know what 
 i really wanted to like this film and i do n't think i was disappointed being an american history teacher i felt an obligation almost to see this film and as far as the history went it was n't bad sure there were a few mistakes here and there especially with the the movie only appeared to last a few months or perhaps a year not over six years of actual fighting but the overall spirit of the film and 
 brown 's attempt at a with gut humor and truly original and that rival 's own and sets are top and chris elliott offer their own of comedy that and this film appearances by and as themselves is an added 's hard to tell if brown 's performance is meant to or though i hardly think the material girl would find humor in favorite line why do n't you come here to the all they eat is dog and i 
 highly flawed but just about comedy ' that runs like a brothers reject the most criminal thing about it though is the casting i could n't for one minute believe jerry and in the role of who could pull any woman at the drop of a hat nor could i believe the very beautiful shannon elizabeth as a tough story is predictable but does manage to raise a on a few occasions although the gross out ' meant to be 
 i have seen this film probably a dozen times since it was originally released anyone who calls this movie trash or horrible just does n't understand action films or recognize a good one perhaps to some the incidents and may seem far but in my opinion black bang bang one of the most well thought out action you will ever come across over the top or not this film flows like and the action just keeps coming the final action 
 i never comment on a film but i have to say that this was one of the worst films that i have ever seen i feel it was made by a film student and not to put down film students but this was horrible i did not buy the lead actress and felt i was in acting class with her while she was on film her decisions were very safe and i feel she was other in films and not

 i was the production on this movie and i also got to do some work on it so i 'm not entirely but if it were awful i would say so i thought it was a fun film not a by any means but there were plenty of along the way the states that does good like a medicine so watching this movie could be good for your many of the actors in this picture had n't yet reached their 
 i it depends on when one actually sees the movie for the first time that their impression is formed the way it saw it as a child on tv back in N when it was the and i loved it such was the time when the space program to the moon was a reality when shows like search ufo and $ man were showing a child of N of what the world could hold in their future and got to 
 lives is a very bad movie in my world history class our teacher had us watch this movie and to be able to compare the two or something we watched first and it was a very good movie but when she had us watch this movie directly after that i could n't believe what i was seeing the acting was the were the little boy 's was especially and and the was my friend compared it to a home movie 
 when i decided to try watching a movie about i was n't expecting a whole lot that 's exactly what i got and then even less aside from a shortage of special effects and a severe lack of any acting talent the also sports the worst script i 've ever seen made into a movie i had to stop the tape numerous times during the first N minutes in order to repair the damage done to my for such dialogue 
 i really wanted to be able to give this film a i 've long thought it was my favorite of the four modern batman films to date and maybe it still will be i have yet to watch the films again i 'm also starting to become concerned about whether i 'm somehow being you see i always liked the films as far as i can remember they were either or to me but the conventional wisdom is that the 
 we have an average family 's a famous we have the daughter the adopted white kid and the little kid and we have what show has had a like that do we have a brady bunch when it first came out i thought it was really cool mostly because i was young the music was bad the were so bad and they were too all of his were about his family and friends and problems the was kind of the 
 sir john must have become to star in a mess of a movie like this one this is one of those films i that is considered art but do n't be it 's garbage stick to the art you can in a frame because the films that are labeled as such are usually like this shakespeare 's the while the camera away to people one of them a little kid in a pool this is stuff and real art ai 
 apparently i am against the tide of the comments on this film i have not seen it since i was N or N years old but there is one thing i remember the was nightmare with the music and the little girl and away for their lives as a kid i also remember the no worries down did n't an eye and the it still haunts my dreams and i have several friends the same age who also think it 
 some bad reviews here for this and i understand why but treat it as a low budget serial killer film and you might get more from it than thought that this worked in a way because i felt and wanted to take a long so that is some degree of success is n't it i would say there is just the right level of here to get under your skin although the acting is maybe a bit too david hess 
 the core issues at play god & good & evil can be & should be compelling as demonstrated through thousands of works of end of days unfortunately is nothing but a 's acting ability stands so obviously in sharp contrast to arnold 's corresponding lack of ability and is further by a plot filled with nothing but single compelling scene occurs at the very beginning with the of the character and his subsequent with his wife girlfriend it is both 
 i have to say this is one of the best movie i have seen so far for the action was a lot better then the first movie because it had a lot more fight scene and it came to u at a faster pace it was amazing the was excellent as well as most of the story line is something new to but it is basically the same as the first movie in the series u see them fight against 
 i 'm that we all no matter if we are fans of cars the sound of a dodge as it along the road the noise a N chevy make as it with when it round a corner and most of all the blast of sound as a classic vehicle bursts into as it i 'm not the biggest car by any stretch of the but any of the above really does my engine there 's no denying the importance of 
 i do n't think this movie had the effect on me that was intended seeing american soldiers shooting soldiers from the other side and in their to them into making them talk made me root for the other side it certainly made the us forces look anything like the good guys was this supposed to be acceptable 
 yes sure this is a friday the off but i have no problem with it it 's a good effort the killings are n't that but the acting of one girl carries the movie what a queen for a low budget movie the effects are done sometimes you can guess how it is done some people have problems with the use of the camera i ca n't see what 's wrong with that it 's so strange that so many 
 up until the last few minutes of the movie i would have given the movie a score of N or N stars however the ending is so terrible and that it completely the first N of the plot around a and the possibility that they received an order to fire their nuclear missiles the gene is all for launching while his first officer washington is in favor of confirming the launch orders first the problem is to launch both the 
 the acting is the out of the way is and all the characters are middle class and men are as sexual aiming to use children in their empty film could only appeal to people who know and would get minor satisfaction from pointing out any is no time to engage with the characters and has a result you really don care about them at the of her fame stars as a woman seeking a from her husband and on screen 
 like the above i got burned on the title thinking i was getting the other this movie is everything the above said and worse poor camera acting and just plain there was very little here that was even worth watching how this movie even got released is beyond me make sure the movie you buy is the one you want and not this movie i bought was labeled and not which is what it actually is this is the only 
 for once a movie that is good i 'm N and a embarrassed to say this but i 'm on these movies i when i was younger but the movies i love is so and i 've fallen in love with him he 's so as the bear and totally in love with oh man i 'm in love with i love determination not to give up on hope and it works i love this movie and hopefully they will 
 i was pleased to see that she had black hair i 've been a fan for about N years now and have been at the two earlier attempts to film the was pleased that the the period to include a computer it did n't it at all in fact i watched the film twice in one day a sure sign that it was up to standard this is what i do with books that i like as thought all the 
 there are four great movie the vietnam war they are in no particular order now born on the fourth of july and finally all but focus on the actual war and the men in it focuses on men in advanced training for the vietnam war the character of is one of the most important of a man questioning war and the of it this has been done in many war movies but rarely in camp also this is a very 
 this movie is absolutely horrible i thought because it had good actors in it like union hill harper and of course the d. williams the movie is long and on with a style of showing union who has died in the movie talking about her family which by the way is a confusing family because you never know who 's who and who 's related to who i would not recommend this movie to anyone and i wish i could 
 is not for all in fact maybe in for nobody except lynch and that 's what make it funny and a collective violent yes yes absurd yes a piece of garbage never is a wonderful picture of some americans that do n't have brains and hit wife and kids for fun from i can say i love it my favorite episodes are my are bleeding all the noise around and violence make me and put me behind my bed get 
 review in english since swedish is not allowed i saw this movie with extremely low expectations and i can inform you that the movie barely lived up to much as i loved to see on the big screen again the writers should have realized early in the process that seven people falling into the water is n't original or funny the story is very thin and the jokes are used and predictable the ones that ai n't is just plain 
 in times a father is from his family when he is accused of and they are sent to live in the country the children to their new situation make friends and the help of a kind old man they wave to on the train to help their who direct movies are often not very good at it however the great veteran actor of dozens of british comedy is one of the few exceptions his brilliant conception he also wrote the 
 when this film gets it right it really gets it right and when it goes wrong i 'd say that a full of the film is great i can even the bad bit it 's everything that has to do with the everything that you need to know about it is said in the first five minutes but it on for about i 'd recommend that section if you can it does nothing except explain his it should have been 
 what this film has is its you really do get the feeling james has been doing his on the subject of skiing while director michael the movie in a fly on the wall style however the problem is unless you a big fan of the sport there s not a lot in to grab your attention anyone asks why i watched it i did so because it featured the great gene in an early role but that s not really 
 like the first touch of pleasure and like a of and fear like a of contrary said one of the movie after love at the top the title version of director 's vincent in new york times however just after the N premiere of the movie stated love at the top which opened yesterday at the street is a N french comedy that recalls a number of english about the rise and rise of young men yet the significant difference 
 this is a weird and compelling film the topic about the created at los in the usa and used on japan during the latter part of world war ii is huge and of course deeply disturbing the film 's plot takes on a lot of heavy issues and the actors have to carry much of the creative tension i had never seen the film or was much interested in it i have to admit until i read the book smoking 
 although i am not a michael jackson fan i like some of his early and some from jackson N too ' is one of his great and it comes from the ever with the same title as for the video it is one of michael 's best but also very and is a story behind this video but it 's so complex that even i ca n't fully understand it it 's the things are jackson 's into a his 
 follows the lives of a group of recently drafted men into the army who are called up to fight in vietnam in this point america knows they are fighting a battle and the director takes us through a shot film of the lives of several in the ' training camp in film is more of a character study no real plot but it focuses on a key character who is a yet man who only wants to escape the camp 
 to all the on this page i would have to say this movie is worth seeing so it was made in N so what the fashion in the movie was exactly the same fashion of its time people who did n't study culture of the decades would think that this movie is a ball compared to the modern series left behind ' which is made for our time right now it does look however the only part of the movie 
 i really should give this more credit that N star because the film has so many lines that it 's almost worth the price of the rental the acting if you want to call it that is so and that it makes ed wood 's actors appear life like the lone black character must be 's husband in real life because he appears in her other films but he has zero acting ability his lines are due to his absurd 
 another one for the & bullets crowd the story is much than any other musical i have seen hidden up the missing of and places each in the other in a way that comes closer to comment than we might expect for the more effective than contemporary ' it is hard identify with a woman who keeps a up her in of pretty remarkable if you consider the the up the leg thing providing N of the surprises this film 
 i am a big fan of arnold finally seeing him as the star of a recent movie not just a bit part made me i took film appreciation in college and the only thing i can say that i did n't like was that the film was made in an abandoned part of town and there was no background traffic or have to say that the acting leaves something to be but arnold is an excellent actor i have to 
 this begins with an interesting it makes an intriguing and convincing argument that the history of as is commonly believed is probably a though after us with this the movie completely shifts and becomes little more than a attack on and pretty much focusing on the easy clearly has some issues with the church he is a former christian and has some anger and this film seems to be his form of release it 'd be interesting to see the 
 the great were made between N and this year can be the golden era of the there were prior to that and there have been but the true seem invariably to have been made during that period in the rain an american in paris the band seven for seven brothers oklahoma south pacific the king and i and many more stand tall as much products of the age perhaps the last great musical of the golden era is carol reed 
 they say david took six days to write the script for this movie that sounds about movie is one of the worst films i 've ever seen and i 've seen it 's not as bad as but that 's like saying was n't as bad as has been living in france with his french wife and old son he has been to be french all this time he reveals to his wife that he is actually american for some 
 i can admit as an that lady ' will never crack into my film top it may not even into the top but rather than the film for not being as good as so many other of the film it should be noted that lady ' has enough strong and lasting images in it to make it a all that is required from the is the ability to get beyond the slow film does n't get cooking until ' sets 
 i can not quite understand why any of the gave this N other than for political reasons no the film did not investigate both sides of the story but then surely one film in of against the of propaganda against him should be seen as an attempt to balance out the overall especially given a. the history of cia involvement in latin america in civil unrest national security and b. the coverage in that country and elsewhere of the clearly 
 i just got back from the film festival at the in a friend told me about this film audience response was very positive lots of good solid as well as some quiet moments of top in every area a movie that makes you think and then makes you realize how lucky we 'd all be if we could turn back time and live without shame or i imagine this will come close to if not win the audience favorite award 
 i had just reached when i first saw this series and i am watching it again on over years later the pictures over the opening credits have never left me it has affected my view of the world and the peoples in it my parents were with me long enough to have seen the series with me and we always discussed the it gave me a love for studying history and the highest marks i got in our school 's 
 one of the worst movies i have ever seen boring and stupid lots of drawn out into painful i like jeff but he should stick to acting and forget writing i am this is rated as high as it is i call it a turkey 
 maybe not all of it by the false promise of women on the movie 's cover but the the whatever you do do not watch this movie out your eyes repeatedly your in do what it takes never again never forget 
 lets make a movie about a talk show that already exists and basically have everything that happens on the show well if that idea does n't you which it should n't stay away from i had the of seeing this in the theater and actually being able to sit through this mess of a movie i guess jerry does n't play himself as it shows from the cheap for his show yes it looks even cheaper than the real jerry 
 i saw the film yesterday and stopped it at half time because i felt it was a waste of time the idea to make a film through the eyes of a one of the evil guys throughout most fantasy and films is great and offers plenty of possibilities but the film could n't catch one of them i was not feeling for any of the characters the plot was all too predictable to the point that i followed it and 
 i 'm sorry to say this but the acting in this film is horrible the dialogue sounds as if they are reading their lines for the first time ever perhaps i got the dress version by mistake the director slow motion during special effects perhaps as an attempt to compensate for the poor performance of the actors themselves the story is pretty well written and the fight are actually better than i have seen in many action films the fights 
 as most off you might off seen star wars return off the you may knows its a good movie but as you might have seen on video they have a party at the end and they just probably end the movie with the party with no a spirits or anything but on the original one live tv when they are but before i say more when ben dies in the imperial ship or death star they saw him disappear and 
 really bad why anyone thinks this is a good film let alone funny is a true mystery i like as much as the next man and i loved a christmas story the fact that it has the same director and was based on the same writer 's has me completely as to why this film is such a complete failure on every level charles is as the father for for another it does not seem to have the same it 
 this movie causes more than anything else i 've ever seen really if you are a fan rent it just to at it with your friends i wo n't be the person to apart its flaws all i will say is that the movie for me anyway lost major points for turning my favorite character sam into a shame shame 
 i 'm a fan of both shakespeare and so i waited to see this episode i 'll comment on the movie first then the episode the for this movie take actors rich and beautiful shakespeare material and a $ budget mix well then drain of all life and movement until and serve cold in a big plain stone movie i give N out of N because the actors at least deserve a little bit of credit now the episode i 
 this film was n't in italian i have seen it at a called find it terrible because some scenes seems like music chaotic and dark the use of colors is and there 's no in the film music is completely out of the story and i do n't have words to describe the you look at the first scene the film seems to be interesting but a few minutes later it becomes story is interesting but the development needs a 
 if you watched the series and love the league as i do then prepare to be disappointed i went to the with a group of league fans and we were all in agreement that this film was n't as funny or dark as the three series before in my personal opinion it was a money the writing was and the plot confused no not confusing just confused with what it was trying to do it was of the worst kind 
 back in the day if had had her and did n't just listen to william hearst she 'd have done more films like show people and been a lot in fact when you see her get her first big break in two comedy she 'd have loved to have done that in her career instead of such like when was in and meredith what you 're seeing by all accounts in show people is the real a a mimic and 
 i have become a big fan of the work of so maybe i am already a little by now but i think this movie is great although there may be a few it is a romantic view of the great liberation in the later great set design and in my opinion still very this is an ironic of the story of and who are driven from after having the fruit which has turned from an apple into a filled with 
 this movie is about carlos the an international terrorist who by cia agent henry fields 's appears to women and children for the of it at least that 's what he says to us naval officer ramirez again into taking on the of as carlos and setting him up as a in the eyes of the kgb ramirez is apparently identical to carlos but he is his he is of order and carlos is of movie is n't all action 
 let me start out by saying that i used to really like particularly from down way but by the time she got around to this disaster she had also got round and frankly the whole film was an embarrassment with douglas who must have been fairly desperate the story was bad the good and the film far too long it had some of the old in it like harry and to try and stimulate interest but with no success the 
 when i first saw this show i thought it looked interesting i watched it saw how it around like the character sees the world revolving around her i got it but was n't laughing very and in her show she 's crude and i did n't get her at first and took it all at face value then i got to see her movie is magic i think that served as a for me explaining to me just what ' 
 as a not going to comment on the great theory which changed the world N years ago safe to say science is based on evidence is based on blind faith said there film was produced by the and to be honest it could quite easily have been shown on television while the acting is the film itself is n't really worthy of a full release that said if it reaches a wider audience this way then so be it but 
 certainly this film has the ring of truth about it as it to be based on actual at a marine base it deals with the attempted by the local marine of conduct by a marine major which resulted in his being shot to death by his former girl friend a marine the man and woman had been but the attempted to break off the when she discovered her boy friend was married he continued to her going so far as 
 the woman is one of the most moving films i have ever seen in my entire life i watched it twice in a row and my eyes silent film deserves a much wider audience unfortunately the sole surviving print is so badly that most people wo n't watch it all the way through and they will miss the the rough this film could use a digital restoration to help bring out its beauty but i doubt it will get it 
 another french film with f me tells the story of two young women who come together to kill and f one of them is a star who from her community after being and killing her second one is a hooker who her and sees her being shot dead after those incidents they meet at a tube station both misses the last train then the whole thing starts they find a bound and come very close they abuse men take drugs 
 as a member of the cast i was a member of the band at all the basketball games i would like to let the world know after being in the movie that we were not allowed to see it since it was banned in oregon this was due to the producers and the director breaking the contract with the university of oregon where it was shot seems that the u of sign was shown while we were shooting we were 
 i was looking forward to seeing john carpenter 's episode in season N because his first cigarette burns was by far the best from season N and i did like other episodes from that season oh how i was fairness to carpenter i think the primary problem with this episode was absolutely horrible writing the characters aside from the subject matter seemed to and speak as though they were written for an episode of walker texas the acting was bad 
 i enjoy quality and this ranks up there with some of the the is out of this world or at least our world and the of a N foot in a outfit chasing after people is bad i quite enjoyed some of this but the acting is so awful and even the scene does n't really have any out in it just a complete waste of time if ever i saw one i do n't know who wasted more time 
 this film had no huge stars in it but did have a very good cast filled with excellent supporting actors and gene before she became a big star with george harry bruce and you 'd expect more from the film than it actually delivered most of this i suspect is because of a script as director henry was a competent and man at the film is set in east africa during just before the americans entered the war the are 
 the subject this latest tries to tackle in his debut ad venture is quite an topic of discussion by almost any cultural standard intended the exploration and for falls short as the usual to and sugar ' up the usual mix of score dance drama etc creates a package with not much the first N minutes of the movie the kitchen scene has been repeated at least times further follow the movie after all the lead character 's a cook

 this is absolutely the best ever maybe the best of all time it had everything action and much more i ca n't imagine how hard it was for company to make this great there has been spent a lot of money for this of work and it was worth it for example just the down scenes were hard because i would n't call the for a great technology year with computers like now in the world we live in so 
 N is the same as bad acting bad characters bad lines you name it i 'm not all that surprised that more people have n't seen this movie the only reason i watched N is because i wanted to think that the learned from their mistakes they did n't this movie is just as bad if not worse than the first one that that i hate him i hate him so much and i do n't hate him because he

 as a fan of studio and especially films i went to the film right on the opening day when i went out of the theater i had this strange feeling that something was missing this feeling i was experiencing in all films before but i could n't say why it failed this time after i thought about the other movies i may know the reason this film had most of the elements of a great characters wonderful key a great 
 the has all to the academy its director joe wright has already a best picture candidate the leading actor robert downey jr. in a widely praised film finally the movie itself is a drama when it was pulled from release in late N and critics were now that i 've seen it i assure you universal did n't just delay this film to promote iron the is a weak drama with no external conflict that is to any N best

 this is almost certainly the worst western i 've ever seen the story follows a formula that is especially common to and arts films hero that have been murdered so hero sets out to exact the the and the expert in a this formula has often been successful otherwise it would n't be a formula but is the most execution of it you 'll ever see the is and it sounds like a high wrote the dialogue because it lacks

 it was a rare treat to see checking out i was touched by the characters a lot at the wonderful script and was deeply moved by the genuine portrayed by this cast and especially by peter in fact one of his scenes in the kitchen of his apartment with his children where he tells of his experience of his life his deep love for his wife and his decisions about his life going forward is so real that it is 
 to say this film would be to as the other says this movie is to anyone over the mental age of N it is especially to it is awful and not in a so bad it 's funny sort of way either it 's just plain awful no i have to say it it sorry the opening credits to the end titles there is hardly more than N seconds of this movie worth opening your eyes for the plot is

 this first two seasons of this comedy series were very strange and they were n't very funny and had a drama element where bill the mother was struggling with all the usual problems in life but that element was a bit and did n't mix well with comedy elements which is probably why it was dropped after that it soon became one of the comedy series the have ever made the chemistry between bill and ben 's character 's were

 i first saw this movie as a younger child my sister had told me about it and i thought it would be more of a kid 's movie however it remains to also be an incredible movie true that the subject behind the movie is but also true this movie will never stop your was only N when i first saw it and just yesterday N years later i saw it again for the first time in a long time 
 a ghost story on a typical high school with nice sound and effects brothers had made their first shots on a a couple of years ago as far as i know that was kind of a they had very nice stories but lacked on effects this time it seems they had what they needed and used them well this movie will make you that 's for sure and as well it might have you scared it has a nice plot 
 it took a long time until i could find the title in a special in berlin and i was lucky to find an english version with i think one of the best ever it seems strange for me that some people call this movie a black comedy i must admit i able to about when i saw it the first time and it was the same with the second time on the one hand seems so nice and even in 
 this is not your typical indian film there is some great sense of and the characters are pretty realistic there is great in the relationships and there is a sense of passion among the many characters while seeing this one gets a feel for the heavy burden of the N years of and of history of social existence of one of the oldest the final scene of an elephant walking away in the rural area was a great to such 
 i the contains box in case i say anything that is a and do n't i 've said it until i it after i 've posted so it 's just in back to reviewing this saw this film on earlier on this afternoon and by the sky gives you these people must be on acid it sounded pretty good but then when i actually got about N minutes into it i was this film in my opinion has the worst 
 this movie was so bad it was i could n't resist watching it though the plot is standard the acting quite horrible supporting cast such as the neighbor and the lawyer friend were better actors kind of amusing if you have some time to waste and like seeing the conclusion to a dramatic who plays was just because i could n't decide if her flat affect was the result of bad surgery or simply bad acting i decided it was 
 i absolutely this movie no wonder jose it at one point and refuses to discuss it i 's work especially his more like or and die his work has a kind of about it that he ca n't seem to switch off in part to his secondary career as a & it 's too bad he never made a western his vision would have been is easily his most notorious film and probably his best known after the and it 
 is a movie about lost a on the road ever the road of no return the plot is about a couple that set out to find a better life in california the man david in his best role up to now wants to write a book about the famous crimes that have happened in america and his girl who is a is going to take the pictures so they set out on a trail of famous not knowing what them 
 as other have this was a very very bad movie keeping it kid friendly was low class they should of spent the $ N on a coke as is typical with these d movies most victims die and leave a mystery except for one lucky soul and of course the lead hope the money was worth it for really really big step down from nice to see what happened to buck rogers but damn this was low even for him 
 i sat down through N hours of pure i look here on even though it is not high on the list it is in the top i was a little even though yes i am very impressed with robin and 's acting they still did n't save the movie i 'm not sure what i really did n't like about the movie maybe it 's because i maybe i 'm not too much for talking for N hours even though 
 if you liked the richard version of the identity then you will like this too does this one you ca n't help but wonder if he is really out there i he and the other main cast members probably had for weeks after doing this movie as it 's so intense when i first saw it i was just channels on the late one evening & i got within minutes look up for who is the character that carlos the 
 this has to be one of the biggest ever the script was nice and could have ended a lot actors should have played better and maybe then i would have given this movie a slightly better grade maybe hollywood should this movie with some little better actors and better guys for disappointment but the movie is i had to it it would be like i do n't want to everyone 's opinion with mine so my advice is watch the 
 ralph and in their own land get into being of twice upon a time is the story of them the characters they meet and their struggle to set things right with a surprisingly impressive and wonderful voice acting by some of the best in the business this movie hits the process while similar to that of the cut out south park style is much and far more if i did n't know that the was this style i would that 
 if i could give it less that N i would do not bother to rent if someone gives you the is horrible movie making a total waste of even digital film i have seen better on made by N year old boys claims to have written this if that is the case he is a classic case of someone who is in two the story line is none the is mainly the camera work is some sort of attempted with 
 that something like this could find its way to be viewed by the public i knew it was by & i found it in the bargain at a store for $ N still pretty steep considering but led me to view this and N i am fairly sure this is a of seven of the and american all rolled into one with that may have been written by van plays the main character and he 's so absolutely bizarre and 
 lee jones was the best and no one can play f. call better than he not only was he the first and best he was the only person that could his and confusion it was a bad and i 'm surprised i even made myself watch it i can even begin how how they made i understand he would be old by that time but everyone knows that he would never let that pull him down the first movie was 
 so this is the worst movie you will probably ever see it 's up there with and southern comfort but if your a bad movie fan like i am this of a film will be the most fun you 've had in years why does the camera make when it why does that random guy stuff a plate in his bag and who is he anyway why do the shoot after they die what is this who just at it 
 i this movie the other day i love stories but this has got to be the worst one i have ever seen in my life i find it hard to believe that sam would fall in love with after they 've said hardly no more than N words to each other when she has a great who 's devoted to her completely i thought was a major throughout the movie and he never changed at all the only good thing 
 i was surprised to find this movie showing as a in my local have all seen this plot line before top gun an officer and a but a good script still works this story is basically about the training of a coast guard rescue team with a couple of side story lines kevin plays a highly successful rescue team leader ben who is forced into heading the training team after a tough mission the movie takes us through the of 
 awful dreams wild and homosexual paul 's of a true who her men then them filled with blood and the fourth man is truly men will literally leap when swings out her 
 i loved that this film recognizes the intelligence of the allowing the to from the characters through their with each other about the loss that has so affected each of them the is a beautiful and is an inspired reflection of the vision of someone i believe is an extremely new with the maturity and artistic insight to tell a story that others with much more experience have failed to accomplish i see a bright future for this who had 
 what some try and practically never succeed creating somehow connections between persons without becoming manages this beautiful movie perfectly well in that way a little to the wonderful double de ' of the same director and with the same beautiful actress this is a real movie that changes perspective of life a little bit and beautiful story directed excellent main actors i 've just seen the movie the or time and i still think it 's one of the best 
 well i get used after to read comments about these movies that do n't reflect my experience at all to me was a better here than in some of his most famous movies he was a a to me it was a breath of fresh air to see him in a role where his is n't sort of undercut in some kid who played was probably over his head with this cast there i think maybe the director could have 
 what a great show a very dramatic show it is great how there are no main characters and every episode some other character s are the main character s think the best character on the show is he is a tough bad guy and an on top of that which makes him a true bad guy prisoner who there are many that are known to be this show has many i think it is a little over for the killing 
 the man is a movie from N a cutting edge film for it 's time where appeared to rest on top of a man who was truly go ahead take a look at the film you will be shocked that it was made in N it was the first true special effects movie come N computer aided special effects seem like child 's play audiences are not away by special effects instead they are disappointed if they are not done

 just this movie after seven years i was years old and caught this on south beach at the long gone theater on washington avenue in N i thought where it 's at was a very good movie now however after almost years it 's not as good as it was times have changed and this movie is now a tired old of the war between the generations it did however catch a place in time which is just a memory

 parker and stone the of south park finally get out of their schedule to talk to the cameras while champagne in their hot at first when watching this i did not sense as much as there was in this i knew they were when they would complain about different actors on the show and when said he was n't going to give his mother any of his money but there is so much throughout that this is more of a 
 i saw beyond about N times it was that good at first when i watched it i saw the story of but later after multiple i that this also was a parallel it came to be in my mind a story about san and the struggles of women to remain strong in the face of uncertainty danger and i also would put history and politics on the list after further since i did learn a lot about 's past and

 i missed the beginning of this film which might account for why i it so much on the other hand i 've studied the fall of the roman republic for years so i know the story then again that might also be the reason why i this film has more historical than though it 's so inaccurate that i do n't think they made an attempt for it to be correct in which case it can be the odd thing 
 i this movie everyone and their 's sister 's lawyer 's needs to own it its and full of with this movie those amazing people at offer you a whole new perspective into the story of and in ways you never would have thought to be possible it has all the of an instant classic car crashes sex scenes families street fights amazing music heads and from the story line and only a taste of what it has to offer 
 i into this movie not because i am a fan of u.s. high school basketball in fact i only rarely watch games but rather because i am a fan of gene who usually manages to bring an impressive to his performances in this case however i was disappointed this was not one of the bright stars of 's fairness to him he did n't have a lot to work with as norman dale the new coach of a small town 
 the first intentions the original is my favorite movie of all time it was an so how on earth could they make a so downright bad was perfect in the first movie in this one adams she is terrible and could n't they have found a who actually looked like at least the same hair color i mean come on robin dunn is n't as bad as adams but he is absolutely terrible when compared to the in the first 
 i think that can sum up this show about as well as anything batman may be the worst thing to ever happen to based on comic books because everything that comes after will be compared to it and nothing has measured up yet it 's just too damn good was batman beyond good but it was no is justice league good it 's not too bad but it 's no the batman is certainly no either but i wo n't 
 oh my how can they make movies of such beauty but that are so bad i mean even does n't make like this there is not even a hint of a decent story characters or attraction it 's just a random of joined together to make a ' i only children up to N years of age could enjoy it given the world is so utterly and the story so that anyone older would be by it but then again 
 i 'd love to write a little summary of this movie 's plot but there simply is n't one if you just take a look at the plot for this title you pretty much know the entire content of the film sex female and women 's prison N minutes of pure and nothing more escape of the island women an title that is n't even listed here clearly wanted to become another notorious and controversial classic but it totally lacks 
 i really liked this movie it was i enjoyed it but if you did n't that is your fault roberts played a good nancy drew even though she is n't quite like the books the old fashion are weird when you see them in modern times but she looks good on them to me the rich did n't have that made them look rich i mean it looks like they got all the clothes at a garage sale and just

 the history of the fbi as told from the point of view of agent stewart via with his personal life story stewart and miles as his wife are pretty good as is hamilton as an agent the problem is that the nature of the story makes it difficult to get involved it 's like watching and pieces of a dozen different movies as we get of a who 's who cast of some of the episodes are too long some 
 just finished watching this movie i could n't imagine watching this on as there were scenes where i needed the to hear through an or sound effect even though the scene itself was in the movie is pretty appealing the few effects were very obvious but the effects were n't bad not perfect but photography and which were pretty good made up for a lot acting was generally bad though how much of that can be blamed on the director 
 tom plays an son to pop don and mom anne jackson making up for his one and taking them in after has burned down his mobile home meanwhile 's job is by the his assets are frozen his wife and kids leave him and his sister and her have come to stay is as out of touch with reality as 's old perhaps a serious first draft with scenes such as walking out into traffic with two was incorporated into 
 robert montgomery and robert young are outstanding as a duo of young officers in italy during world war i. the is highly entertaining and is as the ship 's cook walter 's character is as the of the a example of an officer and a one of the most interesting aspects of this movie was the level of technology displayed in the battle scenes i was surprised at how similar the technology of world war i was to the technology 
 i recently saw this movie in my international business class i was not expecting anything other then another boring not to say i do n't love i 've just hard bad luck with movies in that class imagine my surprise when this movie that 's actually a movie came up this film is a tell all of cultural differences in the work place and how they need to cooperate to get anywhere the culture clash shows just how different the

 the of anne frank is the second book in the world and for good reason nonetheless sitting through this about her life which in some of the details where the left off i thought just another about anne frank i found it to be competent but not extraordinary that was my attitude because i was already well aware of the story of anne frank most of what the had to tell me was n't news to changed though when i

 very good dramatic comedy about a playwright trying to figure out how to keep his head above water after running out of ideas ca n't say much about this film without giving away the story i can say that little was as it seems as you are watching the picture everybody has his or her own agenda nice little surprise at the end after all the other surprises well written with good performances by all 
 this movie was a complete waste of time the was bad story was and predictable and the acting was terrible one of the worst N movies i have ever seen after the first ten minutes the rest of the film was completely obvious

 is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this there 's a bunch of about b acting supposedly silly and we are supposed to there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far this is not a movie this is trash i ca 
 i remembered seeing this movie when i was a kid one day on the wonderful world of disney this movie has been in my memory for over N years and i have been looking for it i would have to say that out of all the kids movies i saw back then this one stuck out more than all of them and after only seeing it once i really hoped i would get to see it again the story and 
 i agree with the who said that strange people with generous have been reviewing this film i thought the film was intriguing enough to watch it i think that was primarily because of and not the bottom line is that this film is mildly on the one hand and on the other up on the former and triple down on the latter i 'm not sure if the film is intended to promote dialogue or to spread fear and thought 
 following which the touted update goes and itself through the head rather apt considering the sorry state of this movie a to a film which did n't need really about N is that the makers obviously did n't understand why the original was so good in the first place N was a of bad action movies N is just a bad action on dialogue particularly the it attracts little interest and none of the energy or spirit of the original 
 talk about awful do not waste your time i wish i had seen the other use comments first i have to admit i did n't watch the whole thing it was just too horrible the worst dialogue i could go on and on but what really made it was the direction the poor actors you ca n't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have lines to speak but the director gave them no action if

 this is a silly movie with much and acting is average but writing leaves something to be there are performances by buddy with a short but outstanding performance by rose as the bitter wife of a rich a totally portrayal of college life which ends with a ice of alice in many parts are worth watching but do not be afraid to fast forward through parts of the movie

 this is probably the worst film i have ever seen mike tries to be a dramatic actor and fails the children who have the major roles are almost impossible to understand and are really characters it was not even worth the price of the rental 
 river 's edge is not a film to watch but it is an incredible one having viewed it many years ago i truly think it would still have the ability to shock were it to be released or or something perhaps no movie ever made has captured the of young suburban like this movie given that this is based on a true story it is even more disturbing very well acted and just at many times to watch but also 
 i saw the in and thought it could be a cool film turns out it is an awful garbage there is n't much in the film not to mention not having much sex either there were just some and along with some you usually expect to see during in our case you may even see it in the actual films conclusion i ai n't got none for it just leave it alone 
 not because of the which at times was used to provide good deep but what a ending the end of the movie just seems to on itself this film has got to be one of the movie ever and one of the most attempts to try to explain it the of this film is painful as well if you are looking for a bad film to at go for it otherwise look for better films

 i could n't to this film i 'm surprised that people are it for being so ' how many people at your school were victim to incest how many homosexual were there how many quiet people that you never noticed committed ok you would n't know even if their were but really these are explosive problems which many us never deal with and yet there are so many with problems which could have been but where 's the ' in

 not saying much this film has better and is more professional looking than the last that does n't mean it 's more professional that horrible last film was about killing a kid and then being by a i thought the guy that played in the last one was a bad actor but this is the downright worst actor i 've seen in any movie and i 've seen a lot of movies last movie the came in about N minutes 
 the the amazing the a few ways to describe this movie yes it 's slow and it has mostly talking but the whole story of all of their lives and how it 's told with the thrown in and out makes you want to listen to every little thing to learn more about this and story i myself am reading the book that the movie is based off of and it has shown me even more light into this story 
 my love of italian actress who helped my with her performance in N 's has led me to some fairly unusual places case in point this british from N of the which features in one of her earlier roles she plays a in this one although the picture is actually a for the of and peter sellers both of whose stars were certainly on the rise at this point in this often very funny film we learn of the island

 this movie is just plain terrible slow acting slow at getting to the point and wooden characters that just should n't have been on there the best part was the showing of iron in some video at a theater and it the ending was worth watching and waiting up for but that was it the characters in this movie put me to sleep almost avoid it

 the of films really takes a dive in this one the big problem is i realize that you need to create difficult situations which would cause and the feeling of going to happen next but this movie was so predictable and is just not i find that the more i watch this kind of movie the more i am continually saying things to actors to direct them away from danger continually making bad decisions just borders on being plain stupid

 i 've been a fan of jim and his characters since the very beginning the most thing about them was the love and and shown was a role model of deep thinking and problem solving a character yet and so all the other characters were slightly but it demonstrated how different kinds of beings can in a manner together each other 's movies have somewhat kept the same yet this it 's a very christmas movie would have jim in

 of a minute is one of the better films to come out of michigan in recent years not to say that it 's a brilliant film by any means but it 's definitely worth a watch the of eric played by director a formerly abused child now grown up and starting to listen to his evil side is very nice the shots are creative and the lighting is moody and interesting to look at this film actually has an element 
 committed is all about graham as an who goes in search of her husband who has gone in search of himself which all leads to a sort of upbeat involving a bunch of side characters and issues a fresh fun and little what committed lacks in story it makes up for in good and and if you enjoy this little which received slightly above average reviews by critics and public alike you might want to check out 's hit &

 for a low budget project the film was a success the story is interesting and the actors were convincing who now stars on the tv show is than ever the locations were ideal for the plot and the director shows his talent by taking on many roles for his project of course this low budget film could use better and more special effects for the gun scenes but the music keeps this script moving although this film has it 's

 i 'm shocked that all the it ratings are and still above average to me this seems a case of the has no clothes i understand this film was produced on a very low budget in the early N 's regardless it became a struggle to sit through and watch the i saw did have some but about N of the speech is not some of it is hard to understand the was cool to hear but you struggle not

 this movie starts out a little slow but into gear quickly each of the three offer their own distinct and entertaining i particularly enjoyed the and between keith and if one looked beyond the action that was taking place keith 's character treated 's with and consideration the comic development that followed was also pulled in in my opinion david gives a wonderful performance as the adult male who clearly gets himself into more trouble than he can handle dialogue 
 little sister and i are movie we have seen just about everything especially now we have seen a lot of good movies and a lot of bad ones this by far is the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life not only was the acting horrible but the special effects graphics and ever was the worst i have seen if you can even call it black eye shadow around the eyes this is totally proof that you

 man this gets a lot of good reviews in the review books frankly i found it too slow and right from the start i kept waiting for it to pick up a little steam but that never happened this movie is with the king james english has never appealed to me anyway so it may just be me there is a fair share of the latter in the first half of the film as they show ronald playing the role 
 this is without doubt the best ever produced giving an accurate and of world war N from the of poland in N to the end of the war in and to the point this presents views from both sides of the conflict giving a very human face to the war at the same time tactics and the importance of are not much work has been put into the giving a detailed picture of the war and in particularly the high

 i watched this movie out of a lack of anything else on at the time quickly the movie grabbed me with the of the characters and plot i was quite surprised to see that the rating given by my satellite provider did not show any will not give any to the or outcome but most of the characters had at least some value until the very last minute i did not know how it would turn out frequently you can

 i saw this series when it world at the toronto film festival i liked the idea behind the film where two men got together and told a director from each country to direct a movie about these directors never met before until the project was complete and they saw how it looked all together warning ahead all the pieces were very powerful and some were controversial if you are an american then you may not like this as some of

 the is a film that boasts a really house good effects work and sound work a cast that seems to believe that everything around them is real and that house there are scenes that make you jump and the aspects of what went on at hill house in the past i found interesting there are moments in the film and i liked the way the ghosts themselves in sheets and the house itself jerry goldsmith 's score gave it the 
 i watched this last night on tv hbo i have to admit that the tension in this movie was by most other era movies i loved the way chip would be all calm one moment and then violent the very next moment it was classic yes the the the and it has it all this movie delivered all the goods to me i especially loved the way they mixed communism into the plot very common for this era of movie

 i have never read a novel but i have also seen valley of the based on another of her books on both occasions i thought the movie is probably better than the book and will further improve with age certainly contrary to the books the reason being that a movie focuses more on a specific style in fashion design and behavior patterns and in this aspect the love machine offers quite a lot the set design fits the story perfectly 
 i was not nearly as with this as many other sure it has a pair of lovely playing morris and d. play these two lovely with teeth that run up to cars on a road out of the way to their home at and their men to their what happens there well after they and each other mostly they kill their visitors director jose does have some of with his camera some scenes are quite and effectively shot but sex 
 this movie started out but it was meant to with an mother a of a rival and a beauty queen constantly coming in second there was some and a few plot points she comes in second in every single competition all of them unfortunately the movie from it 's need to well be a tv movie rather than end at the ending of the movie an amusing twist in which the killer is revealed the movie continues for another minutes

 this series only follows N memory the story takes place during the same time line as the original in the year N the time of the one year war but the mobile suits are designed as new models are and are as a result look more the hero of the story is a young who may lack any real combat experience but makes up for it with creativity and life get complicated when he meets a pilot the enemy the

 many mystery stories follow the standard path murder most gathering of clues of possible of red and inevitable between and even more crime forgotten the and gives us complex characters who may or may not have committed terrible acts the fact that at the end of three episodes we have no easy answers and no package might some but for me it was the indication of an tale which and haunts with the question what does an evil person look

 thin story concerns two small town brothers and their struggles over family honor david is the responsible and ' brother the ' boy is a former and as an actor particularly in his earliest years penn seems to have his performances under the method turning first-time writer and director for this drama he works his script and characters out through the same process slowing the down to a so we can catch every and this approach might be if there 
 i had seen this movie when i was a boy before and was surprised that the local library had a copy saw it again after some years and how bad it was this is an example of a movie that was not a a movie no poor script weak acting and not much should not even be as high as a b had a at how i 've become over the years seems to me i thought it was good

 if you came into the film with expectations throw them away now because no amount of will do this film this film into a single would be criminal it 's a spy has elements of and pieces of action science and all tied together with a brilliant plot and lot of the comments here have centered around it being derivative both in good and bad ways of other movies but as they say every story from shakespeare so once you 
 despite the previous 's this is a well and interesting with lots of from classic films that influenced and others in their more recent efforts i agree that 's films are n't even in the same league as the films discussed here such as william ' brilliant from to name just one of the many titles examined but this is still a good of yes it turns into a commercial for the of war of the during the last minutes

 after what is going on around us in the news in our homes the whole new world i remembered this show and how i was watching it every week in my town i started looking for this series N days ago have luck till this moment and i was shocked when i read about it and about cbs people i believe they stopped the show because it 's talking about something way ahead of our understanding of the new world 
 i had few problems with this film and i have heard a lot of criticisms saying it is and true it is over three hours long but i was that it goes by so quickly i do n't think it is at all i think the rating is perfectly decent the film looks with and excellent effects and the direction from james rarely from focus gives one of his best performances as jack and kate is lovely as rose david 
 this program is a lot of fun and the title song is so i ca n't get it out of my head i find as i get older i am drawn to the who get things done and these four are excellent in their some of what they do is but brilliant considering that now days with our pc world we 'd never be able to do it in real life i always learn something from the shows but if

 this is one of the most and movies i 've seen in a long time i was into sticking with it since donald 's presence gave it some credibility that 's the last time that 'll happen ann warren 's character was and as stupid as they come there were characters than who were killed in the film just one of many things in this movie that made me ask where is the justice why is cable so filled with 
 air N golden receiver is a very bad in making a in the course of a single year the first film was and the idea of a dog playing on a basketball team is quite far but he pulled off enough to save the concept even the human story had some explanation to it 's father was killed in a plane crash so he is sad and the audience becomes involved as for the poorly made it is terrible this 
 i think i will make a movie next weekend oh wait i 'm working oh i 'm sure i can fit it in it looks like whoever made this film fit it in i hope the makers of this have day jobs because this film it looks like home movie and i do n't think more than $ N was spent making it total who let 's this stuff be released 
 after watching this movie on tv i looked it up in the and imagine to my surprise a user rating of this is not a good film especially bad is the the poor way the story from one point to another was and a huge it 's not very done i do agree that the acting was fairly decent especially kelly and that the story was intriguing enough 
 how often do we live our romantic life as on the big screen with affairs and almost never if what i see as normal life around me is anything to judge by as previously stated are hardly ever affairs that leave you at the top of the world or and in its every day form as lived out millions of times over around the world is a slow and quiet affair something that grows in you ever so slowly probably 
 after seeing the tv commercials for this film i marched to my local expecting a lot of in the end it was one of the longest i have ever spent the boy really did fail to provide a story line with enough substance to hold my interest and predictable and sometimes jokes did n't fill this scene where the two boys ' dominate the of their local was the only one that impressed me at all the only character that

 this is an incredible piece of drama and powerful which hits you i found the film was great and getting to with the two main characters this was represented in a great performance by both two michael and whether the story is based around a true story i feel the story was trying to giving the audience a message that as a whole the general public should respect and feel for the needs of disabled people and that they should 
 why does this movie fall well below standards ultimately the answer lies in the poor script a looking looking rather in black i must say even with a huge and gross both act very well as two ' but nevertheless new eager to open their own other than that the rest of the film is just boring to watch it is so that it 's really not worth knowing what happens in the film 's on any level kelly obviously 
 i mean i mean saw this movie back when i was eight in back then films were a and good ones even more so also back then we to things called cd players but i i used to like this movie a lot way back then and up till it again i 've held memories of it it 's don anyone who all dogs go to is clearly a robot but again i i saw it again this really is

 bad bad bad how do movies like this get made badly written poorly acted i could go on but why bother as an aside note that the characters ' first names are the same as the actors playing them this is a dead that no one on the set is even interested enough in their role to bother learning someone else 's characters names 
 long whoever said that has got to be this has got to be one of the most in behind the scenes or making of ever made how can it be a when several minutes are spent telling the audience how the movie was and then brought to the studios this also spends lots and lots of time detailing how were done and the new technologies created to achieve them then it shows us how woo 's team came up with 
 the film opens with a leader attempting to a dead member with his for his as the sun strikes upon them in the desert bill roy believes in his power and gets so worked up that he with what appeared to be a heart attack unable to keep him alive all those involved doctors and nurses are sentenced for attack with 's spirit the body of jacobson targeting each one using her as a tool of forced against her will 
 i truly fell in love with the characters they were very down to earth but each and every one of them had a hidden dark side sort of a mystery david himself was an the secret fears and just secrets in general that he had there was a whole side of him that the other characters knew nothing about and it left the audience either wondering or assuming there was always a part of this man that he would keep 
 i first saw this movie in the night program of one of my tv channels i was from the very first minute nothing is as it first seems lots of great acting from mr. van and i did not mind the heat in it one bit and best of all you are in for a surprise ending

 this is one of the worst movies ever made predictable only thing that rated one point was there was a few nice scenes i imagine they would use films like this in or some other hidden prison to bad movies have some features this has nothing if i was in it or worked on it i would change my name truly a hard to write more than this but i feel the world 's film watchers needed a head 's 
 it seems that all companies that are enjoy with the taxes taken by for picture grant the image that disappear since N are hardly try to get the oldest car the had founded but they never take pictures of the martin and all new mercedes that are more the you can find in some important second problem is that they in some neighborhoods in where they had the possibility of clear the streets and put on people with i do 
 this film probably would have been good if they did n't use computer generated for the made the creatures look fake and the looked is great for certain effects like the in park or when we see a film where the must look completely real is not the way to at an american in makeup and a mechanical and what you come up with was more realistic than what was shown in the film did offer a few that was 
 what a disaster normally when one a historical movie it 's always fun to point out the that slip in usually added by the writers to create more dramatic situations however is a whole kind of animal in this movie you strain to find anything at all that is confirmed by the historical record the of nonsense and presented as the life of rome 's it 's a because is one of the most of all the roman his life 
 i remember catching this film on a a year ago and i was completely away by the whole thing i thought the film managed to represent such a diversity of the a love story the of crime and so many was on the whole thing after a minute or so and was really concerned about the characters it made me feel at one second for and then had me laughing away at the in the next and all the time 
 a group of look to find their way home after being by a greedy is regarded as one of walt disney 's with its script and cool characters but it does n't quite have the magic that created snow white or the slow opening will have younger viewers raising their but once the become established into the story does the fun and entertainment young create the most with a young the special kind of any brother or sister of any 
 i love so much about this movie the music the the acting the story and all the just because they are does n't mean they are n't true this is not perfect it is a movie after all though are held in rooms with nice big desks and chairs it was totally appropriate to it as the dark cold scene they did in this film i also liked the scene with the waiting at the bus stop smoking a cigarette 
 this is john waters best film to date the characters are obvious and just as in his other films so there are no surprises or character changes i enjoyed the film because of the and pace of the story it was good with honest people 
 having read all of the comments on this film i am still at fox 's reluctance to release a full screen restored version in yes the history may be a bit inaccurate and it is certainly not as powerful as the book but it was the film by fox made in real and the production values alone merit a restoration and distribution i saw this film in second grade and it triggered my interest in all things egyptian in my 
 i guess this movie is compared to some of 's other films the plot is overly familiar the and some of the acting is n't too good but it 's worth seeing for the lengthy stretch near the end of the film where we see in a blue with the half it seems like a point when discussing an actress of 's talent but she also happens to be an extremely woman and back in the day she had a

 i found this movie quite by accident but am happy that i did kenneth 's performance came close to stealing this movie from carter but their strong chemistry together made for a much more movie this movie brought to mind the excellent movies that made with thompson carter 's star turn here as a disabled young women seeking to complete herself was as good a performance as i have seen from a female lead in a long time portraying a 
 think of the most subject you can and this is N times worse a woman needs to complete as many as she can in a day we do n't even get to see the questions and think of the words on our own we just watch her struggle the woman seems so anxious and in a hurry to do the but for some reason she spends the time walking all around the city when she could be focused at home 
 is the kind of movie you ca n't describe on a or in a or it 's the kind of movie that you walk in to expecting a more mature and what with temporarily goes on a cross country while avoiding trying to kill fact is this film is a wonderful tale about two people chasing their dreams the best part about is it 's director neil uses violence to dreams from reality and along with the drama and comedy 
 i watched this in the early sam proved himself to be a great actor in fact when he began law and order i was disappointed in him as it was not as powerful a role unfortunately the good roles do not pay the bills i wish i could find a copy of this rare series and review it it is both and entertaining everyone should see it to know what really happened i was so moved i purchased and read 
 from the beginning of the show was there she was one of the best characters why did they get rid of her the show not the same as before its way best episodes were with in them you ca n't replace someone from the beginning that is like south park without or child 's play without it 's not right the who replaced her is just awful she does n't fit into the at all she was one of the 
 i made a big mistake going to see this film that 's the of going to see films i guess after five minutes you just knew it was going to be a and i fought quite hard to stay in my seat the old lose two hours of your life kind of fundamental problem is that without even the whole historical of reviews the script is painful first minutes could have been spread out to an hour to give a 
 depending entirely on your own personal state of mind when watching this christmas evil can either turn out to become an ambitious and innovative psychological or one of the most and ever made me personally i 'm to for the latter because i did n't bother to do any research at all and simply anticipated a and early N 's with a in a santa clause people wrong the movie actually handles about a named harry who 's with christmas 
 one would expect a movie with a famous in the lead role to be a funny movie this is not the case here i out loud once throughout the whole movie and that was n't even during the final which one would also expect to be the this is one you can watch when it comes to tv do n't spend any other money it 
 why did the of mary and have to be so women with daughters and why very little reference to the original show and characters the daughter characters were silly and why ca n't there ever be daughters who like their mother 's on tv it makes sense that mary would leave minneapolis and would return to but why could n't or sue ann be guest stars it just seems a way to remember such wonderful characters it was good to

 the truth and reconciliation process in south africa is a vital and probably unique human experiment this movie does an excellent job of the of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process almost every country has some part of its own history which is still a source

 our america is with so many this movie simply tells a story of a in time within one of these it is basically an objective look at a group of forgotten people living their lives to the rest of the world generally a good movie it provoked thought and showed lives that would not be seen otherwise right in our own back yard should be seen by all having lived in the u.s. all my life i had no idea 
 it is the early morning of our and some friends of mine and i have just gotten through watching the wind truly a disaster film not in the sense of forces of nature havoc on an but rather an awful movie havoc on an audience to give you an indication of how frustrating it was to watch this particular bomb i 'll give you an example quoted during my first if given the choice of watching this movie for a

 it 's really rare that you get an inside view at a media that has been so widely reported as official truth and caught so many news agencies with their down this movie in my view deserves every price there is in journalism it 's objective yes and a real it can do without comment fake scenes or leading questions everyone including equally gets to make of themselves in their own words the only had to keep track of events 
 why is it that every time i mention this movie to somebody i have to hear N minutes of about it i have come to the conclusion that any movie that has a twist upon a twist is deemed by anyone who watches it is that really what film has become or is it that any time someone says that is so cool everybody has to agree with them and has no opinion of their own how this movie has

 as someone who baseball history especially the early century in which was a main figure along with a ton of characters i was looking forward to seeing this baseball film well it was n't a baseball film which was disappointing no it was just a 's account of being with in the 's later years while the two on a book even at that this could have been a more appealing movie than they made was anything but a nice 
 my thoughts on the movie was not good not good at all it was great i was pleased with the the camera etc however the characters plot it movie seemed more new age than anything else organized is presented as and fearful science is n't portrayed any better it creates a monster weapon that everything but have the power to destroy and bring life really that 's something that my a bit too here we have a movie created with

 if you like really movies this is for you the acting is the worst i 've ever seen and the story line goes if you come across this film in your video shop do n't even consider borrowing it the on the front cover is n't even the one in the gave this movie only because i could n't vote avoid it at all costs

 the title has no to the movie it started off fine with good development but got when he could n't tell his girlfriend what had happened to him even his attempt to tell the police failed which just added to the value there were too many pregnant in the movie that seemed more like than anything the plot never revealed who did this crime to him although a good plot would have allowed disclosure the ending was nothing short of 
 halloween is one of the best examples of independent film it 's very well made and has more psychological elements to it than you might realize at first it is a simple movie told very well the music is perfect and is one of the most scores if you have n't seen this movie yet you must check it out the cast is all i wish they had never made after the first one was by far the best and 
 i must say as a girl with a of my own i love this left me them and even told my friend about it and she loved it just as much we were N at the think it 's the greatest love story ever told i own it and never get tired of & 
 i must admit that this is one of the worst movies i 've ever seen i thought dennis had a little more taste than to appear in this kind of if this is supposed to be funny then i got look around for a new sense of humor if you 're thinking of buying this movie you 'd better think again 
 this movie is a total dog i found myself to find anything to at just so i would n't feel like i 'd totally wasted my money and my time the writing in this film is absolutely terrible it 's a shame it 's not up to the standards of other storm should have saved the money on getting actors like fred and gary coleman and spent the money working the script until it was right even gary coleman was 
 with several name actors david warner joe don baker why was given the lead would have been a perfect fit for the lead as would warner baker or even others in the movie such as charles was in this and did a poor job of it everything he did seemed fake or script is poor meaning that if or another had the lead role he might have saved the film removed it from my waste of time category but it 
 the future of fantasy never looked so dark christopher lambert gets to fight the evil in this grim looking i said there 's only one location so you ca n't really call it an can you the location is a N inch tall castle so how did they manage to in all the actors oh i get it those where special effects a silly 's some reasons why you might want or not want to watch this motion picture lambert 
 the title leads viewers to believe that this is a fun movie to watch and probably much better when watched under the influence but it is not good at all one N minute with jack black playing one of his and on acid while through the woods does not save this movie at all every actor in this movie has gone on to do better things except for the main i could not think of one movie where i had 
 for the most part michael is a disaster ten minutes of and 's worth of and do their best frequently rising above nora 's script but the film moves like a and even within its fantasy context the characters on a regular basis reporters who routinely let the story of a lifetime an apparent living on earth out of their sight someone to tell romantic comedy that william hurt brilliant in so many other films is no tom the movie 
 N minutes of is a to bill at the high school dance to big a of 's bread nearly gets the of crown international features you must remember that these films were never designed to be watched start to finish on players they were made as N minutes of so the of the would have a as they got it on in their and the lack of and structure did n't matter to the original audience they probably only in 
 i saw the movie in the theater at its release then watched the tape over the years and while through target saw this with pushing for the sum of $ is something about this comedy that has really with me how with a on his thing is an who a diesel and a crew of and he 's up against the navy 's best a los angeles class nuclear attack and his old macy plays the bad guy torn the 
 dog dog is n't going to be for everyone but i really enjoyed it full of and shooting but do n't worry the lead 's a terrible shot it can best be described as a violent through hong kong and cambodia edison plays a in town to kill a despite being from his he 's almost immediately at a huge table in the middle of an obviously expensive restaurant if this sounds wildly to you you should probably avoid this 
 halloween is one of those movies that gets you skin deep it is in my opinion the movie of all time michael is the best ever he was just so what makes halloween so special is that there was no special effects where you can tell how computer it is this was on a low budget and had a one note score yet managed to scare the hell out of people N years and this movie still has the same 
 i saw this with high expectations come on it is and who are all amazing at their comedy i was really hoping for a that is not what i got at all unfortunately nothing in this movie really made me out loud there were times when i at one or two things but nothing really made me in short it was badly attempted comedy and in a way a bit of a of the three main guys i think 's 
 a stunning film of high based on true events which as told has the clear ring of truth about it this movie is highly emotional and deeply abused and neglected child often becomes in as one of life 's failures be it as a drug or burden on fisher as a young adult in the navy is troubled he is on the brink of being a loser he is in therapy by a and it is that relationship which takes 
 and i repeat please do not see this movie this is more than a review this is a warning this sets the record for the worst most comedy ever made at least with most of the recent the are crude and flat but the writers and directors put in at least some sort of effort into making them funny i never get tired of one of my favorite everyone thinks they can do comedy and only N percent of them 
 to be i used to like this show and watch it regularly but now god i do n't understand why did i watch it sex and the city is one of the most and tv shows i 've ever seen i really do n't get the point of this show despite of trying people are saying that sex and the city is funny in what way by all the time talking about and the size of the give me a

 it is i and i welcome you to the first ever review show my movie for this week was what route what movie what excellent four star would i choose guess what i decided to pull a one and go the other route i 've decided to review a movie so that it totally killed what could have been a very unique concept the movie i will review today is jack two of the killer the stars in this movie 
 heroes is clearly the best film of the year it was a complete and to watch i was the whole audience up at the five was when the film ended no one moved spoke nothing i think this film is a perfect example of the of the power that drama has especially in so much as it sets an example of the quality of work of this younger generation there were moments in your film many like at least seven 
 this movie is a to the major league franchise i live in minnesota and even i ca n't believe they dumped cleveland yes i realize at the time the real indians were pretty good and the had taken over their spot at the bottom of the american league but still be consistent anyway i loved the first major league liked the second and always looked forward to the third when the indians would finally go all the way to the 
 a of 's los but this time with a living breathing as a lead for the dubious advantage of an english sound track we endure tom cruise 's performance as usual with zero yes the character is identified with his but we usually are given some character that to hold our interest his empty any energy that could have been between his character and cruz or is an acting exercise that involves using to free the actor to his presentation 
 when i first in on this morning news i thought finally some entertainment it was slightly amusing for a week or so but we have to face it these news reporters if one can even call them that have way too much playing around first i thought was a of fresh air but seriously this woman has got not the least bit of journalist in her she is very she keeps on steve when he starts the viewers about a 
 i got this one a few weeks ago and love it it 's modern light but filled with true of life it questions and answers just like other fox movies this is my favorite along with & this pictures a lot more than only the we may live in you do n't need to be jewish or homosexual to enjoy this i 'm not but the movie goes directly to my top ten movies at first it seems like pure 
 a that 's N minutes too long a setting with atmosphere and possibility an abandoned is by a of a script filled with dialogue that 's to be mostly it 's just embarrassing and the attempts at fall flat a sample of this movie 's dialogue after her fast shot to a of 's character she any questions ' bad acting jokes and judging from the effects it looks like the director 's watched the evil dead ' way too 
 the first movie about the time travelers was actually funny i like jean as an actor but there was more there were unexpected funny situations and of course plain that would you a little bit of louis de this has the same characters the same actors in great part and the same time traveling the plot changes a little since the characters now are supposed to be experienced time travelers so they jump up and down in history without paying 
 john plays a marine who is by a while fighting on and who has to learn to live with his he has all the about and is sure he 'll be a burden to everyone the hospital staff and his fellow ca n't get through to him neither can his girl back home played by parker he 's and by his own fears and it 's a complex role that carries off in a great performance that keeps one watching

 this is your typical junk are almost no no genuine moments no lines no scenes where you think to yourself that was nothing the plot is bad it 's to look at and boring as hell there is no substance here this movie has nothing it does n't matter if was in this or not a movie is a movie no matter who 's involved also david is a who plays the same character in ever show that he 's 
 i thought this movie did a down right good job it was n't as creative or original as the first but who was expecting it to be it was a whole fun the more i think about it the more i like it and when it comes out on i 'm going to pay the money for it very every last cent sharon stone is great she always is even if her movie is horrible but this movie is n't 
 bad plot bad dialogue bad acting the that ran continually over the script and a copy of the can not be redeemed by liquor trust me because i stuck this turkey out to the end it was so bad all over that i had to figure it was a of for girl who played was the only spark of interest and that was only because she could better than the you want to watch something similar but a thousand times 
 i am a catholic taught in schools by taught by in high school & college i am still a practicing catholic but would not be considered a good catholic in the church 's eyes because i do n't believe certain things or act certain ways just because the church tells me back to the movie its bad because two people are killed by this who is supposed to be a as the of a female there is no comedy in 
 i 'm going to have to disagree with the previous comment and side with on this one this is a second rate vicious western that and trying to put across its central theme of the wild west being and kicked aside by the steady march of time it would like to be in the tradition of and the kid but lacks that film 's and andrew 's direction is and the final N minutes or so are a real with 
 no one expects the star movies to be high art but the fans do expect a movie that is as good as some of the best episodes unfortunately this movie had a plot that just left me this is by far the worst of the nine so far movies even the chance to watch the well known characters in another movie ca n't save this movie including the scenes with kirk and at would say this movie is not worth
